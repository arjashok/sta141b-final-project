nicolascaramella,-1.0,"It's the most anticipated film of this first part of the 81st Venice International Film Festival. And after the first viewing you immediately understand why.
It pushes the boundaries of sensuality, sex, sound, ambition, morality and feminism.
All this is possible thanks to a captivating Nicole Kidman, an intimate script and direction by Halina Reijn and a production by A24, which as always never disappoints.",2024-08-30T20:08:38.208Z,1097549,5 stars,0.6357856392860413
CinemaSerf,6.0,"Business executive ""Romy"" (Nicole Kidman) is initially impressed with the dog-handling skills of ""Samuel"" (Harris Dickinson) but when she discovers that he is to be an intern in her e-packaging company something else starts to draw her to the man. We already know that though happily enough married to ""Jacob"" (Antonio Banderas) she's not exactly fulfilled in the bedroom department, and ""Samuel"" seems to sense that it's an area that maybe he can help with. Were not just talking sex, here - oh. no. This is about a lady with fantasy of being dominated. About her surrendering control completely, and if you're going to do that at all, then why not this tall, handsome and mischievous bit of rough? Of course, like any addiction - it starts to get out of control as the relationship dynamic changes quite profoundly and others start to put two and two together. At times this is quite funny, and milk seems to play a central role from time to time, but as a cinematic version of something akin to tantric, it doesn't really work. Neither of these actors are afraid to get naked yet neither do, simultaneously, here. Indeed I'm sure I saw his black Calvin's shining from under the sheet when the intimacy consultant was at their busiest. I didn't need nudity to augment their unique sort of passion, but I did expect something way more natural, visceral even, and I didn't get it. It's filmed in such a disjointed and bitty fashion, there's no attempt to characterise or contextualise either of these people and in the end I felt like this was little better than a titillation for it's stars that didn't really aspire to engage those watching any more than age-related porn might. Dickinson isn't remotely charismatic and the premiss falls flat quickly, especially when the quite aggravating intervention of ""Esme"" (Sophie Wilde) rather summed the shallowness of the whole thing up. ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (1999) or ""Beach Rats"" (2017) showcase both their talents amidst a sexually charged environment far better: this is all forgettable, over-hyped, stuff.",2025-01-11T11:13:53.910Z,1097549,2 stars,0.5718554258346558
r96sk,5.0,"<em>'Babygirl'</em> is sex and bugger all else. It features two of the more freaky characters in cinematic history, they both kinda creeped me out I'm not going to lie - I will never look at a tie in the same way again, or a glass of milk for that matter. Kudos for creativity, I guess!

Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson do commit to their respective roles, some of the noises coming out of the former were quite something to witness. In fairness, if this is what they were going for then both actors do a fine job. Antonio Banderas is at least there to add sort of normality.

Impressively, aside from a few nips, there isn't much nudity in this, how you show so much without showing barely anything is actually quite the thing. I'm not against seeing films of an erotic nature, I just personally need a bit more substance attached to it. I'm fascinated to see the reception this got, I've no idea.",2025-01-24T01:51:49.336Z,1097549,3 stars,0.4194210469722748
Admiral Toad,4.0,"Babygirl is the story of high-strung CEO who secretly desires to be dominated and controlled. She instead gets into a weird relationship with a young intern who kind of is interested in the same thing, but also just is worried about how much milk she is drinking? There relationship develops throughout the movie but not in any interesting way. At one point he makes her stand in a corner and the music is weirdly intense for no real reason. 

Also we are expected to believe that she would cheat on Antonio Banderas with this weird looking lanky kid that doesn't know how to comb his hair?",2025-01-27T13:43:51.298Z,1097549,3 stars,0.463749498128891
RalphRahal,2.0,"Babygirl (2024) is yet another attempt at making a “provocative” drama that leans too much on surface-level shock value rather than compelling storytelling. The plot, if you can call it that, revolves around an imbalanced relationship dynamic that lacks any real emotional depth. There is no real buildup, no effort to make the audience care about these characters beyond their physical interactions, and certainly no originality. The film tries to be daring, but instead, it feels like a predictable series of events with little payoff.

The directing is uninspired, relying on overused shaky cam techniques that have no business in a drama like this. The cinematography does nothing to elevate the story, and at times, it feels like the camera is as lost as the script. The only real standout performance comes from Antonio Banderas, but he’s barely in the movie. Nicole Kidman, despite her talent, is stuck in a role that feels more about aesthetics than substance. And of course, we have the usual over-the-top praise for a “bold sexualized performance,” the same kind of overhyped reaction we saw with Demi Moore in Substance, as if established actors being in explicit scenes somehow qualifies as groundbreaking cinema.

The script is painfully weak, with dialogue that does little to make the characters feel real or relatable. The film spends too much time trying to push a message without taking the time to craft an engaging narrative. There are moments where it seems like it might go somewhere interesting, but then it falls back into the same repetitive themes. The pacing is another issue, dragging through unnecessary moments while rushing past anything that could have added depth.

The score is outright annoying. It doesn’t complement the film or enhance any of the scenes, it’s just there, adding to the discomfort in all the wrong ways. In the end, Babygirl tries to be provocative but lacks the intelligence or creativity to make an impact. It’s the kind of movie that confuses shock value with substance, leaving you wondering what the point of it all was.",2025-02-15T22:52:17.488Z,1097549,2 stars,0.6770524382591248
CinemaSerf,7.0,"I grew up in an household that loved Bob Dylan and Joan Baez (though not equally from parent to parent!), and I think it really only instilled in me a sense of contrariness. The more my dad banged on about how great Dylan and his lyrics were, the more that fell of deaf childish ears. Sitting down now I was worried I'd revert to my self of fifty-odd years ago, but thanks to a pretty convincing effort from Timothée Chalamet I actually found my feet moving - and not towards the door! It doesn't do him any harm that he resembles the man, and he manages to convey something of the spirit of this poet who, upon hearing that Woody Guthrie (Scoot McNairy) is on his last legs in hospital, travels to New York to track him down. He finds Pete Seeger (Edward Norton) at the bedside of a sick man, plays him a song he's written about his hero and now thanks to some patronage from Seeger he starts to get gigs, meets ""Sylvie"" (Elle Fanning) then the already successful Baez (Monica Barbara) before taking the world - and Johnny Cash (Boyd Holbrook) by storm. It's a classy biopic that, though chronological, isn't just a straight history of the man. It shows his character, warts and all, as he comes to terms with his success and some of the temptations and fickleness that goes along with it. Many critics say Dylan is the worst singer of his own songs and Chalamet keeps up that tradition offering some authentic sounding, but different enough, interpretations of some of the man's most recognisable songs. Barbaro also turns in well as Baez, though I found her voice just a little too operatic and not quite as effective. The production is clearly high-end with loads of attention to the detail, but essentially this is really a chance for Chalamet to show he is more than just a (very) skinny boy with floppy hair. Purists of the artiste may hate it, but I think it quite powerfully characterises this group of free thinking individuals in a 1960s America dealing with a presidential assassination, communist threats and a general sense of paranoia amongst a public that was clearly crying out for something to hope for. Dylan et al delivered some of that, and this comes across well.",2025-01-21T06:48:40.934Z,661539,4 stars,0.42694973945617676
Brent Marchant,6.0,"Tribute biographies have become an increasingly popular film genre in recent years, though, truthfully, they’re not all of the same caliber. Content and authenticity play significant roles in their overall quality, but, as experience has shown, these traits can vary widely, depending on the picture. As for writer-director James Mangold’s homage to musician-folk singer-songwriter Bob Dylan (Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet), the film presents viewers with a mixed bag on these fronts. While this effort seems to mostly get things right in matters of authenticity, it comes up somewhat short on content, despite its protracted 2:21:00 runtime, what should amount to sufficient duration to nail down the most crucial cinematic particulars. “A Complete Unknown” follows Dylan from his arrival in New York in 1961, where he quickly became the latest sensation on the Greenwich Village folk music scene, through his rise to stardom as an emerging music industry icon and culminating in his controversial performance at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, where he traded in his acoustic guitar for an electric model, a switch met with mixed reactions but that launched him in innovative new directions musically. Along the way, viewers are let in on passing scenes from his personal life, such as his friendships with fellow musicians Pete Seeger (Oscar nominee Edward Norton), Johnny Cash (Boyd Holbrook) and Woody Guthrie (Scoot McNairy), as well as his passionate but stormy romances with Sylvie Russo (a pseudonym for real life love interest Suze Rotolo) (National Board of Review Award winner Elle Fanning) and fellow folk singer Joan Baez (Oscar nominee Monica Barbaro). But, regrettably, much of the narrative is little more than a loosely strung together collection of sequences designed to showcase an array of Dylan’s greatest hits from the early days of his career, as well as those of his peers. While the songs are indeed capably performed by the actors themselves, after a while though, the film feels more like an anthology of music videos than an insightful biography. In fact, Dylan’s character comes across as largely enigmatic and inscrutable, a take on his persona alleged to be true to form but that doesn’t offer a great deal of enlightenment into his nature – that is, other than often making him look like a first-class jerk (the noble content of his social activism compositions notwithstanding). Consequently, this candid but somewhat unflattering approach almost makes one wonder whether a protagonist like Dylan is innately worthy of such an homage, even if the finished product is on point (and ironically lends credence to the meaning of the film’s title, whether intentional or not). All things considered, on balance, the filmmaker’s effort here is passable as a capably made tribute bio, with generally fine performances (especially Fanning, who genuinely should have earned supporting actress award kudos over her somewhat overrated co-star), commendable period piece production values and a fine soundtrack (if one is an ardent Dylan fan, that is, something I honestly can’t claim to be). But is this release really worthy of all the awards season attention it has garnered? That seems like something of a stretch to me, but, given the lackluster nature of the crop of 2024 awards season candidates, the pickings have admittedly been somewhat slim. Devotees of the protagonist are virtually certain to come away from this offering suitably impressed, though the rest of us are more likely to heave a modest shoulder shrug and move on to the next movie.",2025-01-28T07:03:36.190Z,661539,3 stars,0.5809155106544495
r96sk,8.0,"<em>'A Complete Unknown'</em> is a biopic worth watching. I only know of Bob Dylan by name and possibly some vague recognition of a few of his songs, as is usual for me it seems; uncultured swine. Therefore, I was only coming into this to see how it came out as a film - it's very good!

Timothée Chalamet's portrayal is impressive for the large majority, I will say his schtick comes across as a little forced in one or two parts (only one or two) and I also had difficulty totally understanding him in a few moments (only a few). Edward Norton is good too, I thought he'd feature more; if only because I saw him on the promo trail with Chalamet a lot.

Elle Fanning and Monica Barbaro offer noteworthy performances, everyone on the cast is perfectly fine to be fair. The music seems well done to me, again I'm not someone who definitively knows Dylan's work but it felt well shown. It's possibly too prevalent, which is a weird thing to say about a musician biopic but there's a lot of music in this.

The end at the festival is the scene that I'll remember most from this, the sound design is particularly excellent; was practically bouncing in my seat due to the noise. If I was to mention any negatives, or at least things that aren't proper positives, it would be the pacing and run time. Not that I'd explicitly class those as bad parts of this though.",2025-01-31T01:22:59.877Z,661539,4 stars,0.6871350407600403
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,-1.0,"Bob Dylan fans should know that director James Mangold’s “A Complete Unknown” isn’t trying to do an in-depth study of the folk music legend, but it’s a solid ride for anyone who loves his music or is curious about his early days. The film gives us a peek into the ‘60s when Dylan was just starting to make waves, showing him as this enigmatic, difficult, and very self-absorbed figure who was about to change the music world for the better.

A real treat for fans of Dylan’s music, the film captures the essence of the man without trying to over-analyze him. The story gives a cool glimpse of who he was during the pivotal time in his career when he went from a fresh-faced, unknown folk singer to a game-changing, controversial figure.

Timothée Chalamet does a fantastic job portraying Dylan, both in terms of his look and his attitude. He channels the aloof, enigmatic, and often prickly demeanor that Dylan has always been (and remains) famous for. In reality, it’s a well-known fact that Dylan’s always been a bit of a jerk, and Chalamet nails that part of his personality. It’s not so much about exploring Dylan’s selfish psyche as it is about watching him move through this phase of his life, seemingly unaware or uninterested in the way he’s affecting those around him. His relationship with the iconic musicians in his orbit, like Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro, in a wonderfully understated performance) and Johnny Cash (Boyd Holbrook, who completely chews up the screen that is oh-so-Cashlike), feels a little cold and distant, which makes sense for the character.

The film centers around the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, the infamous event where Dylan electrified his sound and alienated some of his folk music fans in the process. This moment, which was a major turning point in his career, is depicted in a way that focuses on the tension and not just the performance itself. Dylan’s self-centeredness and drive to push boundaries are clear, but the film doesn’t really dig too deep into the reasons behind his decisions. In other words, Dylan’s just kind of doing his thing, as artists often do.

The supporting cast is solid as well, with Ed Norton as Pete Seeger adding some nice weight to the narrative, and Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo playing a key role in Dylan’s personal life.

The standout, of course, is the music. The renditions of Dylan’s classic songs are excellent (with Chalamet performing the tunes himself), and the film captures the electric energy of the era’s folk scene.

“A Complete Unknown” doesn’t offer much new insight into Dylan as a person, but if you’re a fan of his music and the era, it’s a blast to spend time with him. This is not a groundbreaking biopic, but a fun, nostalgic journey through a key moment in music history.

GenerationofSwine,1.0,"I wanted to see it in the theater, but on the way there I realized that I don't smoke enough pot to like more than a couple of his songs and one of them I liked better when Jimi did it anyway, so my wife and I went on a bike ride instead and I waited until it hit Hulu.

The thing about it is, despite not liking his music, I do like the music from his era a hell of a lot, and the trivia, and even the conspiracies around them that I only sometimes believe... no, it's 2025, I don't know what to believe... but I know enough about Bob to be dangerous and that sort of means I know enough about him to be irritated on it's total lack of accuracy.

I'm pretty sure AI wrote the bulk of the script.  It's not that he wasn't iconic, I get that he was, I even understand why people like him, and Rod Stewart, I even like the occasional singer that is constantly off key, that wasn't the problem.  The problem was that it wasn't a movie about Bob.  It felt more like AI looking at Ray, Bohemian Rhapsody, Walk the Line, La Bamba, Great Balls of Fire, the biopics of famous musicians, combined it with Almost Famous, and then generated a generic script based on what AI thought his life story should be based of the success of other music biopics.

There are parts of this movie I really like. It is almost like gothic poetry painted onto the screen and in a way it is beautiful. Another part of me was a little disappointed with a certain look Nosferatu had. I thought he would looke more like the classic but once I put that aside I truly enjoyed this movie. Lily Depp's physical performance actually surprised me and she deserves some recognition for it.",2025-01-01T16:14:26.332Z,426063,4 stars,0.7296801805496216
r96sk,7.0,"<em>'Nosferatu'</em> didn't quite hook me, but there is enough about it that I can consider it as a good film. The visuals are splendid, as are the gothic horror elements. On the cast, Lily-Rose Depp impresses, as does (more minimally) Emma Corrin and I'm always happy to see Willem Dafoe.

I do continue to feel quite nonplussed by Nicholas Hoult. I did like him in fellow 2024 release <em>'Juror #2'</em>, but in this I've kinda reverted to feeling unmoved by him onscreen. I'm not entirely sure why as he seems a likeable chap, yet his performances just don't really register - which admittedly sounds harsher than I intended.

Bill Skarsgård as Count Orlok is also a part of this flick that I'm unsure on. Does he look the real deal? Absolutely, no complaints there, but I particularly found the dialogue with him to be a borderline bumbling mess. I found the scenes directly with Count to be the least interesting.

I would also say that the movie goes on for a bit too long, though I admit that probably is more of a personal shout than one that is to be set in stone; because if you love this, it'll be the perfect length I'm sure. For me, I feel like they went around the houses a tad. With that said, I did highly enjoy that final scene with Depp - very good!

Those last paragraphs make it sound like I have a dislike for this film. I do not. It just has some noteworthy points that I felt the need to mention. As I type, having not looked at how this has been received, I'd be shocked if this wasn't rated high. Either way, this is worth a watch.

This is my third Robert Eggers film. I loved <em>'The Northman'</em> (9/10) but I, honestly, hated <em>'The Lighthouse'</em> (4/10).

Quite a stark contrast even so, kinda fascinated to see how <em>'The Witch'</em> hits me when I get around to that at some point.",2025-01-03T18:38:46.527Z,426063,3 stars,0.56964111328125

CinemaSerf,7.0,"""Tom"" (Nicholas Hoult) is lovingly married to ""Ellen"" (Lily-Rose Depp) but they haven't much money. That could change, though, as his boss ""Knock"" (Simon McBurney) charges him with a very special mission. He must travel from his German home to the mountains of Carpathia where he must facilitate the sale of a ruined manor house to the reclusive ""Count Orlok"" (Bill Skarsgård). His journey is riddled with portents of suspicion and doom; those he encounters warm him to turn back - but on he goes until he arrives at the castle and is greeted by his enigmatic host. What he thinks is the contract to seal the deal on the house is anything but, as he is soon tormented in his dreams. Many hundreds of miles away, his wife is also suffering - and that causes his best friend ""Friedrich"" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) to call in ""Dr. Sievers"" (Ralph Ineson) who in turn looks to the scientifically ostracised ""Prof. von Franz"" (Willem Dafoe) for some answers. There are no tangible causes, and the professor quickly concludes that it is evil that's at work and that the continuing and inexplicable absence of her husband, his employer and a recently arrived plague of rats are all part of the supernatural causes of her melancholy. There might be a solution, but that requires an act of supreme sacrifice on the part of the young ""Ellen"", or can her husband and his friends find another way? I'm not really a fan of two-parters, but I think in this case that might have been a better solution for Robert Eggers. We have a brief historical introduction to the Count and to the underlying cause of all of the troubles for ""Ellen"" but for the first hour of the film we don't really develop the characters enough, nor sow the seeds for the mysticism especially well. He relies too heavily on our knowledge of the Galeen story of ""Nosferatu"" (as opposed to the Bram Stoker ""Dracula"" one). I could have done with more depth to that chronology. Once ""Orlok"" is on his voyage and afterwards in the town where his merciless behaviour causes misery and panic, we seem to hit the accelerator and rush to the conclusion as if the cock really were about to crow any minute. There simply isn't time to allow the menace to accumulate. Though the visuals are impressively bleak, most of the acting is remarkably bland. Hoult manages to exude some decent terror now and again, but ATJ is really wooden; it takes too long for Depp to show us what she can bring to this under-exposed character and we just don't see anywhere near enough of the ghoulish ""Orlok"" to understand what this story is essentially all about. It's a gothic, dark, gloomy love story. A story of deceit and betrayal and I wanted more. I wanted to feel a little more invested in the characters: to sympathise, to pity, to fear, even. Perhaps a director's cut is in the offing? It's a great watch on a big screen, but I have to admit to being just a little disappointed.",2025-01-09T09:15:18.370Z,426063,3 stars,0.5030404925346375

MovieGuys,7.0,"""Nosferatu"" tries far too hard to be something, it could more readily have been, with a lighter touch.  

You can see what they are going for, a creepy noir, horror fantasy. The problem is, it feels obsessively over stylised, to the point of leaden Gothic oppressiveness. Its a quality that infects the characterisations, as well. They feel over stated, too much larger than life (or is that death) and as a a result, at times, farcical. 

The story itself, to those who have read Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", is mostly familiar.  A few amendments have been made to bring it more in line with the original  ""Nosferatu"" directed by F. W. Murnau, way back in 1922. Count Dracula has been replaced by Count Orlock, for example. I did feel the ending (which also departs from the novel) was a ""bit thin"" and somewhat underwhelming.

I will say, in spite of its limitations, I don't hate this film. Its clear a lot of effort and care has been invested into its creation. I think too, certain dramatic and visual aspects of the Gothic film noir approach, are creepily memorable. 

In summary, ""Nosferatu"" is a valiant effort that would have been markedly better with gentler handling. A balance of the dark aspects of the film with a more subtle, lighter approach would have led to a superior final product. 

Ultimately a rather emotionally and visually, cumbersome watch, you might want to spread over a couple of evenings.",2025-01-31T20:05:53.524Z,426063,2 stars,0.41730818152427673
RalphRahal,5.0,"Nosferatu (2024) marks the third remake of the original 1922 film, and at this point, you have to wonder, how many times do we need to see this story retold? It’s also part of a ridiculously long list of Dracula-related films, with nearly 95 adaptations floating around. While this version brings fresh cinematography and a chilling atmosphere, it doesn’t reinvent the story in any significant way. The plot follows the familiar beats of Count Orlok’s eerie presence and growing obsession, but it takes its time getting anywhere. The directing leans heavily into gothic horror, which works for setting the mood, but sometimes it feels more focused on aesthetics than storytelling.

Visually, the film is stunning. The cinematography is easily its strongest aspect, with haunting lighting, deep shadows, and eerie textures that create a cold, unsettling world. The acting is another highlight, with Bill Skarsgård delivering a terrifying and tragic performance as Orlok. The rest of the cast holds their own, adding depth to the horror. However, the script is where things get shaky. Some moments shine, but others feel drawn out or unnecessarily stiff, making the film drag in parts. The score does a solid job of building tension, though it doesn’t always hit as hard as it could.

One of the strangest creative choices is the inclusion of an oud and belly dancing in Transylvania during Thomas Hutter’s arrival. The scene is heavily choreographed, with villagers giving him a grand welcome that feels eerie and almost ritualistic. It’s a visually striking moment, but the film never explains its purpose. The oud and dance are Middle Eastern cultural elements, not something tied to Transylvania’s history, and after this elaborate introduction, they are never mentioned again. A single question about it is quickly dismissed, making it feel like the filmmakers threw it in for exoticism without considering whether it made any sense. Nosferatu (2024) is a visually impressive and well-acted film, but its slow pacing, script issues, and odd cultural inaccuracies hold it back. If you’re a fan of classic vampire horror, it’s worth a watch, but it doesn’t do much to stand out from the dozens of Dracula films that came before it.",2025-03-07T20:30:33.541Z,426063,3 stars,0.4858343303203583
Wuchak,7.0,"**_Basically, Robert Eggers’ version of Coppola’s “Bram Stoker’s Dracula”_**

In 1838, a newlywed couple living in a town on Germany’s coast on the Baltic Sea are challenged by the troubling dreams of the wife (Lily-Rose Depp) and the husband’s long business trip to Transylvania (Nicholas Hoult). The excursion to the castle of Count Orlok (Bill Skarsgård) takes an utterly frightening turn, but the worst is yet to come when the Count makes it to his decrepit manor in Wisburg.  

“Nosferatu” (2024) was written & directed by Eggers, who was inspired by Henrik Galeen's screenplay for the 1922 film, as well as Bram Stoker's 1897 novel. There are also bits borrowed from “Suspiria” (1977), ""Castle Freak"" and various possession flicks, like “The Exorcist.”

However, I was most reminded of Coppola’s 1992 version of the story. All the main characters are in both movies, just with different names and the Eastern Europe locale switched from London to the fictional Wisburg, Germany. Instead of Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing you have Willem Dafoe as von Franz; in place of Tom Waits as Renfield, there’s Simon McBurney as Knock; instead of Sadie Frost as Lucy, there’s Emma Corrin as Anna; and so on.

Like Coppola’s movie, the production quality is first-rate. Yet this is way scarier and unsettling and, definitely, the creepiest version of the Dracula I’ve seen on film. But it’s not as lush, sexy or entertaining as “Bram Stoker’s Dracula,” not to mention Frank Langella’s 1979 version and many of the Hammer flicks. While this lacks the infamous love story that Coppola & writer James Hart added to Stoker’s tale, it still has something akin to that with Orlok’s attraction to Mina, um, I mean Ellen (Depp).

It kept my interest for the first half, but started losing it in the second (Coppola’s film had the same issue, just not as much). Yet I liked the ending; and the real European locations are preferred over Coppola’s studio-bound sets (which were top-of-the-line; I just favor real locations).

The film runs 2 hours, 12 minutes, with the Extended Cut running four minutes longer (which is the version I saw). It was shot in the Czech Republic at Barrandov Studios in Prague with location shooting done at Rožmitál pod Třemšínem Castle and Pernštejn Castle, as well as Prague's Invalidovna complex. In addition, some exterior shots were done in Corvin Castle in Romania.

GenerationofSwine,5.0,"Well, it's not woke, so it gets points for not screaming POLITICS! POLITICS! POLITICS! at you at the top of it's lungs.  And honestly, that's enough of a novelty to make it passable. It's so rare these days that when you see a movie that's not about pushing a political message, you sort of like it out of principal.  None of the characters are race-swapped, and the audience is so used to seeing period films set in Europe's past with openly Gay characters and Black leads for established white characters, that seeing people who look like they fit the demographics for the location and time the film was set in is... refreshing.

It's just made to entertain, it tries to keep true, visually, character-wise, to what the source material said, and we need more of that.  We want more of that.

But then, it's not exactly good either.  The pacing is off, I mean it's really off.  It seems to all come too fast to really set in as a story.  It needs to take it's time a bit more.  It needs to let the setting and characters settle more... but unfortunately it doesn't.  It just moves from one beat to the next at lightening speed and, honestly, that sort of kills it on a story perspective.  The plot suffered from it too, the fast pace took away from the establishment, so even the Velma information dumps didn't have time to settle.

I have to give a shout out to Lily-Rose Depp, she did try and sell the character.  She was actually better than Willem Dafoe, who needs a Razzy for this. His performance was a little too silly for a horror movie. It was like he was intent not to play it straight and over-acted a bit too much, so much it wouldn't have even played on the stage. Bill Skarsgård wasn't bad, but again, a little over the top. 

Let's face it, in the 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s this would have been considered bad.  The ratings would have been lower, but it's the 2020s, and the fact that it was just made to tell a story, just made to entertain, made with no lectures, no politics, that redeems it, that sets it apart.  People like it more because it left out the crap that they are tired of having rubbed in their faces every day.  Ultimately, though, there are better movies, better vampire movies, and this one only feels good because, unlike ""The Last Voyage of the Demeter,"" they made a vampire move set in the 19th Century, without adding and overwhelming injection of modern day politics.",2025-04-20T21:07:07.692Z,426063,3 stars,0.44679316878318787
Brent Marchant,8.0,"Pursuing the American Dream is an ambition of almost every immigrant who manages to make it to this country’s shores. Its realization can take many forms, too, depending on one’s circumstances. But, as many new arrivals discover for themselves, there’s no guarantee of success (or, at the very least, they may find that the journey can be more problematic than anticipated). One such story that provides the focus for this optimistic undertaking is the latest offering from writer-director Brady Corbet. The film follows the odyssey of László Tóth (Adrien Brody), a fictional Jewish Hungarian architect who flees Europe in 1947 after being interred in a concentration camp during World War II. He initially struggles to assimilate, to re-establish his career, and to find a way to bring his wife, Erzsebét (Felicity Jones), to America. But, despite these sundry challenges, his fortunes change drastically when he’s commissioned to design a high-profile mixed use community center with the generous support of a wealthy and powerful benefactor, a capricious, enigmatic industrialist (Guy Pearce) whose many impulsive, emotionally charged whims provide László with a firsthand introduction to the many possibilities and pitfalls tied to that elusive American Dream. In telling this story, the filmmaker explores the ups and downs associated with these themes, as well as an array of additional diverse story threads involving the protagonist’s professional pursuits and personal life. These combined elements make for an engaging and intriguing tale, even if some of the story arcs and character traits are unevenly developed. That sometimes includes the nature of László himself, which is somewhat perplexing given the production’s hefty 3:35:00 runtime (with an included intermission), a duration that should provide ample time for the picture to sufficiently flesh out its core narrative elements and character attributes. That shortcoming aside, though, “The Brutalist” has myriad strengths to its credit, including the fine performances of Pearce, Jones, Golden Globe Award winner Brody and a host of capable supporting players, along with its superb cinematography, stirring original score, and ably sustained pacing (quite a commendable feat for a film of this length). Admittedly, this offering’s solid opening act is far superior to its back half, which tends to sag at times as it wears on, but, on balance, this Golden Globe winner for best drama and best director generally holds up well. In an awards season that has had more than its share of dismal disappointments, it’s heartening to finally find a release that comes closer to approaching the standards that a film should embody to merit the kinds of accolades and attention such honorees truly deserve. It may not be perfect, but it’s a far sight better than many of its other 2024 cinematic peers.",2025-01-11T00:33:53.717Z,549509,4 stars,0.538498044013977

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Did this really need to be 3½ hours long? Well, no - I don't think so. As far as it goes, though, it features a stunning performance from Adrien Brody as fictional Hungarian architect ""Tóth"" who has manages to survive some torrid wartime experiences in Europe and make it to New York. He has family there, and that's the conduit to a meeting with the wealthy ""Van Buren"" (Guy Pearce) who decides that he wants him to design a public utility building - think Hearst Castle only without any style or shape to it. Indeed the title could very well be applied to his fascist style of bleak and angular artistry, but his new benefactor is prepared to commit £850,000 to the project so he's delighted. That's clearly to the chagrin  of ""Harry"" (How Alwyn) whose role here is that of a meddlesome provoker as he he constantly tries to intervene between the architect and his father. ""Van Buren"" senior also manages to facilitate his repatriation with wife (Felicity Jones) and her niece ""Zsófia"" (Raffey Cassidy) but that doesn't quite go to plan either, and soon seems to further pile on the increasing misery for a ""Tóth"" who is treading on eggshells on all fronts now as he tries to build his charm-free edifice. The centrepiece of this is to be an altar stone, and for that he and his boss travel to the mountains of Carrara, rarely seen in film since Charlton Heston saw the ceiling of the Sistine in the clouds there. Here something shocking happens that ultimately changes the whole dynamic of that relationship and of the film itself. It's this last twenty minutes that I felt saw the wheels come off. The thrust of the story throughout appears to emphasise the man and his family as outsiders. As them being a means to an end and little better than a commodity to be used and abused as one of the ""Van Buren"" men see fit, but the drunken violence that concludes the story seems excessively designed to disgust for the sake to it. Why? I didn't get it, nor the consequent denouement. It's also interesting that much is being made of the VistaVision angle. That which put so many from Humphrey Bogart to John Wayne on the big screen decades ago now appears to have been ""rediscovered"" as if it were revelatory. Well it might help the photography, but not the story - and that begins to run out steam before the unnecessary (from a plot perspective) intermission. Part one offers a compelling look at obsession and the odious nature of patronage and hypocrisy. Part two isn't nearly so good, is more soapy and far less substantial - there is plenty going on but none of the threads really get the attention they need to make them interesting, or to ant them together cohesively. Brady Corbet has one hell of an imagination but perhaps this needed a more objective, and judicious, hand at the tiller. It's good, but it's not anything like as good as it's being hyped up to be. A big screen is essential, though. It will look depressingly ordinary on the television.",2025-01-29T11:21:13.143Z,549509,2 stars,0.4178313910961151
Chandler Danier,8.0,"This movie is excellent. Beautiful. Good story. Funny stuff. Drama. Twists and turns.

Manuel São Bento,7.0,"The Brutalist is a slow-burn period drama that dives deep into the personal struggles of an immigrant protagonist driven by artistic ambition, trying to belong in a systematically adverse society. Through a mesmerizing, award-worthy performance by Adrien Brody, the filmmaker Brady Corbet focuses on the character's journey - navigating discrimination, family estrangement, and drug addiction - which is a compelling, intimate study of resilience.

The architectural backdrop of a landmark institution being constructed serves as the main narrative that, while visually stunning through Lol Crawley's impeccable cinematography, ultimately fails to hold the same weight as the personal story, despite the evident parallelisms and metaphors. Daniel Blumberg's immersive score adds a layer of tension, creating an emotional undercurrent that enhances the viewing experience despite the slow pacing.

The three-hour-and-a-half runtime can feel like a test of patience at times, especially with certain moments feeling repetitive or redundant. However, The Brutalist ultimately justifies its length, with the intermission offering a much-needed break in the otherwise epic storytelling. Personally, I feel like I'm in the minority on the positive side as I don't feel as blown away or impressed by the movie, but it's definitely a must-watch film of 2024.

r96sk,10.0,"<em>'The Brutalist'</em> is simply outstanding. The biggest compliment I can pay it is that the run time of 215 minutes (!) comes and goes in a flash, the interval at ~1h 40m hit me like a brick! It's a perfect example of not overthinking run times, as long as what's onscreen is good it'll fly by.

I'm not going to be able to add anything fresh to it what has already been lauded about this film, all I can say is that every inch of praise is unequivocally warranted. In regards to the Oscars, I agree that <em>'Anora'</em> smashed it out of the park greater but it's a close run thing. Two spectacular movies!

Adrien Brody's performance is indeed sensational, he is an actor I've seen in bits down the years and have always been impressed so I loved be able to see him act front and centre in such a grand, tremendously made picture. He nails every part of László Tóth. I couldn't imagine any other actor in the role.

Guy Pearce is also a brilliant performer here, obviously <em>'Momento'</em> remains his best work (that I've seen, anyway) but this is the greatest I've seen from Pearce away from that Christopher Nolan flick. He is superb! Joe Alwyn and Felicity Jones merit praise too. Nice to see Jonathan Hyde, as well.

I don't think there is anything about this film that you could truly say is bad. The cinematography is particularly awesome, so is the score, the editing and practically every other detail. It's a quality piece of filmmaking. The first half is stronger than the second, but it's negligible.",2025-03-04T20:07:21.836Z,549509,5 stars,0.5760350823402405
CinemaSerf,6.0,"So for fifty years, ""GUN"" have kept ""Shadow"" in a gloopy state of stasis deep underground in a top secret facility. All of a sudden he awakens, punches himself out of the place and that means that the director (Krysten Ritter) has to disrupt a family barbecue to engage the services of ""Team Sonic"". Our eponymous blue hedgehog, his best pals ""Tails"" and ""Knuckles"" have settled down to a peaceable life with ""Tom"" (James Marsden) and ""Maddie"" (Tika Sumpter) but realise they have to rise to the occasion so off they go. Imagine their shock, though, when they discover that their new super-fast and super-strong nemesis is another (not quite so blue) hedgehog! Who is he? What's going on? Why does he seem to loath mankind, so? Well that all becomes clear when his puppet-master turns out to be the grand-daddy of all baddies. The ultimate ""Robotnik"" - only with a slightly more rotund belly. Matched, even out-matched, it falls to our intrepid team to try and form an alliance of their own, but how will that endure in the face of such terrible odds? Well don't go looking for any jeopardy here, indeed what starts off as quite a fun series of thwack and pow escapades showing off the skills of the rivals cannot resist turning into the cul-de-sac of sentimentality as the inevitable plot lines grab hold of the characters and turn them into cheesy mush. I always like a good antagonist, but sadly we just know that however dastardly and evil he - in this case the ultra-hammy Jim Carrey - can be, no writer or director is ever going to let him win, and that's pretty efficiently telegraphed right from the start of this sequel that's going to be a prequel too, no doubt. Some of the writing is quite fun, with plenty of contemporary and quite sarcastic references to raise a smile, and there are homages paid aplenty to just about everyone from ""007"" and the ""Fantastic Four"" to the ""Avengers"" - but in the end it's all just a little too shiny and predicable. It looks great on the big screen though and passes a couple of hours easily enough for a Christmas release, but it's all just a bit too derivative for me, sorry.",2024-12-24T09:39:57.504Z,939243,3 stars,0.4197402000427246

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Oh, if only I'd thought of the ""smart gnome"" when I had a garden. It could have proved invaluable with the pruners, the shears and the mower. Unfortunately, though, I didn't and ""Wallace"" did. That's a little to the chagrin of his pal ""Gromit"" who, quite prophetically, worries that things will not end well for this latest in a long line of inventions that usually end up with a mind of their own. What's much more sinister here is the fact that the long incarcerated nemesis of the cheese-loving pair is out for revenge. When ""Norbot"" starts showing just a little too much independent spirit, might there be something more malevolent afoot? Alternatively, of course, ""Gromit"" could let the thing run riot in the hope that maybe it will deter his pal from any more quirky engineering? I have struggled with the thin-ness of the stories in the feature length Aardman animations in the recent past, but this is back to the high standard of the ""Wrong Trousers"" (1993) with characterful mischief throughout, loads of quickly paced and colourful panic and mayhem, some entertaining voice talent to accompany the story and, naturally, chaos of an epic proportion at a denouement that's really quite entertaining. The clay stop-motion figures are hugely expressive and detailed - especially the bug-eyes, but also the oversized hands and with retribution in mind, we've a marvellously, but simplistically, crafted nasty to foil too.

""Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl"" felt, to me, like coming home. Its the kind of clever, down to earth, genuinely British entertainment, I'd once associated with the BBC before the woke, DEI revolution (or is that devolution?).

Once again, Wallace and Gromit are out adventuring. Wallace with his penchant for  invention, gives a new meaning to the term ""garden gnome"". Whilst Gromit, as per usual is left to pick up the pieces when things go wrong and solve the mystery. 

This is great fun from beginning to end. Yes its claymation but its witty and sophisticated enough, to be every bit as enjoyable for adults, as it is for children.

r96sk,8.0,"Rubbish poster aside, <em>'Mufasa: The Lion King'</em> is a success.

I can't overlook that poster, how amateur can you get - it genuinely looks like something I'd whip up seconds before the deadline. Thankfully, the movie itself is very good, it's one I enjoyed quite a bit. The animation is class, the lions look amazingly majestic. I will say the white ones look a bit iffy, but that's nothing even close to a big issue.

The voice cast are all perfectly good. Aaron Pierre, Kelvin Harrison Jr. (only now realising his character wasn't called Tucker... bit embarrassing on my part), John Kani et al. all merit props. The standouts for me, however, are Mads Mikkelsen and Lennie James - two actors I do love watching (or listening to, in this case), admittedly.

Music-wise, it's not the strongest - I can't recall any of the songs, to be honest. That's not actually a terrible thing though, as it means none of the musical numbers grated on me either - and that's always a win in my books. Elsewhere, Timon & Pumbaa are unamusing and wasted, but at the same time are unnecessarily forced into this prequel/sequel.

Obviously, this still falls far adrift of the beloved original animated film. Nevertheless, I'll hold it in higher esteem than the 2019 remake, even if I didn't overly mind that one to be fair.

The pair prove inseparable as they grow up, but the encroachment of a pride of angry white lions led by ""Kiros"" soon threatens their peaceful lives and forces the two to flee in search of a mystical land.

Not that jeopardy is in anyway the point here, it's not that kind of Disney film. It's really just a fairly shameless rip-off of the first, far superior, film that though it looks great with all the integrated live-action visuals has a story that's cheesily wafer thin. It's purpose is to set out the origins of the ""Lion King"" (1994) but all it really does is remind us of just how good that was and just how average this one is. They keep referring to the ""Circle of Life"" but barring a few meanderings from the orchestral score into the songs from the past, we are simply left with some banal offerings from Lin-Manuel Miranda best summed up by ""Bye Bye"" - straight from the Janet and John book of rhyming ""seas"" with ""trees"". Certainly, it looks great but it's also quite confusing whom it's for. The kids watching in the cinema with me were quickly bored by the undercooked story once the awe of the visuals had worn off. It's all perfectly watchable and is quite a testament to the arts of those in the CGI department well worthy of the big screen, but it's all instantly forgettable fayre that just sort of rolls along towards it's rousing denouement unremarkably.",2024-12-24T08:16:48.389Z,762509,3 stars,0.5745130181312561

Aaron Taylor-Johnson offers a glimmer of hope, but this makes for a looooong 2hrs 7mins (why that long, I have no idea).

The first few scenes, whilst nothing exceptional, are actually perfectly OK - I thought so, anyway. Though pretty much from the introduction of a young Calypso (no hate on Ariana DeBose btw, I like her and she tries) the movie quickly spirals. The characters of Russell Crowe and Alessandro Nivola (he, too, tries) are, to put it kindly, rather irritating.

Christopher Abbott's role has some potential attached to it, though that countdown thing got repetitive real fast; almost as quick as 1... 2... nevermind.

Well, yes, but if that's the only card a film has then you might as well get your shirt off and play it! Sadly, that is all that can really be said for this plodding superhero adventure. The ""Kravinoff"" siblings ""Dimi"" (Billy Barratt) and ""Sergei"" (Levi Miller) are taken out of their posh school by their oligarch father (Russell Crowe) and taken on a hunt in Ghana to develop their masculinity. They are on the trail of a lion called ""Czar"" and it's an encounter with him and then with a local girl called ""Calypso"" (Diaana Babnicova) that sees the latter brother emerge injured but changed. Quite profoundly changed too! Skip on many years and the ""Sergei"" (now Aaron Taylor-Johnson) has no relationship with his father, though is still in contact with his brother (now Fred Hechinger), and he has developed some remarkably animalistic ninja skills. He's the ultimate in natural forces for good. Meantime, though, things are hotting up amongst the criminal fraternity and a chance re-encounter with a grown up ""Calypso"" (Ariana DeBose) sets up a denouement with a nasty baddie who has to survive on refrigerated gel packs from his rucksack else he gets especially thick-skinned. Along the way there are several, quite violent, escapades that allow the star to show off his physical prowess, Crowe to show off his thick Siberian accent and Hechinger to look about as weedy as possible. Thereafter there isn't an original bone in it's CGI-fest of a body. The script is actually pretty diabolical and the plot really struggles to get off the ground as this lumbers, quite literally, along for over two hours. It's as if it were a few episodes of a mini-series hastily condensed into a film; it's bitty, disjointed and the denouement is all rather underwhelming.

Firstly, this is a fresh, down to earth, departure from your standard Marvel Franchise films.Idiots in over bright Lycra or Spandex  outfits, are, thankfully, absent. 

Instead, you get a more conventional, satisfyingly  believable, character. One who happens to be have been given special powers, that feel primal and earthy, compared, for example, to hammers and lighting bolts.

Actions reasonable too, with settings I could relate to and a story that's well told, if unsurprisingly, somewhat formulaic.

Dornail,7.0,"Kraven was what I would call a good holiday action film that probably didn't get a good chance.  I have no idea why it seems every Marvel associated movie is getting the fan negativity treatment.  Not every movie will be a triple A Endgame film.  Kraven was a secondary character at best in the comics so I think you have to set your expectations appropriately.  I hope that the movie does well on streaming and physical sales.  I would have liked to see how the story arc would have gone in future films but unfortunately it probably won't get a sequel.

My advice to anyone watching movies these days is go see it yourself and don't believe the charged reviews.

I thought the story was good, the acting was fine and the special effects were done well and more grounded and gritty than your normal super hero movies.  Kraven was another antihero type in this film and I think that worked well for his introduction.

They are unaware of the sale of their project until presented with half a dozen enormous hangars full to the brim of rotting envelopes, packages and their fair share of rats. Chief amongst the newly arrived soldiers is ""Lena"" (Ebony Obsidian) who joined up after her beau ""Abram"" (Gregg Sulkin) went off to war as a pilot and was reportedly killed in action. She, and her determined colleagues, are determined to make a difference and the remainder of this drama depicts their struggles against their own side rife with bigotry and sexism whilst the bombs are never far away and the task is quite literally Herculean - only they can't just divert a river to solve this one. It's a fact, so the conclusion isn't in doubt, and the story is quite an interesting one as it not only challenges stereotypical attitudes, but quite poignantly illustrates how downright counter-productive these were. The execution, though, is all rather bland. Washington is competent but nothing more, indeed that's true of almost all of the acting talent on display here - aside from a lively and earthy effort from Shanice Shantay as the the engagingly rough-around-the-edges Johnnie Mae; and the writing takes a sledge hammer to the racial undertones that, once it's made it's bleedin' obvious point, just proceeds to labour that a bit too heavily. It's fascinating to see glimpses of the ""intelligence"" these women used to repatriate the post with the person and at times it's quite funny too as their intuition and common sense proved astonishingly effective but that's all rather swept under the carpet as the story focusses too much on the soapy elements of their travails. Indeed the ending, and the significance of their achievement, is all just a bit too rushed. It's a film that might have made for a better documentary celebrating the dedication of these ladies. As a piece of cinema, it's at best an high-quality television movie and an over-long one at that.",2024-12-10T06:51:34.840Z,1061699,3 stars,0.49145713448524475
CinemaSerf,7.0,"There's something about the use of the monkey to characterise Robbie Williams that makes this quite a visceral watch at times. The film tells the story of the fairly turbulent rise of this ""Take That"" singer from boyhood exponent of Gilbert and Sullivan to a man on the right end of an £80 millions record deal. His dad (Steve Pemberton) went off to a football match whilst he was a child and never came back, and that left him with his mum ""Janet"" (Kate Mulvany) and adoring nan (Alison Steadman) living a pretty much hand to mouth existence and leaving him with a pretty solid foundation for his later emotional and trust issues. Unless you've lived on the moon these last twenty years, then you'll know much of what happens next. What does make this stand out a little more is the fact that Williams himself is behind the project and is in no way afraid to portray himself as a complete ass. His drink, drugs, tantrums and generally spoilt brattishness are laid bare with little, if any, attempt to sanitise. In some ways it reminded me of the recent ""Amy"" biopic and came hot on the heels of a recent viewing of ""Easter Parade"" (1948) with both serving, for completely different reasons, to augment the thrust of this story of a person who attained great stardom, success and wealth - and ultimately ended up with addictions galore and few, real, friends amidst a sea of hangers-on and parasites all too eager to selfishly cash in on the fame of a lad who started aged just fifteen. Of course it's not exactly balanced, and I'm sure the gospel according to Robbie might not be quite how others see their own behaviour (or his) but there is an honesty to this that brings home just how ruthless the music business is and at just how fickle fame can be when those we idolise lose their lustre. It doesn't do it any harm that many of his solo songs work well through big screen audio with some classy string arrangements and powerful vocals to remind us that, unlike many of the largely forgotten ""Take That"" singles, his music - especially the stuff he made with Guy Chambers - is the stuff we will really long remember. It's not for the faint hearted, but still well worth a watch.",2024-12-28T14:17:28.692Z,799766,4 stars,0.4804292619228363
CinemaSerf,7.0,"I reckon it's quite a testament to the confidence of Nicholas Hoult that he's prepared to take on a role quite this odious. He's ""Bob"", an intelligent white supremacist who has splintered from an arian church scenario and allied with a few like-minded people. The arrival of ""Husk"" (Jude Law) to the area's long abandoned FBI office might put a fly in his ointment, though, as he befriends enthusiastic cop ""Jamie"" (Tye Sheridan) and both try to get to the bottom of the increasingly audacious crimes being carried out in the name of reclaiming the beautiful and unspoilt land of Idaho, and even the broader USA itself, from it's impure interlopers. It's a little slow off the mark, but once we have the battle lines set out and realise that both of these men are capable of playing cat and mouse ruthlessly, the drama gathers a pace that's well held together by the two protagonists. It shines quite a forceful light on the dangers of jingoism and also quite interestingly tries to present us with some modicum of the rationales behind what drives this innate hatred, or at least tolerates it. With an increasing degree of zealousness appearing once again in Europe, this serves as quite a well written and characterful lesson in just how easily traction can be found when fear and loathing are peddled together with ignorance or religion or, most toxically, both. I could have been doing without the agent's familial backstory. It seems we just can't hit the ground running with the story in hand without having to trawl through his past, his traumas and his excessive drinking habits; but I don't suppose that interfered too much as we headed to a denouement that's historical fact, and quite potently presented.",2024-12-28T16:23:50.895Z,1082195,4 stars,0.695402979850769
MovieGuys,7.0,"I found ""The Order"" unsettling but perhaps not quite for the reasons you might think. 

First off, whilst a lot of license has been taken here the bones of this tale of Neo Nazi's attempting to replace the US government in the 1980's really did happen. The facts of the tale have however been misconstrued in a way that makes the core antagonists look worse than they really were. The question then becomes, why? Its not as if they were especially nice people to start with, right? 

In my opinion, its hard not to see a thread of contemporary politicking in this film. In essence the underlying message appears to be the US government are promoters of peace and stability, whilst anyone opposing them is a violent merchant of chaos. Its a simplistic perspective that ignores the real need for change in the USA. A nation that has made political corruption and destructive war, its core business. Moreover, its governmental system has a nasty habit of going after even peaceful, non radical reformers, as well as racist violent ones.

Putting this consideration aside, how does this stack up as a film? Well, I'm seeing Jude Law in a new light. I'd never taken much notice of him in the past but he hands in a top notch performance in the role of an obsessive FBI agent, with a troubled personal life. Indeed, broadly speaking, acting in this film is excellent and it breathes life into the wholly believable characters.

The story flows well too, starting off slowly and gradually picking up pace. I'm not especially a fan of ""terrorists under the bed"", style films so for me to say I enjoyed this, for the most part and found it thoughtful is quite the compliment. 

In summary, excellent acting and a strong script bring this tale of violent political extremists, to life. That said, its worth remembering that not all political reform is bigoted and violent. In fact, sometimes its very much needed. As is the case in the USA and elsewhere in the West, today",2024-12-31T21:07:15.185Z,1082195,3 stars,0.5145059823989868
aholejones,1.0,"The worst movie of 2024

I know that sounds like hyperbole, but Carry-on truly is one the dumbest most asinine movies ever made. The movie is completely devoid of any logic and sense. The plot is idiotic to say the least and the same can be said for everything done by the characters.

I know movies can take artistic freedoms some times, but when you have among other equally brain dead moments scenes of gunshots in airport bathrooms, inside airplanes and stabbings in the middle of busy airport lobbies and nobody somehow magically notices this nor is at all worried about this or the TSA agent acting all erratically you are acting a bit too much of the viewer. I have to say I did have to laugh at how surreal and stupid the scene is where the lead's girlfriend is talking to him in the middle of a airport lobby and a big old red dot appears smack on her forehead and nobody notices anything.

Trust me you don't want to watch this movie. 2024 has been a terrible year for movies, but Carry-on is my nomination for the worst movie of 2024 with zero redeeming factors.",2024-12-15T11:03:08.648Z,1005331,1 star,0.9081595540046692
dumasori,1.0,"**Stay away, you have been warned!**

This movie was so absurd that I felt compelled to write this review to warn others.

From start to finish, it’s a series of implausible and downright ridiculous events. The portrayal of airport security in particular is laughably unrealistic. I hardly know where to begin, but here are just a few examples: there’s a gunfire incident in the airport bathroom that somehow goes unnoticed, a TSA officer is stabbed in a public area with no reaction from anyone, and a random guy drives his van around the airport like it’s his personal property. These are just a few of the endless, nonsensical scenes that will leave you shaking your head in disbelief.

To make matters worse, the protagonist makes one frustratingly foolish decision after another, leaving you more annoyed than invested. It’s almost as if the movie is determined to test your patience at every turn.

This is, without a doubt, the dumbest movie of the year. It doesn’t deserve more than 1 star, and I’m baffled that it has a rating above 6—it’s a joke. Save yourself the frustration and skip this one.",2024-12-18T07:16:58.728Z,1005331,1 star,0.9407439231872559
RalphRahal,7.0,"Jaume Collet-Serra’s ""Carry On"" is a holiday action thriller that blends sharp direction, engaging storytelling, and great performances. The movie’s attention to detail is exceptional, with every scene serving a purpose. Its tightly woven plot moves briskly, delivering compelling twists without unnecessary fluff. This refreshing approach ensures an engaging experience.

Egerton’s performance stands out, portraying a mix of vulnerability and tenacity that makes Ethan relatable. Jason Bateman excels as the chilling antagonist. The emotional depth brought by Collet-Serra’s direction ensures you’re invested in the characters. The cinematography adds to the tension, with creative shots and dynamic angles enhancing the airport setting. Memorable scenes and immersive visuals elevate the story, making the film a visual treat.

""Carry On"" balances its thrills with genuine emotion, offering a gripping, high-stakes narrative about choices and resilience. It’s a smart, thrilling ride that’s well worth the time.",2024-12-20T07:51:35.625Z,1005331,4 stars,0.6444994807243347

r96sk,9.0,"<em>'Carry-On'</em> is a movie that gave me the required entertainment, I found it all to be extremely watchable. There are one or two moments within the first hour that had me questioning how they were going to stretch interest for events onscreen for just short of two hours, but pleasantly they most certainly do.

Taron Egerton and Jason Bateman give excellent performances, I think even without just one or the other the film wouldn't work as nicely - they are the keys to its success, for me. That's not to say it's a production that only relies on its acting talent, because this felt well written; they make the predicament/actions of the characters justified.

I have no doubt that the film uses plenty of artistic licence, as per with movies, but that's something I have zero issue with - as long as it makes the plot more enjoyable, which most definitely is the case here in my opinion. Going back to the cast, nice to see Dean Norris involved; Danielle Deadwyler and Theo Rossi are positives as well.

Best way to sum this up: <em>'Die Hard'</em> meets <em>'Toy Story 2'</em>. I mean, come on, who doesn't wanna see that?!",2025-01-01T12:29:55.522Z,1005331,4 stars,0.613053560256958

CinemaSerf,6.0,"When the King decides to decline an offer for a strategic betrothal for his daughter ""Héra"", a duel ensues that sees the would-be suitor ""Wulf"" swear vengeance on the house of ""Helm Hammerhand"" and the kingdom of ""Rohan"" before he flees to the mountains. Before too long, he has made his presence felt amongst the usually warring hill tribes and is soon a force to be reckoned with by the King. With his capital being attacked, ""Helm"" must lead from the front - but can he trust all of his nobles? It turns out that his daughter and this rebel were childhood friends but it's not just him she doesn't want to marry, she has far more independent designs for her life that don't include marriage at all, and these are actively encouraged by her handmaiden - herself a woman to be reckoned with. With duplicity and tragedy all around her, she must lead her people to the safety of the ""Hornberg"" to avoid the harshness of both her enemy and the brutal winter, but can they survive the ordeal that awaits them. This is a perfectly watchable animated fantasy adventure with the odd snippet of Howard Shore's original ""Lord of the Rings - Two Towers"" (2002) score to pep it up, but the standard of the animation is really quite underwhelming. It's all very two-dimensional and it seemed to me that virtually no effort has been made to synchronise the lips and the voices. The story is adequate enough, but stretched really quite thinly as it tops the two hour mark without anywhere near enough going on. There's isn't so much a war as a siege, and after about half an hour it felt more like this was an introduction to a character who is going to - whether JRR Tolkien likes it or not - deliver some more Middle Earth adventures for sequels galore. It really underplays the characterful mythology of the topic and takes a very disappointingly ""Janet and John"" approach to the mysteries and evils of that realm which was so well captured twenty-odd years ago by Peter Jackson.",2024-12-17T12:53:12.960Z,839033,3 stars,0.4576462507247925
RalphRahal,5.0,"Our Little Secret is a decent Christmas movie that delivers some holiday charm despite its flaws. The script, while serviceable, did feel a bit robotic at times, like it was trying too hard to tick all the holiday movie boxes. That said, the story itself was fun to watch and had enough lighthearted moments to keep things entertaining.

When it comes to the acting, Lindsay Lohan wasn’t at her best here. Her performance felt a bit flat, but thankfully, George Harding and Kristin Chenoweth picked up the slack. They brought a bit more energy and personality to their roles, which helped balance out the film. Chenoweth, in particular, added a touch of wit and warmth that really worked for the festive vibe.

Overall, Our Little Secret isn’t groundbreaking, but it’s an enjoyable watch for the holiday season. It’s the kind of movie you can put on when you’re in the mood for something light and festive. Not perfect, but definitely not bad for a cozy Christmas movie night.",2024-12-17T16:42:05.594Z,1234811,3 stars,0.6010881066322327

Once there, she hopes to break the malevolent force that has, for centuries, ensured that her people never manage to make contact with any others - despite her finding evidence that they did exist - somewhere, once upon a time! Of course there's ""Heihei"" the chicken and ""Pua"" the pig, but she's gonna need more help than that so up steps pin-up ""Moni"", the knife-wielding engineer ""Loto"" and the glass-half-empty farmer ""Keke"" and off they go.

Luckily, ""Matangi"" has also had a run-in with ""Maui"" and so maybe they can all unite now, but can his giant hook and his tattoos empower him to help her to defeat their powerful nemesis? Well, what do you think? Thing is, we're not watching this for any jeopardy or menace from the storyline, we are watching it for the fun characterisations and the engaging dynamic between the eponymous girl and her super-strength demigod. That, sadly, is sadly lacking in this disappointing sequel. The visual effects are super, and the pace of the adventure likewise - but the story is just too thin and the arrival of the new characters doesn't really compensate as it rather procedurally, if colourfully, meanders along without really delving into and exploiting the fantastic depths of culture and mythology at it's disposal. The soundtrack is also nowhere near as catchy, and even though some of the lyrics are quite entertaining, the film lacks a killer song for either leading character. Sure, we've the power ballad ""Beyond"" and ""Maui"" gets the quirky ""Can I Get a Chee Chee"", but they lack the charming silliness of Lin Manuel Miranda's efforts from eight years ago. It's all perfectly watchable, and ought to be seen on a big screen to show off the creatively detailed animation, but I reckon it's entirely forgettable and will probably just serve as a stepping stone to the next one which is certain to follow just as seagulls follow fishing boats.",2024-11-30T10:01:26.914Z,1241982,3 stars,0.4922071099281311

Chris Sawin,2.0,"The film adaptation of Wicked is based on the Broadway musical, which is a loose adaptation of the 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West by Gregory Maguire. Both Maguire’s novel and the musical are expansions of L. Frank Baum’s original The Wizard of Oz novel was published in 1900 and its film adaptation in 1939. The musical is one of the longest-running and financially successful Broadway musicals of all time.

With a screenplay by Winnie Holzman (writer of the book of the Wicked musical) and Dana Fox (Cruella) and directed by Jon M. Chu (Now You See Me 2, Crazy Rich Asians), Wicked begins around the time The Wizard of Oz ends. The Wicked Witch of the West has died and Glinda the Good Witch is breaking the news to Munchkinland. As the munchkins celebrate and burn a giant, Wicker Man-style witch in celebration of the witch’s death, Glinda is asked by one of the munchkins if she knew the witch.

What follows is nearly three hours of how a green-skinned, outcast girl named Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) whose emotions spark wondrous fits of unbelievable magic interacts with the spoiled, entitled, and pink-infatuated Galinda (Ariana Grande) as they enroll in a magic school known as Shiz University.

Visually, Wicked is jaw-dropping and beautiful. All of the talking animals look extraordinary and every sequence with the flying monkeys is a visual highlight. Peter Dinklage voices a goat teacher named Dr. Dillamond and he has one of the most emotional arcs in the film. The bear nurse and dog doctor in the opening moments of the film look so good for what little amount of screen time they have.

Given how many VFX teams are credited in the film, it’s no wonder the CGI looks intricately gorgeous. The three VFX teams with the most credits in Wicked include OPSIS (The Fall Guy, Rescue Rangers), Framestore (Gladiator II, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice), and ILM (Venom: The Last Dance, Alien: Romulus). Then there’s various work from about a dozen different other VFX teams/houses, but the most intriguing one is one called FoyProAI.

FoyProAI doesn’t have an accessible official website, but some digging around on an executive producer’s LinkedIn page gives some background. Foy stands for Fountains of Youth and FoyProAI specializes in de-aging, up-aging, and beauty work in film. They’ve worked on Smile 2, John Woo’s The Killer for Peacock, and 400 shots on Wicked.

There are moments of greatness in Wicked that mostly stem from the chemistry between Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande. Grande’s comedic roots, specifically her time and experience on SNL, really come into play here. Grande is essentially the comedic relief as Galinda as her outgoing personality carries most sequences while Erivo has more of a straightforward performance that has more of a dry delivery.

But the generic musical formula is infuriating. Story beats pause and go out of their way to cater to multiple songs at times and it logically hurts your brain. Yes, it’s a musical and yes people are going to sing. But when the main characters are trying to get away on a flying broom as guards are pounding at the door and they spend another ten minutes dancing, crying, and bellowing about their broken friendship it becomes a nuisance. Get on the damn broom and sing on the way to your destination. It doesn’t seem that hard.

Some sequences are thrown in solely because they’ll make a big song more appealing (the whole rotating library straight out of Inception thing) or side stories that don’t go anywhere because two characters need to seem closer than they are (Elphaba and Fiyero’s awkward ten-minute excursion into the forest to free a lion cub). These are both roundabout executions that take the long way to showcase that Fiyero thinks reading is dumb and that he’s actually in love with Elphaba over Galinda.

The film adaptation seems like it’s quite faithful to its source material, but the Hollywood concept of transforming nasty and recognizable villains into sad, relatable characters that the audience roots for is a dumpster fire of a concept. Pure asshole villains can be fantastic too and often make protagonists more interesting if done right.

But the musical fantasy film treats Elphaba like dirt for the first hour and a half. Everyone looks down on her because of the color of her skin. Then when she finally becomes friends with Galinda, she develops a soft spot for mistreated animals. It’s the main reason she turns against The Wizard of Oz (Jeff Goldblum) apart from being one of the only characters who can read magic spells.

Wicked is Mean Girls at Hogwarts as everybody sucks and is superficial apart from a character that is supposed to be evil. Elphaba mostly accepts the role of wicked witch because her beliefs don’t match anyone else’s and she’s unwilling to adapt to their ways solely to keep the peace.

Wicked features some unreal VFX and even touches on some incredible ideas from time to time, but the ideas that work seem to stem from capitalizing on a fantasy world that was established over a century ago. As a film, Wicked conjures song after song and drags on and on solely because it’s a bloated musical that wants you to die a rhythmic, sometimes undecipherable, high-pitched death.",2024-11-22T19:35:57.756Z,402431,4 stars,0.5808520913124084

I've been a Wicked fan since 2010. My expectations for this film were extremely high! And I was blown away by how Jon M. Chu was able to bring this story a new life. Everyone involved did an excellent job! The choice to sing live paid off! Not one note was out of tune! Bowen Yang & Bronwyn James were absolutely hilarious as Phannee & Shen Shen. Marissa Bode was fantastic as Nessarose. Can't wait to see her story continue in Part 2. I hope they include ""Wicked Witch of the East"" in the Part 2 Soundtrack. Ethan Slater was great as Boq. I'm excited to see how he becomes the Tin Man in Part 2 because that's not shown on stage. He transforms behind the cabinet but I hope we actually see it in Part 2. Michelle Yeoh was great in every scene as Madam Morrible. She was very Wicked! Jeff Goldblum was amazing as The Wizard! I loved the new version of The Grimmerie! The way it opened was very cool! Jonathan Bailey was incredibly charming as Fiyero! Dancing Through Life was very well choreographed and his singing was great! Loved the way he met Elphaba in this version. I'm very intrigued to see him become The Scarecrow in Part 2. Ariana Grande was absolutely phenomenal as Glinda! She embodied everything about Glinda! Loved her homages to past Glindas in Popular. Her voice was very Angelic. You can tell that she studied a lot for this role. Can't wait to hear her ""I'm Not That Girl (Reprise)"". Cynthia Erivo stole the show as Elphaba Thropp. She poured her heart into this character! I'm so excited to hear ""No Good Deed"" in Part 2! She was incredible! As for the Cameos in One Short Day, Loved seeing Stephen Schwartz as The Guard & Winnie Holtzman as an Emerald City Resident. Love the expansion of the Wizomania show to include Kristin & Idina telling the story of The Grimmerie. Loved that Idina did her Elphie Battle Cry. It didn't take away from Cynthia's at the End. The Film was meant to happen in 2024. Had it come out in 2016 or 2019, I don't think it would've been as well done as it was! I can't wait to see Part 2 and how much of The Wizard of Oz they include. I hope we get to see Dorothy's Face. 10/10 No Notes.",2024-11-23T08:02:56.672Z,402431,4 stars,0.33397388458251953
CinemaSerf,7.0,"OK, so I'm going to be swimming against the tide a bit with this, but I didn't love it. We start where the ""Wizard of Oz"" story finishes off, only without the catchy ""Ding Dong the Witch is..."". Instead we get an ensemble dance number that is energetically performed, colourful and expertly choreographed but instantly forgettable. Then we meet ""Galinda"" (Ariana Grande) who arrives in her pink bubble to confirm the news and enjoy the celebrations. Turns out, though, that she and the erstwhile ""Wicked Witch of the West"" were once friends and so back in time we go to the birth of a little green baby who may (or may not) have been conceived within the bounds of happily married wedlock. Scoot on many years more and we discover that said green person - ""Elphaba"" (Cynthia Erivo) is accompanying her wheelchair bound sister ""Nessarose"" (Marissa Bode) to the ""Ozian"" equivalent of ""Hogwarts"" where she encounters the snobbish ""Galinda"" and a fairly comprehensive degree of hostility. Luckily for her, the legendary sorceress ""Madame Morrible"" (Michelle Yeoh) spots some hidden talent in this young woman and soon she is sharing rooms with her new nemesis and finding herself the butt of school jokes. Then enter the mischievous prince ""Fiyero"" (Jonathan Bailey) who tends to treat everyone the same and who's been kicked out of more schools that he can shake a sceptre at. He does, however, manage to create an environment in which everyone can get along and that's when things begin to change for an ""Elphaba"" who is to be made likeable by her now pally roomie. When a letter arrives from the all-powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) summoning her to the ""Emerald City"", then they set off hoping to find answers to all of their questions, only to find that nothing there is as it seems... I have to admit that JB has been a friend of mine for many years, so I ain't going to be saying anything bad about the man who might just be the next ""007"", and both Erivo and Grande do well enough with the set piece musical numbers - especially the lively and cleverly written ""Populer/lar"", but the rest of this just struck me as ""Harry Potter"" goes to the musicals where it meets ""Mean Girls"". Goldblum makes his presence felt, but in the same slightly affected fashion that he aways does, and though the visual effects are all fantastic, somehow they are all just so much more sterile to watch than when you see them within the confines of a theatrical stage - where this works so much better, and without the need for the commercially exploitative part 1 and part 2 released months apart. To be fair, everyone looks like they are enjoying themselves, there's a fun number from Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth and Bailey brings some much needed charm to the proceedings but I'd probably just prefer a director's cut that offered us the whole story in one three hour chunk so we can get that mediocre ""Defying Gravity"" power ballad out of the way (repeatedly) in one fell swoop. It's a very polished production, and maybe the hype has just got to me, but I can't pretend I wasn't disappointed by this.

In this stunningly beautiful and delightful big-screen production, viewers learn how the supposedly evil Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) came to know the purportedly Glinda the Good (Ariana Grande-Butera), sorcery students and college roommates whose relationship initially went through a series of changes from unabashed contempt to solid friendship. However, as high-level political intrigue unfolds in their homeland of the magical land of Oz – efforts clandestinely spearheaded by the supposedly all-powerful Wizard (Jeff Goldblum) and university headmistress Mme. Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) – Elphaba and Glinda become unwittingly caught up in the high-stakes subterfuge playing out around them, a development that jeopardizes the future of their friendship and the stability of Oz itself. The filmmaker thus subtly but effectively presents audiences with a fable on the nature of good and evil, particularly in terms of what actually constitutes wickedness, especially when it’s skillfully veiled. The result is a thoughtful and thoroughly entertaining tale replete with stunning musical numbers, excellent choreography, ample humor, gorgeous cinematography, an inspired production design and superb performances by the four principals, all of whom are certain to be strong awards season candidates (quite a recommendation coming from someone who unapologetically makes no claim to being a fan of musicals). More than that, though, “Wicked” is an insightful treatise on the quest for power and learning how to make judicious use of it, both in personal dealings and in matters of wider consequence, a fitting cautionary tale for our times (or any time, for that matter). If I had any complaint here, it would be my concern that this is yet another example of a story that’s been divided up into two installments, a growing trend that I don’t believe will ultimately serve the movie industry well. According to the director, this was seen as a necessary step to do justice to the source material, given that it would have been nearly impossible to cram everything into one picture without doing major damage to the content. And, to give the filmmaker the benefit of the doubt, perhaps that will ultimately prove true with the release of part 2 in 2025 (but I’ll reserve judgment on that for the time being). In the meantime, though, this first part comes through as promised, and, in this day and age, that’s a cinematic miracle in itself.",2024-11-24T18:12:35.279Z,402431,4 stars,0.6277111172676086
r96sk,8.0,"Very good! I enjoyed <em>'Wicked'</em>.

Always impressive when a long run time flashes by - no doubt a sign of a sturdy movie. 2hr 40mins is how long this one lasts, I thought I might have felt that whilst watching but, honestly, I didn't. Since sharing my reviews online I have appreciated musicals much more, to the point that when I learn a film is from this genre it barely registers.

I have never seen the stage musical, in fact the only detail I knew for certain was that it was from the world of <em>'The Wizard of Oz'</em> - which, in turn, I only know from the 1939 and 2013 movies, as well as one or two other flicks. As such, I wasn't actually sure where they were heading with the Wicked Witch of the West - but I approve.

Cynthia Erivo impresses as the aforementioned. I have to say, mind, that Ariana Grande is the person onscreen that stood out most. She does an excellent job at making her character's self-centered quirks so convincing, while also producing a few amusing moments too. Jonathan Bailey and Peter Dinklage are good, while Jeff Goldblum certainly fits his role.

The ending, whilst perfectly fine and pleasing, is possibly a bit rushed/abrupt, though that's to be expected given it's only part one. The same can be said for most films that are split into multiple productions, to be fair. I am intrigued to see where part two goes, bring on this time next year.

The music is, as one would expect, also a positive. Granted I don't think I'll be adding any of the tracks to my playlist, but I still had a pleasant time hearing all the songs come and go - not one sticks out like a sore thumb, so that's good. Elsewhere, visually and plot-wise I have no real complaints.",2024-11-26T19:39:43.013Z,402431,4 stars,0.8657943606376648

Broadway hits rely on a suspension of disbelief. With the right ingredients, even the oddest of ideas can take flight on stage… but in the delicate translation to screen, they crash-land. Take Cats: something about that core premise of humans playing felines – which theatre audiences lapped up (sorry) for decades – just didn’t work at the movies.

From the outside, it’s easy to paint Wicked with the same brush. Isn’t it all a bit… silly? There’s a blonde Godiva who floats in a bubble. A green woman who was raised by a bear (and whose father may or may not be a wizard). And when they meet at a Hogwarts-style university, we find out their professor, Dr. Dillamond, is a talking goat. These aren’t exactly the trappings of a thoughtful, award-winning piece of drama. But peel back the colours of any GOOD fantasy and you’ll usually find the allegories are rich and meaningful. With its themes of parental guilt, absent fatherhood, disability, discrimination and class supremacy, Wicked is no exception.

Look, we’re not saying Wicked’s perfect. At 2 hours 40 minutes, it’s knocking HARD on the “too long, wrap it up!” door. And there’s characters that either overdo it a bit (Governor Thropp) or arguably, don’t add much at all (oh Pfannee, do you even go to this school?).

But that’s a bit like complaining about a scratch on a speedboat. A sleek, wondrous craft that can whiz you somewhere thrilling, and change you along the way. We didn’t have crazy high expectations – hey, the everyday moviegoer isn’t a hardcore Broadway fan – but honestly? You don’t need to be. Wicked is a movie for anyone. And maybe that’s why it feels so GOOD.",2024-11-28T07:35:14.126Z,402431,2 stars,0.33514487743377686

rssp55,8.0,"I so wanted to hate it.

I didn't like the decision to split the musical into two films. I didn't like the casting. I HATED the trailer, where it made the film look like it was baked with plastic, glossy CGI, or even worse Gen-AI.

And I was wrong.

Erivo and Grande are stellar. The co-stars aren't who I'd have picked, but they're quite excellent themselves. (Particularly the folks playing Bok and Nessa.) 

It's a glorious, beautiful, and joyful film in many ways. When Elphaba finally soars, my heart soared as well and I found myself tearing up. 

I also appreciated how it gives a nod to the much, much darker book, especially with the propaganda posters and effigy in the opening, and the various references to Oz's takeover. (Like when the stone edifice falls off the side of the school building revealing the animals beneath.)

My only complaint is, as with any two or three-parter, lots of the filler is garbage. This is especially true  of the Dancing Through Life number, which becomes unbearably long and significantly less magical because of the added content. 

Still, highly recommended. 8/10 Stars.",2024-12-31T20:13:20.305Z,402431,4 stars,0.7545433044433594
RalphRahal,7.0,"Wicked by Jon M. Chu is an ambitious adaptation that largely delivers on its promise to bring the magic of the beloved musical to the big screen. Visually, the movie is stunning, with vibrant set pieces and a cinematic take on Oz that feels both familiar and fresh. Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba brings an emotional depth that truly captures the character’s struggles, while Ariana Grande’s Glinda adds a balance of charm and humor. Together, their performances anchor the film and make the story’s core themes, friendship, identity, and societal perception, shine.

The musical numbers are undeniably the movie’s highlight. Songs like ""Defying Gravity"" are powerful and beautifully staged, though I couldn’t help but feel the choreography, while good, could have been taken a step further to truly elevate the experience. The pacing is a mixed bag, with the first act taking its time to set the stage, which may feel slow for some. That said, once the story finds its rhythm, it balances the emotional beats with grandeur fairly well, though the shifts in tone could have been smoothed out more.

Overall, Wicked succeeds as a visually impressive and emotionally resonant adaptation, even if it stumbles in a few places. It’s a solid film for fans of the musical and newcomers alike. While there’s room for improvement, particularly in pacing and choreography, it’s hard to deny that the performances and visual storytelling make it a worthwhile watch.",2025-01-09T00:08:35.751Z,402431,4 stars,0.7738972902297974

Ridley Scott once again showcases his mastery in blending narrative, action, and thematic depth, delivering a sequel marked by superb technical execution and standout performances, particularly from Denzel Washington. Despite the inevitable comparisons to the classic, the iconic filmmaker presents a story that justifies its existence, even if it treads familiar ground.

griggs79,8.0,"_Gladiator II_, a polished echo of the original, is a testament to Ridley Scott's cinematic powers. It follows his hit-and-miss _Napoleon_ biopic last year, which was rather miss than hit. The sequel captures the original's essence while introducing elements, making it a worthy successor.

Paul Mescal in the lead role - inherited from the ever-growling Russel Crowe, who was at the top of his career in the original - holds his ground against Denzel Washington, whose charisma cleaves through the screen as effortlessly as his character's sword.

Ridley Scott admits he was prompted to revisit _Gladiator_ by the acclaim he received from those too young to have seen the original on the big screen. His mission to lure Gen Z away from their streaming devices may help to save cinema, ushering in a new era of appreciation for the big screen. But for the love of Jupiter, I hope they quickly learn that it isn't just a big iPad with comfy chairs. No pausing, swiping, mid-film selfies, dashes to the bar, or running commentary required. Screen four at your local cinema isn't the Colosseum but a place where the magic of film of this scale truly comes alive, offering a unique and immersive experience that can't be replicated at home.",2024-11-15T10:44:36.828Z,558449,4 stars,0.6972863674163818
r96sk,9.0,"<em>'Gladiator II'</em> is awesome!

I only watched the original three years ago, almost to the day in fact, but I was anticipating this follow-up after thoroughly loving the Russell Crowe film. Honestly, I think I kinda enjoyed this sequel more - at worst, the two are on the same level, for me anyway. Crowe is missed, though everyone in this movie more than makes up for his (obvious) absence.

This is the first time I've seen Paul Mescal act, despite knowing of him for quite a while now. I'm impressed! He delivers a showing of great strength (pardon the pun). Pedro Pascal is very good too, as is Joseph Quinn; I wasn't instantly sold on the latter when he appeared onscreen, though when all is said and done I rate his performance positively.

Denzel Washington... what a geezer. I'll never tire or turn down the chance at seeing that man act. Needless to say, given he's one of two favourite actors of mine, I loved his performance all the way through. The likes of Fred Hechinger and Connie Nielsen merit fair praise as well, interesting to see Rory McCann and Matt Lucas in there too.

Oh, and the score... superb! Deafeningly grand.",2024-11-15T19:15:28.384Z,558449,5 stars,0.4812690317630768
CinemaSerf,6.0,"Sixteen years after ""Maximus"" (Russell Crowe) bit the dust, we find ancient Rome under the control of twins ""Geta"" (Joseph Quinn) and his brother ""Caracalla"" (Fred Hechinger) and thanks to their general ""Acacias"" (Pedro Pascal) continuing to expand their empire. It's this latter man who leads an attack on the home ""Nanno"" (Paul Mescal) shares with his wife ""Arishat"" (Yuval Gonen). That doesn't go so well and next thing, she's gone on ahead of him to the wheat fields and he's now a slave owned by the manipulative ""Macrinus"" (Denzel Washington) heading to the Colosseum to entertain the emperors and their cousin ""Lucilla"" (Connie Nielsen). What now ensues is a well produced and good looking rehash of the first film paying homage en route to ""Spartacus"" and it's the sheer predicability that I struggled with. It's episodically delivered with far too much script and though Mescal tries hard, his performance is largely charm-free and as wooden as a rudius, especially once the rather far-fetched familial back-story has been established. Sir Derek Jacobi sparingly appears as the other survivor from 2000 reprising his role as the senator ""Gracchus"" but to no real effect and the scene stealer for me is really only the megalomanic Quinn's imperial offering as he and his bonkers sibling teeter on the brink of inbred, sexually fluid, madness. Washington does well enough as the scheming slave-master, but he hasn't really enough to work with to stand out amongst what really are a mediocre collection of undercooked characters that just don't deliver any real sense of the hedonism and menace of this debauched and corrupt state. As with Sir Ridley Scott's ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (2005) the battle scenes are superb and action packed, as are the combat scenes in the vast marble auditorium filled with baying plebs and rhinos, but I am afraid that the shallow characterisations just didn't work well enough to keep this engaging and the plot was just too thin to stretch over a couple of hours that could have been so very much better. It really does need a big screen to appreciate the creatively crafted visuals, but I was still pretty disappointed, sorry.",2024-11-16T08:14:36.854Z,558449,3 stars,0.4915819466114044

Chris Sawin,5.0,"Gladiator II features some impressive action sequences. Every battle in the Colosseum is fantastic despite how historically inaccurate they may be. The monkey sequence showcases how skilled Hanno (Paul Mescal) is not only as a fighter but also in how he interacts with others. Then there's the rhino sequence that plays out much like Bugs Bunny’s interactions with Toro the Bull in the Chuck Jones-directed Looney Tunes short Bully for Bugs (1953).

While those sequences are fairly believable, the shark sequence seems like pure fantasy and that’s why it’s so incredible. They fill the Colosseum with water and let sharks loose while the opposing gladiators try to survive the onslaught on boats.

It’s also interesting to note that every major actor who dies in the film has a spectacular death. Not only that but these gruesome deaths get increasingly more grisly and memorable as the film progresses. These bloody triumphs rarely delve any deeper than someone getting shot with a bunch of arrows or a beheading or appendage severing of some kind. This level of brutality escalates throughout the film and eventually culminates with the most satisfying kill that takes two and a half hours to achieve.

The performances fluctuate between being top-tier perfection and mediocre overacting. Denzel Washington is having the time of his life as Macrinus. He has the most interesting storyline and Denzel dances in every scene with a giddiness that is unparalleled. Joseph Quinn seems to be acting in an entirely different film than everyone else as Emperor Geta. His mannerisms are operatic and theatrical with his wide eyes that rarely blink, grand body language and hand gestures, and explosive line delivery.

Pedro Pascal doesn’t do anything in Gladiator II as Marcus Acacius that he didn’t do in Game of Thrones apart from having more screen time. Much like how his character is written, Paul Mescal’s performance is muddled. The Hanno character and who he is is a poorly kept secret that consistently pulls the character in several directions.

Hanno is vengeful at first before succumbing to being the hero of the film and the evolution isn’t earned. The writing and pacing of Gladiator II feel like the film drops Hanno’s fate in his lap halfway through, which he’s either forgotten about over two decades or never knew until the audience did.

Connie Nielsen, one of the few returning actors from the original film, is awful in this. Her acting in Gladiator II always comes off as forced as her crying scenes are often portrayed as constipated grunts with crocodile tears. Her dialogue delivery is also strained and broken despite being given some of the most important sequences of character connections and reawakenings of sorts in the sequel.

Calling Gladiator II action-heavy is misleading because the film drags between every fight sequence. The film is largely dull and difficult to indulge during its quieter moments. The film is gorgeous with its incredible set pieces, intricate costume design, and impressive use of infinitely numerous extras. Director Ridley Scott reunites with all of the set decorators (Sonja Klaus, Crispian Sallis, and Emilio Ardura) and costume designer (Janty Yates) that he worked with on Gladiator in 2000. From a visual standpoint, Ridley Scott's films are highly detailed masterpieces.

Denzel Washington’s extravagant performance makes Gladiator II worthwhile. Still, not even its excessively violent action sequences, beautiful cinematography, and masterful set and costume design can save the sequel from how boring it is. Ridley Scott waited over twenty years to make a sequel that is more than twice as expensive as the original only to rehash the same story points.",2024-11-20T01:01:33.492Z,558449,4 stars,0.4920315146446228

RalphRahal,5.0,"When Ridley Scott decided to revisit Gladiator, it sounded like an opportunity to expand on one of the greatest historical epics. Instead, we got a rehash that feels more like a missed opportunity than a bold sequel.

The first act rushes through familiar territory. A general, born out of combat, loses his family and ends up as a slave. Sound familiar? It’s the same setup as Maximus’s story, minus the emotional weight. And sending Lucilla’s son away to protect him? That’s not just a weak plot point, it spits on everything Maximus and Marcus died for.

The second act brings nothing new to the table. The “twist” is predictable, the plot messy, and the villains uninspired. Commodus worked because he was layered, a mix of insecurity and cruelty. Here, the two emperors are generic placeholders. Even the attempted coup feels like déjà vu, with none of the intensity or buildup that made the first movie iconic.

The third act delivers a visually stunning battle but lacks substance. The final showdown offers nothing fresh, and the death of the antagonist in front of everyone feels like it’s trying to copy the original. The speech about “Maximus and Marcus’s dream”? We’ve heard it before, and it meant more the first time.

What was the point of that last scene? There were so many ways to end this movie with a high note, something meaningful to honor Lucilla or Acacius. Instead, we get a hollow, pointless ending that adds nothing to the story.

Credit where it’s due: the cinematography, CGI, and score are outstanding. Visually, the movie is a masterpiece, with breathtaking scenery and polished editing. The music, while clearly inspired by the original, carries the mood well. But great visuals can’t save a story that refuses to move forward.

It's a fun adventure this one but it is a bit slow, the humour isn't so plentiful and the plot is a little derivative with not enough bear and too much of ""Jungle Cruise"" (2021) meets ""Sound of Music"" (1965) to it. I thought Banderas and Colman rather hammed it all up a bit and there also wasn't quite the cosiness of the family-led escapades with much less opportunity for Dame Julie Walters to get actively involved. The narrative is all just a bit disjointed without the charm of the two earlier cinema outings for Michael Bond's character.

Chris Sawin,8.0,"Paddington in Peru is the first of the trilogy not written and directed by Paul King. King chose not to return and moved on to Wonka instead, but he pitched the idea for the third Paddington film and executive produces. Emily Mortimer also replaces Sally Hawkins as Mrs. Brown while Mr. Curry (Peter Capaldi) doesn’t appear at all.

Paddington receives a letter from The Reverend Mother (Olivia Colman) at the home for retired bears that his Aunt Lucy is acting differently and misses him terribly. He makes his way to Peru with the Browns only to discover that Aunt Lucy has gone missing. Now he must endure uncharted territory in the jungles of Peru if he ever wishes to see her again.

Meanwhile, the home of the Brown family has changed drastically. Judy (Madeleine Harris) spends her time recording travel vlogs and choosing where she intends to go to college. At the same time, Jonathan (Samuel Joslin) is an inventor who uses his gadgets to assist in his video game-playing laziness.

Mary (Mortimer) is already feeling the wrath of empty nest syndrome. At the same time, Henry (Hugh Bonneville) stresses over whether or not he can adapt to the action-oriented demeanor of his new boss. The trip to Peru is seen as one last vacation as a family before everything changes for good.  

Once in Peru, Paddington discovers a clue that seems to point to Aunt Lucy making her way to a place called Rumi Rock. But Paddington and the Browns will need a boat to get there. Enter Hunter Cabot (Antonio Banderas) and his daughter Gina (Carla Tous).

The humor in Paddington in Peru feels like it’s been amped up a bit in comparison to the previous two films. Most of the humor is still physical comedy and is a result of Paddington being clumsy or not understanding his surroundings. But the film makes it a point to showcase the fact that something is fishy with Olivia Colman’s Reverend Mother from the start. It becomes the film’s longest-running gag.

Hunter Cabot is haunted by the ghosts of his ancestors. The Cabot bloodline is a greedy bunch and unfortunately, that trait plagues Hunter despite his best efforts. He tries to live by the fact that his daughter is his biggest treasure, but the temptation has always been there and Paddington reawakens something awful in him.

Antonio Banderas is essentially Burger Beard from The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water as Hunter Cabot, but with more depth. Banderas portrays five or six different Cabot ancestors including a woman. He is silly and goofy, but he’s also one of the film’s biggest antagonists.

With a screenplay by Mark Burton (Paddington 2, Early Man), Jon Foster, and James Lamont (both Foster and Lamont worked on the 2019 CGI animated TV series The Adventures of Paddington) with a screen story by Paul King (director of Paddington 1 & 2), Simon Farnaby (co-writer on all three Paddington films), and Mark Burton, Paddington in Peru can be watched as a standalone adventure or as a third film in a trilogy.

There are throwbacks to the previous films (the hard stare, the mid-credits scene being a homage to Paddington’s prison friends, etc), but it doesn’t take away or add anything per se to the main story Paddington in Peru is trying to tell. Someone could start with this film and enjoy it for what it is before seeing the first two films.

Paddington in Peru goes in predictable directions, but the film plays off those expectations masterfully. You know where the story is going to go from the start, but when those big moments come you are still invested and you still cry. The Paddington films have never shied away from embodying what heartfelt and touchy-feely truly mean. If your heartstrings are ever in need of a tune-up, a Paddington film will get them humming like new guaranteed.

The Paddington films have always embodied an unparalleled sense of wonder and happiness; being content with the smallest things. Paddington in Peru is no different, but there’s an even bigger emphasis on how big the world is outside of our comfort zone and kindness above all else.  Paddington in Peru is a heartwarming film about embracing your inner bear and discovering how precious home is.",2025-02-14T00:25:44.895Z,516729,4 stars,0.5171575546264648
drfacetious,7.0,"A worthy addition to a fantastic series.

A fairly notable departure from the previous installments under Dougal Wilson's direction, but in a way that handily manages to avoid feeling unwelcome. As other reviews have noted, some of the charm of the London-based Paddington adventures is lost, and there is an ambitious venture into a zanier style of humour, but this lands far more often than not. Sally Hawkins is much missed, and it feels that the character of Mary was down-written a bit in response, denying Emily Mortimer the opportunity to make the role her own, a little unfairly. Meanwhile Olivia Colman provides one of the best characters of the whole series as The Reverend Mother in a genuinely hilarious performance highlighting her ridiculous range. A special mention has to go to the visual design, which runs the gamut from impeccable sets, to studied cinematography, to fun cartoony animated effects, to jawdroppingly beautiful sequences that appear hand-painted. I was prepared to go home disappointed, but Paddington in Peru makes it 3 for 3.",2025-03-05T07:26:33.634Z,516729,3 stars,0.6043689250946045
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,8.0,"As a childhood fan of the blue-coated, red hat wearing, marmalade-loving bear, it certainly wasn’t difficult to be charmed by “Paddington in Peru,” an absolute joy of a movie from director Dougal Wilson. Delivering another heartwarming and adventurous tale, this third installment in the series takes the lovable protagonist and the Brown family on an exciting journey deep into the Amazon. The result is a family-friendly romp that blends humor, mystery, and plenty of heart.

When Paddington (voice of Ben Whishaw) receives word that his dear Aunt Lucy (voice of Imelda Staunton) has gone missing from the Home for Retired Bears, he rushes to Peru to try and find her. Not wanting to set out on a whirlwind adventure alone, he travels with the Brown family (Hugh Bonneville, Emily Mortimer, Samuel Joslin, Madeleine Harris) and Mrs. Bird (Julie Walters) in tow. When they arrive, the nun in charge (Olivia Colman) seems a little “off,” especially after learning that the visitors have hired a mysterious boat captain (Antonio Banderas) to navigate the jungle. A quest to find Aunt Lucy quickly transforms into an extraordinary adventure, leading Paddington to uncover numerous secrets about his original family.

The film is wholesome and has something for everyone (it’s rated PG for some mildly intense moments), and it’s impossible not to be charmed by its core themes of family, love, perseverance, and always seeing the best in people. Paddington’s kind-hearted nature and unwavering optimism make him a delight to watch. He’s a terrific role model for kids and adults alike, although his innocence sometimes leads to trouble. As always, the brave little bear’s courage and belief in the goodness of others ultimately help him navigate challenges (and often save the day in the most adorable ways possible).

The Browns are portrayed as the most supportive of families, with Mrs. Brown fretting about her eldest heading off to college and Mr. Brown feeling stressed about his new boss at work and her “embrace the risk” philosophy. Their busy lives mean they haven’t been spending as much time together, and the adventure through Peru brings them closer.

The adventure itself has enough excitement to keep children and their parents entertained, especially with the highly enjoyable supporting turns from Banderas and Colman. They both seem to have a lot of fun with their roles, which translates into a good time for viewers. The film balance whimsical fantasy with real stakes, especially with some of the characters motivated by greed and the promise of finding hidden treasure. Paddington, of course, remains steadfast in his values, offering a strong moral compass throughout the journey.
 
There are lots of funny jokes and sight gags too, even if the finale does lean a bit too far into silliness. However, the sheer warmth, humor, and heart of the movie more than make up for it, especially the beautiful reminder that a home is where you make it. “Paddington in Peru” is a delightful, smart, and adventurous family film packed with humor, charm, and important messages about love and perseverance. This one’s a winner.

MovieGuys,6.0,"Elevation reminds a little of the computer game Horizon Zero Dawn. 

The notion of artificial creatures, akin to animals, that stalk and kill humans is central to the game and this film. That said, this is where the similarities, largely end. 

In essence this is an apocalyptic, alien invasion by proxy story. Its pacing is decent but it does feel like its just one of the crowd. Nothing especially unique, intriguing or overly novel is going on here. 

Acting is convincing, its a strong cast of well known faces, characterisations are a bit predictable but nothing really awful, either. 

A comment does need to be made about the special effects, which really are, well done.

In summary an inherently watchable but also rather pedestrian sci fi, end of the world, adventure. Worth a look if, like me, you enjoy this kind of thing.",2024-12-05T07:01:38.862Z,1035048,3 stars,0.48953506350517273
Brent Marchant,7.0,"Finding ourselves, particularly the process of finding what we’ve lost about ourselves, can be an eye-opening, enlightening but sometimes-painful ordeal, especially if we’re unclear about where to look. For many of us, though, this is a challenge we often attempt to resolve by examining our past, specifically that of our family and its legacy, in hopes that it provides the answers we seek. Such is the quest embarked upon by two once-close cousins, David (Jesse Eisenberg) and Benji (Kieran Culkin), who journey to Poland on an intimate heritage tour to visit the homestead of their beloved deceased grandmother, a Holocaust survivor who made her way to America after World War II. While David and Benji were at one time as thick as thieves, they’ve drifted apart over time, each becoming significantly different from one another, but they hope to reestablish their longstanding connection through this intensely personal pilgrimage. As their odyssey unfolds, though, they come face to face with the changes that have arisen both in their relationship and in their understandings of themselves, from life goals to their cultural background as the descendants of Polish Jews to how they fundamentally relate to the world. It’s an often-difficult process for these earnest seekers, especially in light of their discovery that, if they truly wish to better understand themselves, they can only go so far in looking outward, instead needing to look inward for guidance and meaningful insight. And its aptly selected title is an ably suitable metaphor on multiple levels, not only in describing Benji’s often-manic, irrational and unpredictable behavior, but also in characterizing the anguish that he and David undergo in making their way through this emotional minefield. This second feature effort from actor-writer-director Eisenberg is indeed an impressive offering, even if its road trip/buddy movie script could use some periodic tweaking in terms of focus and its balance between comedy and drama. More significantly, however, this is a breakout performance for Culkin, who shows just how adept he can be with the right material, an award-worthy portrayal, to be sure. Add to this the film’s gorgeous cinematography of Polish landmarks and the country’s landscapes, as well as its fittingly appropriate Frédéric Chopin soundtrack, and you’ve got a profoundly thoughtful release, one that should give anyone in the cousins’ shoes pause for reflection, something from which we can all benefit from time to time, no matter what we’re ultimately looking for.",2024-11-16T05:57:22.622Z,1013850,4 stars,0.6859793066978455
Chris Sawin,7.0,"Written and directed by Jesse Eisenberg, A Real Pain sees two cousins reunite after a long period. David (Eisenberg) and Benji (Kieran Culkin) were raised together and were around each other so much growing up that they were brothers. They meet up in the present day for a Poland Holocaust tour that culminates with them visiting the house that once belonged to their grandmother.  

David and Benji are at two different stages of life despite being a few months apart. David has a full-time job, a wife, and a kid while Benji is single and doesn’t have a job. While David has fond memories of their grandmother, she was Benji’s favorite person in the world and her death took a huge toll on him that he still hasn’t gotten over.

The two estranged cousins are complete opposites of one another. David plays it safe and is typically very quiet while adhering to the rules that are laid out before him. Benji is outspoken, charming, and doesn’t care what people think. People always know how he feels, which isn’t always a good thing since his moods change on a whim.

The performances are interesting because Jesse Eisenberg has always had this kind of neurotic demeanor about him as an actor (talks fast with few pauses, is anxious around other people, totally awkward). Leave it to a film that he writes, directs, and stars in for him to play the more grounded of the two main characters.

When Benji’s unusual behavior becomes unbearable, David cracks under the pressure of trying to hold it together and be the more level-headed of the two. Eisenberg portrays frustration, anger, sadness, and love in a way that is relatable and believable.

Kieran Culkin steals nearly every scene he’s in as Benji. As a character, Benji has a way of being the center of attention without really trying. He speaks his mind and does what he wants. He doesn’t care if he comes as rude or down to earth or like an asshole. He is effortlessly charismatic and funny with a ton of potential to be more than he is. But he’s also broken and the entire tour group can see that. Like Benji wears on David, he can be overbearing at times to the audience but that also makes the character feel that much more genuine.

There’s a fine line between paying respect and being blasphemous in A Real Pain. David doesn’t want to be disrespectful in any way while Benji makes his decision based on how he feels. For example, posing dramatically and humorously in front of a monument honoring those who gave their lives during the war could be seen as therapeutic or shameful. Later in the film, the tour group doesn’t see an issue traveling in a first-class train car while Benji is immensely offended since Jews were forced to ride in the very back of the train.

The film is written in a way that reveals a bit more behind each cousin as the film progresses. What begins as two cousins traveling to Poland and paying respect to their grandmother evolves into David worrying whether or not Benji can survive on his own while Benji is upset that he doesn’t hear from David much anymore because he’s a family man with a career. They’re two different sides of the same coin: one cousin is taking life too seriously while the other doesn’t take it seriously enough.

And as a neutral party watching this all unfold, you can see the benefits and shortcomings of both sides. Being married, having a child, and having a full-time job takes up all your free time. On the other hand, not having a job leaves you with more time to feel like no one has time for you anymore. Both cousins are at an impasse and maybe that’s the takeaway from A Real Pain: to make do and appreciate what you’ve got.

And the film ends in a way that doesn’t resolve anything. As adults, we age, get invested in our careers, and drift away from friends and family who were once close because of our commitments as responsible people. A Real Pain touches on that concept.

The more we want things to change and the more we want our loved ones to be safe and happy there’s only so much we can do before we go back to our regularly scheduled and separate lives. We just have to hope that that bond and nostalgia that we share is enough until we’re able to meet again. Just because you reach out doesn’t mean things will get better. It lets that loved one know you care and sometimes that’s enough.

A Real Pain capitalizes on the ups and downs of traveling with a family member. You love them and have a deep connection with them, but they also annoy you to no end and are reminded why you don’t see them more often.

Jesse Eisenberg has made a film that is emotionally powerful and unbelievably relatable while Kieran Culkin delivers an exhaustingly mesmerizing performance loaded with depth and relentless magnetism. The way the film revolves around such flawed individuals makes them feel grounded in reality and A Real Pain feels like bona fide cinema because of it.",2024-11-20T01:41:59.527Z,1013850,4 stars,0.3816922605037689

CinemaSerf,7.0,"""Grandma Dory"" has passed away and left her two grandsons some money so that they can take a trip to Poland and see where she grew up amidst the Nazi invasion and subsequent holocaust. These two are cousins. ""David"" (Jesse Eisenberg) is a bit of a shy, geeky, type who lives in New York with his wife and child. ""Banji"" (Kieran Culkin) is quite the opposite. A free spirited, thinking and speaking individual who cares little for what anyone else thinks about him. The pair clearly love each other, but the behaviour of the latter continues to rattle his travelling companion, especially when they meet up with the other members of their touring party in Warsaw. What now ensues is quite a testament to both Eisenberg's vision as a writer/director but also to the inspired casting of Culkin. He is the kind of holiday companion I'd cheerfully have killed with a rusty harpoon. Loud, brash, opinionated and sometimes borderline cruel as he imposes himself on the group swearing as he goes. Gradually, though, we discover that both men have shields up; both are dealing with some fairly deep psychological issues in their own way and even ought these may clash, there is still far more fundamentally connecting them that not. There are ample opportunities to see the sights of Warsaw, and there is an haunting few minutes at the Majdanek camp where shoes, thousands and thousands of shoes, make you shiver. It's potent and it's often funny, darkly so, and in many ways it slots nicely into the recent panoply of dramas about the fascination by younger generations in the horror of war that those who endured actually want to get past and forget. It also shines a light on the whole business of tourism around these monuments, and does make it quite clear that sometimes these trips can become a statistical box-ticking exercise, especially for Americans, who want to say they've ""done"" that. An architectural monument equivalent of a safari ""big five"". In the end I found ""Benji"" to be a vulnerable but fundamentally selfish and unlikeable character - but I bet there are many reading this who profoundly disagree. That's proof that these two did their job well and I'd recommend you go see it in a cinema for a couple of powerful and characterful performances.",2025-01-09T08:35:09.753Z,1013850,4 stars,0.5786864161491394
r96sk,7.0,"<em>'A Real Pain'</em> is a real solid watch. It makes up for its no-frills with plenty of heart and a meaningful buddy road trip. It's described as a comedy-drama and it is, though I'd say it's more the latter than the former; albeit with a still sizeable dose of comedy, it is amusing.

Kieran Culkin is the reason for the aforementioned, he is the star of this particular show and is funny throughout - though when he has to play more serious, he does to very good effect. Jesse Eisenberg (also dir.) acts alongside, he plays his character really well too. Two strong performers! Will Sharpe and Kurt Egyiawan are good too.

I remember seeing part of the trailer and thought it had <em>'Planes, Trains and Automobiles'</em> vibes, I guess there are naturally tiny shades of that but it is very much its own thing. I definitely enjoyed watching it unfold.",2025-01-09T23:42:31.315Z,1013850,4 stars,0.6881877183914185
CinemaSerf,7.0,"I suppose that many of us have had the god-squad on the doorstep trying to peddle their philosophising but I doubt many are quite as prepared, or as tempting, as the butter-wouldn't-melt ""Reed"" (Hugh Grant) when the enthusiastic sisters ""Barnes"" (Sophie Thatcher) and ""Paxton"" (Chloe East) arrive at his door. Promises of a meeting with his wife and some blueberry pie lure them in and soon they are having a meaningful debate that rather puts the girls on edge. That anxiety only gets worse as there's no sign of the wife and the scented candle proves to have a most unusual, and illuminating, aroma. They conclude that getting out of his home is the best plan, but that isn't going to be straightforward. He has other plans, and they are going to have to play a game of belief/disbelief if they are to have any hope of getting back to their church. The horror aspects of this are not especially interesting - it's a sort of competent hybrid of ""Escape Room"" meets ""Cluedo"". What helps this stand out a bit more is a subtly menacing effort from Grant and the standard of the writing. The conversation between the three for the first half of the film is quite thought provoking in itself. It asks questions that are truly valid and worthy of consideration amongst those of or without organised faith. The assertions around ""iterations"", burgers and games of ""Monopoly"" also raise a few solid questions about carts and horses that I rather appreciated as we are invited to question or evaluate the whole scope of monotheistic religions and their role in our lives. The two women gel well together here too, realising that they are in some sort of peril - both intellectual and physical, and that latter threat is well demonstrated by some creepy settings and creatively used audio. I didn't love the conclusion - I actually found it really quite disappointing, as if Scott Beck had just run out of ideas or didn't quite have the courage of his earlier convictions, but this is the most substantial part I've seen Grant play in a while and he holds it together well. Not your typical psychological drama and worth a watch, I'd say.",2024-11-03T20:21:48.556Z,1138194,3 stars,0.5262320041656494

garethmb,-1.0,"In the new film “Heretic”, two missionaries named Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher) and Sister Paxton (Chloe East) spend their days in fellowship and looking to bring new members into their faith. Sister Paxton is the more sheltered of the two as Sister Barnes comes from the East Coast and joined the church through conversion and appears much wiser in the ways of the world to her colleague.

Eager to get her first new member for Sister Paxton; the two venture to visit Mr. Reed (Hugh Grant), who had earlier expressed interest in their church and as such; made his way onto the contact list for the girls.

A storm arrives at the same time the girls do but unable to enter the home of Mr. Reed without a female being present; they are assured that his wife is baking in the kitchen and accept his offer to come in out of the weather.

They find Mr. Reed charming and very well-versed in theology as he says that he has been studying religions for over a decade and his knowledge is very impressive to the girls yet his questions, answers, and tone start to become disturbing to the girls as does the absence of his wife whom he claims is just in the other room.

Looking for a chance to leave, the girls discover that they are locked in and the house has a metal overlay that blocks their cell signals. Further complicating matters is the increasingly odd behavior of Mr. Reed who insists that they are free to leave at any time yet confronts them with all manner of theological questions, theories, and challenges at every turn.

What follows is a chilling exercise in faith for the girls in a gripping film that keeps you guessing all along.

The cast is solid and Grant is very good playing against type. This is not the usual psycho slasher that audiences often see in films of this type but a deep psychological game of terror and manipulation as he believes that he is helping the girls see the truth amongst all the dogma.

The film does play a bit to Hollywood for my taste in the final act as certain revelations and outcomes went away from the clever premise that had been established in favor of more traditional situations, but the vast majority of the film was chilling, engaging, and captivating and was powered by strong performances all around.

Directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods who also wrote the film; are no strangers to Horror and Suspense as their resumes are filled with some very tense films and have crafted a film that works as an intense thriller.

Brent Marchant,2.0,"No matter what anyone might say, putting lipstick on a pig doesn’t change the fact that one is still dealing with a pig. And that’s very much the case with this dismally failed attempt at smart horror from writer-directors Scott Beck and Bryan Woods. When two naïve Mormon missionaries (Sophie Thatcher, Chloe East) visit the remote home of a creepy, loquacious middle-aged loner (Hugh Grant) in an attempt to convert him, the trio launches into a protracted conversation about the nature of “the one true religion.” To a certain extent, it’s an intriguing philosophical discussion – at least for a while – until it gradually descends into a series of longwinded fits and starts characterized by disjointed, unrelated, unresolved segments that try viewer patience. The dialogue increasingly amounts to a series of overwrought contrivances undermined by implausible character development, particularly among the two supposed innocents who begin spouting lines that are difficult to accept in light of their supposedly gullible, unsophisticated nature and narrow worldview. But then, in a desperate attempt to retain fading audience attention, the picture degenerates into little more than a meandering slasher movie, albeit with better production design than one typically finds in such fare. What’s more, this offering’s exasperating script heavily “borrows” from an endless stream of religious, philosophical and cinematic sources, one even suggesting that this could turn into the second coming of “The Butterfly Effect” and “Matrix” franchises. And, while Grant and his co-stars genuinely deliver more than capable portrayals of the three principals, even their performances aren’t enough to cover the inherent weaknesses of this material, no matter how much lipstick is applied to it. Considering the foregoing, I’m truly mystified by the much-celebrated response this offering has been accorded given its tiresome narrative and pretentious, largely pointless overall direction, an experiment that just doesn’t work. As a fan of the smart horror genre and its aim of elevating the content of more classic releases in this area of cinema, I’m seriously disappointed that the inspired creators of “A Quiet Place” (2018) haven’t come up with something better here, an outcome that’s definitely heretical in itself.",2024-11-09T15:04:27.460Z,1138194,2 stars,0.5988010764122009
Chris Sawin,5.0,"Written and directed by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods (65, Haunt, writers of A Quiet Place), Heretic is a so-called psychological horror that is disappointing on all fronts. After only seeing the trailer once months ago, I initially thought that Heretic was a film about a serial killer (Hugh Grant) who used his crazy mouse trap-contraption house to lure in religious, door-to-door service people and kill them.

While that is partially the case, Heretic follows two missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Sister Barnes (Sophie Thatcher, The Book of Boba Fett) and Sister Paxton (Chloe East, The Wolf of Snow Hollow). The two women go to the house of Mr. Reed (Grant) who has expressed interest in hearing more about their religion.

As Sister Barnes and Sister Paxton make their way inside, they soon find themselves trapped in Mr. Reed’s bizarrely intricate home featuring electricity on a timer, a front door that supposedly won’t open again until morning, and that the house being made of metal blocks cell phone signals. 

Reed, a theology major with vast knowledge of all religions, claims to have found the one true religion. Whether the two women will escape or if Reed knows what he’s talking about is factors into the cerebral aspect of the film.

Martin Freeman constantly looked miserable and bored out of his mind when he appeared in films like The Hobbit trilogy or the Sherlock TV series. He suddenly looked like he was having the time of his life when he shifted film genres, plunged into horror, and starred in the 2017 film Ghost Stories.

It seems to be the same case for Hugh Grant. While this isn’t his first horror film, Heretic is his first film in the genre in 36 years (Grant starred in The Lair of the White Room in 1988). Grant is noticeably lively in his performance in Heretic though and seems downright giddy to be torturing people.

With cinematography by Chung Chung-hoon (Last Night in Soho, The Handmaiden), Heretic has two visually memorable sequences thanks to how they’re shot. When Sister Barnes and Sister Paxton first arrive, Mr. Reed leaves the room to check on his “wife.” While he’s gone, Barnes turns the candle he blew out and discovers what the scent of the candle is. As she slowly turns the candle, the camera turns with it.

Reed has a miniature duplicate of his house complete with little figures that represent Sister Barnes and Sister Paxton. In a sequence when Sister Paxton is trying to run away from Mr. Reed, we’re following her movements in the miniature but it seamlessly transitions from the model to the real thing when she enters the room and slams the door.

The method in which Heretic is written is somewhat odd. Not quite horrific enough to be scary with its religion-defying dialogue taking center stage, Heretic is essentially a two-hour sermon attempting to destroy your faith with some splashes of blood and a raggedy woman or two dying in a blueberry pie.  

It feels like if you walked into Heretic devoted to the Mormon religion, you’ll walk out of the theater a different person. Mr. Reed’s arguments regarding all religions stemming from the same concept are portrayed in a way that is believable and convincing.

He somehow rambles about Monopoly and board games, music, and vinyl records to demonstrate similarities between certain board games, how some songs are essentially the same tunes with different lyrics, and that all religions are more similar than dissimilar.

While the dialogue-driven film can be interesting, it’s also fairly boring. There’s an unsettling aspect to Mr. Reed’s behavior that capitalizes on the tension in the film. But there are also these long stretches where nothing happens besides the next topic of conversation or a weak payoff where someone’s throat is cut with a box cutter or something.

Heretic is beautifully shot with a stellar performance from Hugh Grant, but its intriguing concept is drowned out by the desire to deconvert the audience and have a lukewarm reveal regarding whatever the one-true religion is. Watching the film is like being trapped in a church of a religion you don’t believe in with an overwhelmingly passionate pastor trying to dissuade you from ever coming back.",2024-11-19T22:35:07.797Z,1138194,2 stars,0.4760946035385132
r96sk,8.0,"<em>'Heretic'</em> has its cast to thank for me fully enjoying it. The plot is most certainly suitably entertaining, don't get me wrong, but by the end it was almost wearing a tiny bit thin - and perhaps would have if not for those on the screen. All in all, though, it's a fun psychological horror.

Hugh Grant is tremendous in the main role, he is an actor that has the chops to do this genre - I've said it before, but I found his character in the <em>'Bridget Jones'</em> flicks to be creepy so that was all the proof I needed for the aforementioned to be true. Grant is certainly creepy here.

Chloe East and Sophie Thatcher are also good value, particularly the latter; this and 2025's <em>'Companion'</em> make for impressive work of her's - keen to see more.

Manuel São Bento,4.0,"The star-studded cast, featuring J.K. Simmons, Kiernan Shipka, Chris Evans, and Dwayne Johnson, brings a decent level of chemistry to the screen, which is one of the movie's few strengths. While the actors clearly enjoy playing off each other, the story itself is expectedly generic, relying heavily on predictable holiday tropes. The script fails to inject enough fun to offset its cliché formulas, and despite its festive intentions, the film feels stuck in cruise control, never quite capturing the magic or excitement one might hope for from a Christmas blockbuster.

Technically, RED ONE falters with its visuals. Almost every scene feels confined to a studio setting, and inconsistent VFX work makes it difficult to stay immersed in the story. The action sequences, though admittedly frequent, are mostly dimly lit, which diminishes any potential impact they might have had. None of these set pieces stand out, leaving viewers with little to savor beyond the familiar faces on screen. While it's not as terrible as some have claimed, Jake Kasdan ultimately delivers just another forgettable holiday flick, weighed down by formulaic storytelling and overshadowed - quite literally - by its murky, dark aesthetic.

r96sk,7.0,"Pretty solid festive fare, this.

<em>'Red One'</em> is perhaps slightly overlong and I didn't sense much chemistry between the cast, though those onscreen still give enjoyable performances and the plot is suitably entertaining whilst giving the necessary Xmas vibes. I was quite impressed with the special effects, I personally thought that side of this flick looked pretty neat.

Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans are fun enough in this. Johnson is a bit more serious than usual and I liked that, while Evans' character ends up being the heart of the movie. J. K. Simmons, more than Johnson, plays against type, it's actually unnerving seeing him portray a true good guy - was almost waiting for him to shout down someone's neck, as per.

Kiernan Shipka is decent, as is Kristofer Hivju - I rate their characters. Lucy Liu is underused, mind. Bonnie Hunt too, I guess. I can't really fault anyone from the cast though, they all do solid work. If I'm honest, I don't see this film having much of a lifespan in the old memory bank but, nevertheless, I'd still classify it as something worth viewing.",2024-11-22T00:57:04.040Z,845781,4 stars,0.6267074346542358
Wuchak,9.0,"**_Best Christmas Movie Ever!_**

After a key figure is kidnapped from the North Pole city of Myra, the commander of security (Dwayne Johnson) teams-up with a mercenary black-hat hacker (Chris Evans) to locate the victim (JK Simmons). They go to sunny Aruba for answers before entering the creepy lair of Krampus, Santa’s estranged adopted brother. Could the one behind the nefarious plot be the Christmas Witch, Grýla (Kiernan Shipka)?

“Red One” (2024) mixes the Santa Claus mythos with Marvel’s Thor movies for a totally kick-axx Christmas flick. For verification, there’s something similar to the Bifröst Bridge in Myra; Grýla is akin to Hela; there’s the similar technologically advanced flying crafts; trolls, ogres; and so on. 

The creativity scores out of the ballpark with one amusing bit after another, such as the Mythological Creatures Protection Agency (or whatever it’s called), the portals in the backs of toy stores, E.L.F., how Santa is able to make it down small chimneys, etc. Then there’s how the movie effectively appeals to both kids and adults, as well as the kids IN adults.

Kiernan Shipka as the antagonist turned 23 during shooting. I knew when I saw her in “Totally Killer” that she was something special. Lucy Liu is also on hand in a fairly beefy role as the security director of Myra.

It runs 2 hours, 3 minutes, and was shot in Georgia (Atlanta, Savannah and Jekyll Island) and Hawaii (Honolulu and Oahu).

RalphRahal,2.0,"Red One, starring Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans, had all the ingredients for a holiday blockbuster but missed the mark on nearly every level. Despite its star-studded cast and massive $250 million budget, the movie fails to live up to expectations, leaving both critics and audiences disappointed.

The first act feels rushed, skipping meaningful character introductions, and the story quickly falls into a predictable and uninspired plot. Dialogue lacks wit or charm, with most performances coming across as forced, almost like actors reciting homework. While Chris Evans and Lucy Liu offer the best performances of the bunch, they still don't elevate the movie much. The cinematography, sadly, doesn't help either, with over-reliance on weak CGI and clumsy action sequences that fail to impress.

Ultimately, ""Red One"" lacks the holiday magic or the action-packed excitement it promised. While it might work as a background movie for casual laughs at its script or acting, it’s hard to recommend for any other purpose. A major missed opportunity for a festive crowd-pleaser.",2024-12-21T11:48:01.022Z,845781,2 stars,0.8103634119033813

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Expectant father ""Justin"" (Nicholas Hoult) is slated for jury duty and so duly sets off for the selection hoping that he doesn't get picked and that he can return to his wife to await the arrival of their bundle of joy. Sadly, though, they like the cut of his jib and selected he is. It's a murder trial with a man accused of brutally killing his girlfriend after a bar-room brawl. Prosecutor and aspiring DA candidate ""Faith"" (Toni Collette) thinks it's all in the bag, but defence attorney ""Resnick"" (Chris Messina) isn't so sure. As the proceedings commence, our second juror gets a bit of a shock. Some of this evidence is proving startlingly evocative. The more he hears of the incident, the more he begins to realise that his job as a juror might prove to be much more personal than he anticipated. With pressure from his wife and his fellow jurors to get it all over with, he has to fight to try and find a way to more fully explore the evidence and luckily he manages to convince one of their number ""Harold"" (J.K. Simmons) to help him. As the they dig deeper, what might they find and what might they incentivise the prosecutor to find too? I think Hoult holds this together well, and as the audience becomes better briefed on just who did what to whom, director Clint Eastwood still manages to keep the film engaging and tensely paced leaving the audience with quite a moral dilemma as truths start to out and sympathies become severely tested. Simmons supports well, as do Collette and Messina but Kiefer Sutherland appears too sparingly to make much impact on the story so it really is left to us and ""Juror #2"" to come to terms with what happened and with our own consciences.",2024-11-03T19:39:14.411Z,1106739,4 stars,0.5148065686225891
r96sk,8.0,"<em>'Juror #2'</em> is very, very good!

Clint Eastwood just keeps pumping out movies, gotta respect the hustle. As someone who has seen every film of his, evidently now including this 40th (and final?) directorial piece, I'd say that this is one of his best works. He has done much better too, of course, but this 2024 release is impressive enough.

It's a clear Eastwood picture, so obviously made by someone from the old days as opposed to something that is undoubtedly made by today's market. It's supremely crafted in most areas, it relies of its fair share of convenience and isn't perfect (e.g. some, only some, of the dialogue is iffy). However, the attention-hooking plot means things never get dull.

It does feel like a two hour movie, but I don't necessarily mean that negatively - again, I was never uninterested in what I was watching. The cast are excellent. They are spearheaded by Nicholas Hoult, someone I've found quite meh in other productions but here he merits praise.

Chris Messina and Toni Collette are enjoyable in their respective roles, while in more minor parts the likes of J. K. Simmons, Amy Aquino and Cedric Yarbrough are solid. Another plus, away from the faces, is the very pleasing score, so credit to Mark Mancina for the music.

The film really manages to achieve moments of quiet excitement, especially when more damning pieces of evidence begin to emerge like so much debris rising to the surface of a lake. It is engrossing as the film gradually begins to narrow the focus down to concentrate on Kemp and Faith Killebrew. They both know the true set of circumstances surrounding the night in question and now one of them must step forward and sacrifice the other in order for justice to be done or else the consequences of inaction will be the terrible and corrosive burden of guilt surrounding the crime in question which will eventually and inevitably consume and destroy them both.

r96sk,9.0,"<em>'Here'</em> is one of the most original movies that I have personally seen, I can't say I've watched one that does anything like this. To tell such a story from (basically) a single camera angle is a brave choice, but it is one that Robert Zemeckis & Co. nail tremendously. I loved it.

I would've predicted some slow moments and that the sole vantage point might've gotten repetitive/boring, happily neither of those two things occurred. There are plenty of events that keep it all interesting and the unique angle ensures freshness. Those on the cast are, of course, helpful too.

Tom Hanks is as great as always, Robin Wright is also very good. Paul Bettany is, though, the one that stood out most to me, he is excellent at every moment. His character is most attached to all the more serious parts of this, most notably alongside Kelly Reilly's Rose.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"I really did quite like the concept behind this film. A sort of house-bound version of the ""Truman Show"" where a residence provides the continuity for the lives and loves of it's occupants over multiple generations. Our perspective comes from only one side of the room, looking out of the window at a grand Colonial mansion that once belonged to a Jefferson somewhere along the line. Right from the construction of this residence, we follow the lives of three distinct families, and the timelines are intertwined to avoid it just becoming a chronology of the place. It's also all interspersed by some native American imagery to remind us that this whole process of being born, breeding and dying is nothing new. The latter part of this film pulls the threads together of the mainstay of the storyline. The family of ""Al"" (Paul Bettany) and ""Rose"" (Kelly Reilly) who bring up their family and end up sharing in adulthood with their son ""Richard"" (Tom Hanks) and his wife ""Margaret"" (Robin Wright). It's this partnership that proves to the more turbulent as they find themselves trapped by his dead-end job, their dependancy on his parents for a roof over their head and as age overcomes all of these characters, the growing realisation that perhaps life is just passing - or has passed - them by. Robert Zemeckis has tried to construct something different here, and I did like that he didn't just trot a diary according to... The use of visually defined boxes to indicate to us that we are about to change timeline or storyline also, once you get used to it, works quite effectively, as does the use of the soundtrack to use music as a sign of changing attitudes. Sadly, though, the acting isn't really the sum of it's parts and the temptation to sink into the melodramatic seems to prove too much for all concerned. It is funny at times and the observational nature of the presentation can be poignant, too, but the flighty nature of the narrative is almost theatrical in style and doesn't allow us to really get our teeth into any of the characterisations. Wright increasingly underwhelms as an actor these days and here her pairing with te unremarkable Hanks comes across as all a bit shallow as we head a denouement that's rather clumsily telegraphed to us in the final fifteen minutes. It is an intriguing version of lives through a lense, and is certainly worth a watch. It's just a bit one-dimensional.",2025-01-22T12:26:44.273Z,940139,3 stars,0.5249963998794556
RalphRahal,2.0,"Time Cut tries to blend nostalgic 2000s vibes with a modern horror twist, but it just ends up feeling confused about its own identity. The plot takes too long to get going, and once it does, the execution is all over the place. It feels like it was aiming for a Scream or Totally Killer kind of self-aware horror, but the writing doesn't have the sharpness to pull it off. The directing is serviceable but uninspired, and the cinematography doesn’t do much to elevate the experience. It’s visually competent, but nothing stands out as particularly creative or memorable.

The acting is a mixed bag, with some performances feeling decent while others struggle with awkward dialogue. The script doesn’t do the cast any favors, filled with lines that don’t land and character decisions that make you question the logic behind them. If there’s one redeeming quality, it’s the soundtrack, which absolutely nails the early 2000s aesthetic. But even that feels like it’s trying too hard to sell the era rather than naturally fitting into the movie. Ultimately, Time Cut is forgettable, and the best part about it might just be looking up the soundtrack on YouTube and moving on.",2025-03-07T21:34:58.675Z,827931,2 stars,0.5557408928871155
Brent Marchant,6.0,"It’s more than a little frustrating when a film seemingly has all of the elements needed to make it work except the one that’s most crucial, the one that enables a production to brilliantly succeed or doom it to failure – the story. Such is the case with director Edward Berger’s latest, the much-anticipated, much-celebrated drama about the convening of a papal conclave to select a new pope. From a technical standpoint, the filmmaker has pulled together everything that should make this an epic picture – a gorgeous production design, stunning and inventive cinematography, and a stellar cast featuring superb performances by the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow and Isabella Rossellini, as well as fine turns by such lesser-known performers (at least to American audiences) as Lucian Msamati and Sergio Castellito. The picture also raises some insightful observations (though a little too infrequently for my tastes) about the current state of the Roman Catholic Church, particularly its foot-dragging on implementing reforms, the incessant high-profile scandals that have rocked the institution, and the rising tide of unflattering public perceptions among its increasingly skeptical practitioners, all of which weigh heavily on the College of Cardinals in determining who should be named as the new Holy Father. Unfortunately, though, the story and script leave a lot to be desired. For starters, much of the film’s opening act moves by at a glacial pace, frequently causing one’s eyelids to become more than a little heavy. As the picture moves into the meat of the story – the conclave itself – it waxes somewhat melodramatic, not unlike a glorified 1980s prime time TV soap opera. Its attempt to come across as an intrigue-laced thriller amounts to more than a succession of backstabbing segments in which the leading candidates to become the next pontiff are systematically eliminated through the revelation of skeletons in their respective closets. Finally, as the movie enters the stretch run, it throws in several twists and turns that either come completely out of left field (and somewhat implausibly at that) or that predictably materialize on cue thanks to the planting of patently obvious clues early on that were wholly impossible to ignore as the story plays out. Regrettably, these narrative foibles undermine all of the other fine attributes that this production has going for it, ultimately amounting to a case of being long on style but a little skimpy on substance, a shortcoming that also plagued Berger’s last feature outing, “All Quiet on the Western Front” (2022). Unlike many others who have been so profoundly moved and thoroughly captivated by this release, perhaps my not having been born and raised Roman Catholic has somehow prevented me from fully appreciating the depth and magnitude accorded to this offering’s contents. But, as someone who seeks to evaluate everything I screen on an equal footing, I can’t help but observe that “Conclave” simply doesn’t measure up when it comes to what it takes to make a genuine big screen epic.",2024-10-31T11:26:50.756Z,974576,3 stars,0.500454843044281

Peter Straughan's screenplay tackles universal themes of corruption and idealism with rare sensitivity, balancing narrative tension with emotional depth.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"When the Pope dies, it falls to the Dean of the College of Cardinals, ""Cardinal Lawrence"" (Ralph Fiennes) to organise the conclave that will elect his successor. His own personal preference is for the liberal ""Bellini"" (Stanley Tucci) but there is also plenty of support elsewhere. ""Adeyami"" (Lucian Msamati) could be the first pontiff from Africa; ""Tremblay"" (John Lithgow) is an ambitious American and ""Tedesco"" (Sergio Castellitto) the formidable and ultra-conservative candidate. As they are all assembling, a surprise arrives in the form of the hitherto unknown Cardinal Archbishop of Kabul (Carlos Diehz) and so now, the red tables are set for a process that shines a light on the flawed humanity of many of the men gathered together. For all of their ostensibly benign spirituality, these are politicians and even ""Lawrence"" finds his faith, his patience and his loyalties tested as he becomes aware of a conspiracy. Or is it a series of conspiracies? Is he being manipulated? Is it all just a smokescreen? With the voting showing little sign of breaking a deadlock amongst the 108 men sequestered in the room, he begins to fear that the outside world might conclude that the church is divided. That very same outside world, meantime, is suffering from a spate of terrorist attacks that even the ancient walls of the Vatican cannot shield them from, as the old traditions battle for supremacy with the more modern ones. Not since the ""English Patient"" (1996) have I seen Fiennes deliver like this. His character is a conflicted one, and he portrays that effectively - especially as he wrestles with his own crises of conscience and faith. Those deliberations lead him to a very difficult choice at a denouement that I didn't really love. It came a lot from left field and though quite thought-provoking to an extent, seemed just a bit too contrived to make a point that I felt rather stretched plausibility in what was hitherto quite a compelling thriller. Isabella Rossellini barely features and I thought added little to the drama beyond being a conduit for other, rather undercooked, aspects of the plot to develop. It's a good, solid, thriller that illustrates that politicians in cassocks and red hats are no less ruthless when they play for power, and it is a good watch.

Shelbyq96,9.0,"Conclave is a film for those willing to immerse themselves fully. It's a slow-burning, almost hypnotic narrative where every word, every pause holds weight. There's no attempt to shock or force drama here. This is a measured, deeply atmospheric experience.

Ralph Fiennes delivers one of the finest performances of his career. His character is like a wall with cracks—you peer into them and sense the storm brewing behind. His restraint is captivating, and when he finally raises his voice, it feels like the rupture of silence itself, as if his inner chaos can no longer be contained. These moments tear through the screen.

Berger crafts an utterly unique atmosphere. The Sistine Chapel, the endless papal corridors, shadowy corners, and striking red-and-black tones transform into active participants in the story. This isn’t just a backdrop—it’s the film’s lifeblood.

Stefan Fontaine’s cinematography breathes life into these walls, slicing through spaces with long takes and obsessive symmetry. Each frame feels like a gallery piece—it’s a joy to watch.

Volker Bertelmann's score beats like the film’s heart, tightening the tension to its limits. His thunderous, almost liturgical chords make each vote feel monumental and decisive.

The most fascinating part: the story unfolds gradually. While the initial monotony of dialogue may seem tedious, the deeper you dive, the more palpable the tension becomes. The intrigue builds, and the details—from the architecture to the character dynamics—form a compelling tapestry of a near-detective political thriller.

But the ending… It leaves you questioning whether the journey was worth it. On one hand, the open-ended conclusion provokes reflection. On the other, it might leave some viewers puzzled or even underwhelmed.

Yet, Conclave is undeniably a film for connoisseurs: profound, meditative, and aesthetically impeccable. It’s not just about Vatican intrigue; it’s a deeply symbolic story of power, faith, and doubt. Berger’s mastery of space, Fiennes’ magnetic presence, and the soul-piercing score come together to create one of the year’s most stylish and powerful films.

Yep, we've seen it all before and though the visual effects are pretty impressive, that's not really enough to sustain it as it rather procedurally rolls along.

It feels like the filmmakers just kind of shrugged and said, “Eh, good enough.” Sure, there are flashes of that buddy-comedy charm, but not enough to save the movie from feeling like it’s limping to the finish line.

If this is the final Venom movie (and I hope it is), I’m not gonna cry about it. It’s a mixed bag—fun in bits, but overall, it’s like Venom himself: a bit too sloppy to fully love.",2024-12-26T10:01:12.555Z,912649,3 stars,0.7477539777755737
good.film,-1.0,"It feels great to laugh straight after you’ve just welled up. 

The characters in Memoir of a Snail, the new animated tale from Academy Award winner Adam Elliot, feel authentically real to us - and even though Elliot includes jokes, he doesn’t joke ABOUT them. 

He lays them bare to us with respect, and imbues his odd menagerie with… well, with dignity. Which is a funny thing to say about something with plasticine eyeballs and glycerine tears.

Chris Sawin,9.0,"Australian animator and filmmaker Adam Elliot’s last full-length feature film was Mary and Max (2009). Memoir of a Snail is narrated and told from the point of view of Grace Pudel (Sarah Snook). Grace details her life story that finds humor and sentimentality in the face of depression, shortcomings, and letdowns.

There are two people in the world that Grace feels comfortable with: her twin brother Gilbert (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and her best friend Pinky (Jacki Weaver). Their mother died during childbirth and their father is a drunk paraplegic who is a former street performer and animator from France. Grace developed the desire to be an animator while Gilbert wants to be a street performer.

After their father passes away, the twins are separated and put into foster homes in two separate states. They spend the majority of the film writing letters to one another and dreaming of the day that they can reunite.

As an adult, Grace meets Pinky. Pinky wears giant, red-rim glasses, is covered in wrinkles and liver spots, and habitually smokes cigars. She has traveled all over the world, met countless people, been with only a handful of memorable men, and has lived a crazy life full of no regrets or dull moments. She quickly becomes Grace’s best friend.

Grace becomes obsessed with snails at a young age. She keeps live ones as pets in a jar and buys every snail-related knickknack she can get her hands on. She also likes to read trashy romance novels and is constantly eating Chiko Rolls, which are spring rolls that are the size of burritos.

If you haven’t seen Mary and Max or his 2003 Academy Award-winning short Harvie Krumpet, Adam Elliot’s stop-motion animated style isn’t as smooth and polished as recent Laika or Aardman films have become. Elliot’s stop-motion still looks like it was hand-crafted by humans – visible balls of clay that have been molded into these soul-driven characters that we eventually grow to love.

It would have been extremely easy for Adam Elliot to make Memoir of a Snail into a film that emotionally destroys the audience and never looks back. However, the film is written in a way that makes you feel an entire spectrum of emotions over a mere 90 minutes.

Anyone who grew up as a loner will sympathize with Grace, especially when devoting your life to collecting something you love. But her story is presented in a way that allows you to laugh at all the terrible things in her life. The characters in the film, no matter how much screen time they’re given, are loaded with eccentricities.

There’s a bum who lost his job as a court judge because he liked to masturbate in court, the foster family Gilbert is sent to is a wildly religious one complete with gibberish prayers and apple worshipping, and Grace falls in love with a man in the neighborhood while he’s using his leaf blower.

Surprisingly, Memoir of a Snail is R-rated. There’s some mild vulgarity in there and repeated use of the middle finger, but there’s also a shocking amount of nudity. Grace’s foster family has this boring front of designing traffic lights. They create awards for her every week and hang them on her wall to get her to stop being sad about being separated from her brother. But they’re also swingers who like to take exotic vacations purely driven based on having sex with new people in a new place.

Memoir of a Snail is an animated film that is as enjoyable on an emotional level as a thought-provoking one. The film has several life lessons that stick with you afterward. Grace, Gilbert, and their father all wrestle with feeling caged in throughout the film, but the difference is who feels like a glass half full, a glass half empty, and just a glass.

Made on a rapid 32-week shooting schedule where animators had to complete 10 seconds a day to finish on time, Memoir of a Snail is a small-budget animated film that feels like a handmade labor of love. 

It’s a film that honors weird people no matter how bizarre they may be. Next to its superb writing and ability to make you laugh while ripping your heartstrings to shreds, that is what makes it so beautiful and memorable.",2024-11-17T17:53:38.615Z,1064486,4 stars,0.5118743181228638
CinemaSerf,7.0,"When an elderly lady gives out her last breath, and yells something about potatoes, we realise that “Grace” is now on her own. She’s a middle aged woman wearing a knitted hat with two big eyes poking from stalks on the top. She’s what you might call a glass half empty sort of person, and as she releases her pet snail “Sylvia” from her jar into the vegetable garden she begins to regale us with the story of just how she, and her long-lost brother “Gilbert” grew up with their paraplegic dad; became orphaned, separated and then how she spent the rest of her life in increasing isolation making some rather unfortunate choices. Indeed, by an early age “Grace” is really only happy living in her room with her collection of gastropods. There’s a lovely melancholy to this story and the dialogue is riddled with typically Australian epithets, sarcasm and very dry wit as the tale of woes upon woes upon more woes is engagingly unfolded over the next ninety minutes, but it’s the astonishing detail of the animation that really stands out here. Right from the beginning, as we tour a home that looks more like an old curiosity shop we see not just great detail amongst the mechanics of the imagery, but there’s plenty of more subtle content hidden in plain sight for us to spot and frequently raise a smile at, too. There’s an enjoyably compelling attraction from her downbeat monologues as she lurches from bad news to more bad news and I thought it had shades of the Tim Burton too it as it edged towards it’s denouement. It’s really superbly crafted artistry this, and though it does put a smiley face on things, it also takes quite a poignant look at family and loneliness too. This is really a film for a big screen if you get the chance, some of the facial expressions are every bit as human as anything people can do for real!",2025-02-19T11:39:36.217Z,1064486,4 stars,0.6301416754722595
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,-1.0,"It’s been a long time since I’ve been moved by a piece of cinema as much as I was with “Memoir of a Snail,” a dark, profound, and highly personal stop-motion film from writer / director Adam Elliot . This work of animation confirms the power of the medium as a vessel for mature, deeply philosophical storytelling, and it’s just a beautiful film from start to finish.

Crafted with painstaking detail, the film is a bittersweet memoir of Grace Pudel (voice of Sarah Snook), a woman overcome with melancholy in 1970s Australia. When she was younger, Grace and her twin brother Gilbert (voice of Kodi Smit-McPhee) were separated and sent to grow up in starkly contrasting home environments. He was abused in a cruel Evangelical household while she found herself slowly withdrawing from the world. Isolated and sad, Grace’s life journey is one that’s filled with repeated heartbreak, but she still has a few passions in life (including romance novels, guinea pigs, and snails). This film tells her story.

The film exhibits the emotional resonance that animation can achieve when placed in the hands of a skilled storyteller. Intense and authentic, this is one for thoughtful adults rather than a throwaway for kids, especially since Elliot touches on themes of suffering, love, loss, and tragedy. This highly emotional film hit me, hard.

The gloomy visual style beautifully complements the gravity of the film’s themes. Each frame feels delicately and deliberately crafted like a piece of handmade art, capturing the melancholy of Grace’s life. It’s a world that’s bleak, yet also cozy when she’s within the confines of her small world.

The story continues to show Grace’s slow transformation through her unlikely friendship with the Pinky (voice of Jacki Weaver), an eccentric elderly woman. The pair share a healing bond that adds a bittersweet layer to a narrative that’s rich with tragedy and pain. There’s a lovely tenderness to the relationship between Pinky and Grace, which gives an authentic look at the importance of human connection in an increasingly harsh world.

Achingly beautiful and deeply profound, “Memoir of a Snail” is a very different type of animated film. Powerful and complex, this is nothing short of a masterwork in animated storytelling.

""Smile 2 not only proves to be the best horror movie of 2024, but it also stands out as one of the best horror sequels in recent years, improving upon all aspects that made the original a gigantic success. Through a thought-provoking exploration of trauma, loss, and guilt, the story’s rising emotional intensity elevates the fascinating horror elements, creating an unforgettable cinematic experience.

Naomi Scott’s career-best, riveting performance combines with technical qualities worthy of awards-season recognition, solidifying Parker Finn’s name as one of the most promising filmmakers in contemporary horror.""

r96sk,-1.0,"An improvement on the (good) original.

Naomi Scott's performance is outstanding, she is so convincing and fully committed to the role all the way through - to the point that she elevates the film as a whole up a notch. The rest of the cast are good, e.g. Rosemarie DeWitt, but <em>'Smile 2'</em> is very much Scott's movie.

The run time is perhaps a little longer than it needs to be, though to be honest that is only a minor criticism in the grand scheme of things. Much of what is onscreen helps nullify any potential (minor) pacing issues, the violence and gore is quite graphic but it is nicely done and is exactly what we want to see from a production of this sort, let's be real.

I will say this does feature a few too many cheap jump scares, something I'm not a big fan of, but just like the above it isn't a notion that hinders the overall quality of the end result. Based on the ending, the next sequel could be a lot of fun - here's hoping!",2024-10-18T18:26:21.847Z,1100782,4 stars,0.7369611859321594
No,-1.0,"Tween horror.  Perfect to have on in the background whilst making tiktoks or like somthing I dunno lol.
I get the feeling the script for this was written in text speak and emojis.  I'm not sure if this is Blumhouse, I couldn't summon enough interest to bother finding out.

If you've seen the first flick (not movie and certainly not film), you know what this is about, cheese ""jump scares"" that solely rely on the sound being loud and some tween-palette friendly ""gore"" - a bit of blood.  Nothing's shocking, horrifying or engaging and the ""acting"" is terrible, which is maybe the most shocking element.

That guy that was in The White Lotus, I've seen be good in things other than this, he's not good in the 5 minutes or so he's in this.
Naomi Scott waddles round like a less obese version of Florence Pugh with even less charisma.  She's pretending to be a pop star, a story misstep that leads to some AI generated music that somehow sounds a decade or so dated.

Film could have been vastly improved if it was ~80 minutes of Scott being attack with a screwdriver, but that didn't happen and it's 2hours of mediocrity.  Looking at the sidebar here, it made money, so I guess we're getting Smile 3.

Brent Marchant,6.0,"We’re all familiar with the old adage that, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. It’s a notion that applies not only to what can happen in everyday life, but also to what shows up on the big screen, as the latest feature from writer-director Sean Baker illustrates. This widely acclaimed indie offering follows the misadventures of a Brooklyn lap dancer/sex worker (Mikey Madison) who falls for the insanely rich, self-absorbed, wildly irresponsible son of a Russian oligarch (Mark Eydelshteyn). Together they take the plunge into an edgy, wacked-out fairy tale, a dark storybook romance strung out on steroids, quaaludes and crack. Their whirlwind affair soon lands them in Las Vegas, culminating in a green card wedding that junior’s mobster parents (Darya Ekamasova, Aleksey Serebryakov) want annulled at any cost, even if it means calling on their oily, bumbling posse of cronies and heavies (Karren Karagulian, Vache Tovmasyan, Yura Borisov) to lean on the alleged lovebirds. But achieving that goal ultimately proves more difficult than imagined. As a cross-country chase ensues, a string of frenzied events leaves mom, dad and friends infuriated and the Gothamite Cinderella disillusioned, having erroneously thought she’d truly hit the jackpot this time. From this, one might easily think this premise has a solid foundation for an outrageous, uproarious comedy, but, sadly, the film lives up to its potential only some of the time. To be sure, there is some genuinely hysterical, wonderfully inventive material here, but it only hits the mark about half the time. What’s more, much of the story (especially in the film’s first half) is predictable, almost clichéd, with some bits dragging on needlessly long. Indeed, I’m somewhat mystified as to what all the critical fuss is about, something perhaps best evidenced by the picture’s capture of the Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, the event’s highest honor. I readily admit to being a fan of Baker’s work, having immensely enjoyed his previous efforts “Red Rocket” (2021), “The Florida Project” (2017) and “Tangerine” (2015). But I’m genuinely at a loss to understand the level of praise that’s been lavished on this release. It’s a capable film in a number of respects, but the filmmaker clearly has done better, and those prior offerings make better viewing options in my opinion. Don’t fall for all the hype here, as this really is one of those cases of something being too good to be true.",2024-10-30T14:29:56.328Z,1064213,4 stars,0.47327908873558044
CinemaSerf,7.0,"""Ani"" (Mikey Madison) works as a private dancer in New York when she is asked by her boss to go look after some visiting Russians. That's when she encounters the young ""Vanya"" (Mark Eydelshteyn). He's pretty drunk, completely stoned and has more money than God. He wants a dance, he wants much more - but that's not allowed in the club, so he invites her to his luxury pad next day for fun. She actually quite likes his youthful exuberance - and his cash - and after a few days, a Russian sable coat, and a trip to Vegas, they find themselves marred. Social media now takes an hand and his oligarch mother hears news that her son has married an hooker. Livid, she instructs her local fixer ""Toros"" (Karren Karagulian) to sort the mess out. He duly sends his two enforcers to the house where all hell promptly breaks loose. ""Garnick"" (Vache Tovmasyan) and ""Tom"" (Anton Bitter) are merely to detain the pair until their boss arrives to insist that marriage is going to be annulled; ""Ani"" is having none of that and ""Vanya"" - well he's just a little bit conflicted and quickly things start to go pear-shaped! This film starts off strongly with an entertaining courtship scenario played out between two actors who really do look like they are enjoying themselves. Eydelshteyn delivers enthusiastically and acrobatically, there's loads of sex and quite witty dialogue that plays nicely on the language barriers. Once the second phase of the film starts, though, it runs out of steam a little. ""Vanya"" doesn't feature so much and the story becomes a little less engaging as the rather too gentle thugs and the increasingly irate girl try to get everyone to the courthouse for the ruling before his angry mother arrives. That leaves us with too much overacting from Karagulian and some increasingly implausible scenarios as the air is gradually let out of the thing and it comes to end rather disappointingly. At it's best, though, the first hour is quickly paced and takes an amiable swipe at the sex trade and the players who make and take from it. Certainly worth a watch, it just hasn't quite the courage of it's initial convictions.",2024-11-14T09:11:41.976Z,1064213,3 stars,0.5795633792877197
RalphRahal,7.0,"Anora is a film that starts off strong, pulling you in with an intriguing setup and a well-paced first act. It follows a story that keeps you invested, blending drama with some unexpected humor. The second act stretches a bit longer than needed, but it's clear that was intentional to build atmosphere and let certain themes play out. While the pacing is deliberate, it sometimes feels like it's lingering in places that don't add much depth to the characters. That being said, the buildup is engaging, even if the payoff leaves something to be desired.

Sean Baker's directing is solid, capturing a raw, almost documentary-like feel that makes the film feel real and immersive. He knows how to make everyday settings feel alive and uses long takes effectively. The cinematography complements this, keeping things grounded with natural lighting and handheld shots that add an almost voyeuristic feel to the story. It’s visually well-crafted, even if it doesn’t aim for anything particularly stylized. The way the camera lingers on certain moments adds weight to the film's themes, even when the script doesn’t fully explore them.

Mikey Madison delivers a standout performance, carrying much of the film. She brings a layered energy to the role, making her character feel both confident and vulnerable when needed. The supporting cast does their job well, but the script doesn't give them much depth to work with. That’s one of the film’s weaknesses, while it sets up an interesting premise and characters, it doesn’t fully flesh them out. You get a sense of their motivations, but not much beyond that. The dialogue is sharp in some moments but feels underdeveloped in others, leaving certain interactions feeling a bit hollow.

The score and sound design are subtle, used more for atmosphere than standout moments. The film relies heavily on natural sounds and ambient noise, which works well for its grounded approach. It enhances the realism but doesn't do much to elevate the emotions of the film. 

Overall, Anora is a well-directed and well-acted film that keeps you engaged, but it doesn’t quite stick the landing. If you’re looking for a character-driven story with a raw, unfiltered feel, it’s worth a watch, but don’t expect a big payoff in the end.",2025-02-07T11:41:37.199Z,1064213,4 stars,0.5499210357666016
r96sk,10.0,"<em>'Anora'</em> is an absolute cracker! The film is unadulterated chaos, I honestly needed the silentness of it ending so I could relax. As usual, I'm not one to judge it on its deep-rooted meaning or whatever, I'll leave that to others, all I can say is that it's a blast and I unequivocally loved it.

Mikey Madison's performance is sensational, quite the showing indeed! Apparently I've seen her in three other things (much less prominent roles, admittedly) before, evidently I don't remember her from those - but safe to say, I won't be forgetting Madison from this at any point. Superb!

Away from the star performer, Mark Eydelshteyn makes the most out of his role. The trio of Karren Karagulian, Vache Tovmasyan and Yura Borisov are great comedic support. I've seen Aleksei Serebryakov here and there down the years and he always plays the same roles, I like him though.

The 139 minutes go by in a flash, with the utterly chaotic nature it is no surprise. It isn't the most difficult movie to predict given that you are waiting for the crap to hit the fan, but how it gets to that point is a wild ride to witness - the concluding scene is stand out, too.

I still have three more of the nominees to watch, but this overtakes <em>'The Substance'</em> as the film that would hypothetically get my vote for Best Picture; not that I take much value from that (or any other) awards ceremony.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,-1.0,"Despite a very rough start, “Anora” ultimately offers a unique and entertaining exploration of the humanity behind sex work and the complexities of love, pain, and trauma. I was so close to giving up on the film during its excruciating opening thirty minutes, which I found dull, grating, and gratuitous. The early part of the movie is laden with an unnecessary and gratuitous parade of explicit scenes and a focus on unlikable characters doing uninteresting things. Now I am thankful that I didn’t storm out of the theater, because the eventual payoff is more than worth the investment.

As I reflect on the film, I’ve come to the realization that the style and tone of the film’s opening half hour might be more intentional than I first thought. Writer and director Sean Baker, known for his ability to capture the lives of marginalized people with empathy and complexity in his previous works “The Florida Project” and “Tangerine,” appears to be making a deliberate statement. The first act, with its emphasis on the superficial, transactional view of sex work, feels almost intentionally alienating, highlighting how society often reduces sex workers to mere objects of desire that exist solely to be used, abused, and discarded. It’s designed to make viewers uncomfortable, mostly because it seems to be a critique of how these people are seen as less than human. Sex workers like Anora are often dismissed as disposable rather than as individuals with depth and feelings.

Once the film transitions into the second act, it gains momentum and its true heartbeat emerges. The focus shifts to Anora (Mikey Madison), a young sex worker from Brooklyn who impulsively marries a powerful Russian oligarch’s playboy son, Ivan (Mark Eydelshteyn). As news of the marriage reaches Russia, it threatens to derail her new life. Ivan’s parents are infuriated and head to New York to have the union annulled. The plot sounds like a simple and goofy romantic comedy, but it becomes more layered as the film progresses.

Baker excels in depicting characters on the fringes of society, and Anora is no exception. She’s flawed, complicated, and completely human in her desire to be happy, safe, and loved. As we get to know the character better, her strength, resilience, and vulnerability shines through. It’s a real testament to how much Baker understands his characters and the environments they inhabit. They are never caricatures but relatable, normal people caught up in difficult, often tragic circumstances. And this, I think, is where the film really succeeds.

It’s a serious story that takes an unexpected turn when a trio of bumbling criminal characters show up, adding some much-needed levity and energy to the film. The comedic angle is strange but also highly entertaining, which provides a nice contrast to the tension-filled dramatic elements. The humor balances the more serious undertones of the story and injects an unexpected freshness into the film, making it easier (and a lot more fun) to invest in Anora’s journey.

What’s really going to have audiences talking is the ending, and it’s the place where the film leaves its most notable mark. I can imagine the final frame will be analyzed and discussed and misunderstood, but it’s one of the most profound, heartbreaking, and touching conclusions I’ve seen this year.

WARNING: I am issuing a spoiler alert for the next paragraph. Please stop reading now if you’ve not yet seen the film.

When Igor (Yura Borisov) and Anora are together in the final act, this isn’t a typical “rescue” or “knight in shining armor” trope that you’d expect to find in a romantic film. Their sad and painful attempt at intimacy is a deeply meaningful and emotional recognition between two people who have been hurt by the world in similar ways. It’s a poignant reminder that love and healing often come from shared experiences of pain, and that empathy can transcend even the most complicated circumstances. It’s just so heartbreaking and sad, and I’m not sure there’s another film that’s so accurately or sensitively conveyed a person’s haunting emotional wounds with such authenticity.

It goes without saying that despite a miserable opening, “Anora” ultimately won me over. This is a flawed but compelling story about a woman reclaiming her agency, confronting the societal labels placed on her, and finding something profoundly human in a world that seeks to strip her of it.

badelf,5.0,"Sean Baker's Oscar-winning ""Anora"" presents a peculiar paradox of contemporary cinema: a film celebrated for its supposed boundary-pushing that ultimately offers little beyond its taboo subject matter. At 139 minutes, Baker's tale of a sex worker who briefly marries into Russian wealth before facing brutal rejection stretches a thin premise far beyond its natural breaking point.

Mikey Madison delivers a performance of remarkable depth, finding nuanced humanity in a character that the screenplay itself seems uninterested in fully exploring. Her work transcends the material, suggesting emotional complexities the script merely gestures at. Madison deserves every accolade for creating a compelling person where the screenplay offers only a situation.

The film's moments of genuine comedy provide welcome relief but highlight the fundamental problem: ""Anora"" mistakes setting (sex work) for substance. When compared to Jean-Luc Godard's ""Vivre sa Vie,"" which used prostitution as a lens to examine profound questions of autonomy, capitalism, and gender, Baker's film feels superficial. Godard achieved more philosophical depth in 83 minutes than Baker manages in over two hours.

Contemporary cinema increasingly confuses progressive subject matter with progressive thinking. Merely depicting marginalized experiences without offering fresh insight or formal innovation becomes a hollow exercise. One cannot help but wonder whether ""Anora"" received accolades for what it attempted to say rather than what it actually achieved.

The central narrative - a woman from difficult circumstances discovering she can be loved for herself - is neither original nor developed with particular insight. What might have been a focused, powerful short film instead becomes a meandering feature that suggests profundity without delivering it.

Baker's technical competence is evident, but technical skill alone cannot disguise the absence of a compelling artistic vision. ""Anora"" ultimately represents cinema that has forgotten the difference between depicting life and illuminating it.",2025-04-10T13:01:41.816Z,1064213,4 stars,0.36589646339416504

""We Live in Time is a testament to the power of cinema that transcends the simplicity of its story with a moving, complex approach to the central themes of human existence.

John Crowley and Nick Payne deliver a narrative where form and content harmonize, using a nonlinear structure not as a mere stylistic gimmick but as an invitation to reflect on how time, memories, and personal choices shape who we are and who we love. With sublime, heartfelt performances from Andrew Garfield and Florence Pugh, audiences are guided through a delicate, authentic study of love, loss, and the fragility of our connections.

In the end, it leaves a bittersweet feeling: the remembrance of the fleeting beauty of shared moments and the inevitability of time that shapes and erodes everything.""

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Suffice to say that ""Tobias"" (Andrew Garfield) isn't having a good day. He is sitting alone in an hotel room without even a biro to sign his newly arrived divorce papers. He sets off to rectify that but en route back unexpectedly (and painfully) encounters successful chef ""Almut"" (Florence Pugh) before he awakens, in a fetching neck-brace, in an hospital corridor. That's the tentative beginning for what becomes quite an engagingly portrayed love story that manages to marry quite a bit of humour with some tragedy, tension and toilet-floor activity as we are presented with two characters who might resonate with the viewer more than many. The story itself isn't really anything new. What makes this work is the dynamic between Garfield and Pugh. His is a more understated role, her's the more forceful - but both complement the other really quite effectively as the threads of their respective stories and of their burgeoning relationship are quite poignantly interwoven into a current timeline that has already pretty much telegraphed the inevitability of the denouement to us. It's that chemistry that rings true and even though the travails are rather piled up on the couple, their solutions to many of their issues are plausibly played out amidst some affection, temper tantrums, selfishness, tears and fine dining. Lee Braithwaite appears sparingly but quite usefully as her commis ""Jade"" who manages to allow us all to take the occasional breather from the increasing intensity of the plot, but essentially this is a two-hander that tugs gently at the heart-strings, but is not a film that oozes sentimentality.

r96sk,10.0,"<em>'We Live in Time'</em> is painfully brilliant. I had no clue what this was about, aside from its romantic comedy-drama genre, so went into it blind and, let me tell you, I was sold within the first few scenes. The acting from the two leads right at the beginning is just incredible.

That's only initially too, because the performances of Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield are sensational all the way through; some of the best acting I've seen for a while, their chemistry is absolutely on point. They are two people I already enjoy, but this is undoubtedly the best work I've seen from them thus far.

The film holds a heavy plot, though does an excellent job at making the highs high and the lows low. The non-linear narrative can be a bit back and forth, but I personally felt like the timeline largely spoke for itself anyway; all becomes clear. There's much emotion packed in there.",2025-01-10T19:35:06.252Z,1100099,4 stars,0.5092831254005432
CinemaSerf,6.0,"I was really quite disappointed with this. It focusses on the rise of Donald Trump, and in that role Sebastian Stan proves quite effective at mimicking some of the famous mannerisms of the man himself. The facial expressions and the habit of repeating himself to thrust home his point are well captured by this performance. The rest of it, though, came across as little better than crude, occasionally violent, speculation centred around his relationship with the celebrated, and much feared, attorney Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong) whose thinly disguised homosexuality proves to be a more telling indictment of a New York that was beginning to come to terms with AIDS. Trump's rise from wealth to greater wealth and prosperity is skirted over too superficially with little meat put on the bones of his property acquisitions, developments and battles with an Ed Koch-led city hall, and it's all presented a bit too episodically weakly. Maria Bakalova acquits herself well enough as Ivana but as to the drama concerning the rest of his family, that's undercooked and I struggled to identify the accent(s) that seemed to be coming from his mother (Catherine McNally) as the importance of that torrid family unit struggles to impact on the story. For me, Strong steals his scenes and delivers well as the manipulative and scheming lawyer with few scruples, but the rest of this is all a bit of a soap that will probably polarise opinion as effectively as does Donald Trump himself.",2024-10-09T09:42:58.696Z,1182047,2 stars,0.5075623989105225

The exceptional, award-worthy performances from Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong elevate a bold script unafraid to incriminate a former - and perhaps future - POTUS in multiple ways, revealing shocking events from his life and career.

Brent Marchant,8.0,"In the interest of full disclosure, originally I had not intended to watch this film, a decision I’ll freely admit was governed by my politics, especially after reading several mistaken early reviews claiming that the picture presented a “sympathetic” look at its protagonist (a conclusion that, in hindsight, truly escapes me). However, I changed my mind after hearing about the recently announced Oscar nominations bestowing accolades on Sebastian Stan for lead actor and Jeremy Strong for supporting actor for their performances in this picture. And it was through that viewing experience that I realized I should not have let my politics get in the way of my screening decisions. Director Ali Abbasi’s fourth feature outing is truly one of 2024’s surprise stand-outs, one that certainly deserves more attention and recognition than it has received. This “origin story” about the meteoric rise of New York real estate mogul Donald Trump (Stan) in the 1970s and 80s candidly illustrates how he became the individual he is today under the tutelage of lawyer Roy Cohn (Strong), the infamous, underhanded political fixer who rose to prominence as Sen. Joseph McCarthy’s “trusted” associate during the 1950s Congressional anti-Communist hearings. Cohn, a man who would stop at virtually nothing to get his way for himself and his clients, groomed his impressionable apprentice on how to do the same for himself in business and in life, developments chronicled here in unreserved detail. In that sense, then, one could probably best characterize this offering as “instructive” about the nature of the man who went on to be elected to a second term as President, despite his many obvious and highly public failings. This story is brought to life thanks to the superb (and largely overlooked) screenwriting of Gabriel Sherman in only his second feature film outing, along with the picture’s fine editing, spot-on period piece production design, and outstanding performances of its two principals, particularly Strong. While the film indeed presents an excellent depiction of Trump’s apprenticeship in the business world, it could have been stronger when examining his personal life, particularly his stormy courtship of and arm’s-length marriage to wife Ivana (Maria Bakalova) and his rocky relationship with his family, both of which could have used some bolstering. Nevertheless, “The Apprentice” genuinely is one of the year’s best releases. It’s just a shame that more viewers didn’t see it before the last election.",2025-01-25T15:29:23.153Z,1182047,4 stars,0.5223730206489563
CinemaSerf,7.0,"This maybe hit the cinemas a month too early as there's a distinctly festive feel to this latest outing for the menacing ""Art"" the clown. He descends upon the townsfolk with blood-thirsty enthusiasm causing some brutal carnage but then he and his equally heinous pal ""Vicky"" (Samantha Scaffidi) go for a long nap. It's a pair of unfortunate demolition guys who provide their wake up entertainment and rejuvenated, they set out in search of ""Sienna"" (Lauren LaVera) and brother ""Jonathan"" (Elliott Fulham) - and woe betides anyone who gets in the way - even if you are dressed as Santa Claus. This is by far the best of the three so far, I think. There's much less repetition with the standard slashing-fayre and a bit more, dare I say, intimacy from our ""Terrifier"" as David Howard Thornton imbues his character with more akin to an emotional and quirky mime artist. There's more sadness, mischief and playfulness as he wields everything from an axe to a chain-saw. Shower sex might never be the same again! It's really the last half hour that gets it moving and though that scenario is largely predictable and I have to say that none of the speaking-part acting here is really very good, the tension mounts nicely and there's an entertaining degree of shock mixed with dark humour and Christmas gifts to raise a smile and maybe the one hair on the back of your neck towards the denouement. Sure, it's formulaic and there aren't so many surprises, but they are getting better and moving away from the Hammer style of ketchup gore and annoying, hysterical, frat-style characters that we've seen before.

VicSur,9.0,"**How ""Terrifier 3"" Redefines Horror Cinema and Mirrors Societal Anxieties**

**Introduction**
In a cinematic landscape often dominated by high-budget blockbusters and familiar franchises, ""Terrifier 3"" emerges as a remarkable exception. Directed by Damien Leone, this low-budget horror film has defied industry expectations by grossing over $82 million worldwide against a modest $2 million budget. Beyond its financial success, the film offers a profound exploration of psychological fears, societal tensions, and subtle political commentary, redefining the potential of horror cinema in the 21st century.

**A Subversion of Holiday Traditions**
Set against the ironically cheerful backdrop of Christmas Eve, ""Terrifier 3"" subverts traditional holiday themes by delving into the darkest corners of human fear. The malevolent antagonist, Art the Clown - portrayed with chilling intensity by David Howard Thornton - embodies unpredictability and chaos. His reign of terror over Miles County isn't just a series of gruesome events; it's a relentless assault on the notions of safety, normalcy, and the comfort typically associated with the holiday season.

**Psychological Exploration**
At its core, the film is a psychological study of fear and human responses to extreme situations. It taps into Carl Jung's concept of the ""shadow self,"" compelling both characters and viewers to confront the darker aspects of their psyche. Art the Clown is not merely a villain; he represents repressed anxieties and the chaotic potential within society. The notably subdued reactions of audiences - such as the silent screening experiences I experienced in CinemaCity in Romania - highlight the film's ability to reach deep into the subconscious, evoking a primal response that transcends typical cinematic experiences.

**Social Commentary and Contemporary Relevance**
""Terrifier 3"" serves as a mirror reflecting contemporary societal fears. In an era marked by global uncertainties and the erosion of traditional safety nets, the film's disruption of the holiday idyll resonates powerfully. It challenges the illusion of security in familiar settings, suggesting that chaos can intrude upon life without warning. This theme is particularly poignant given current global anxieties related to political polarization, social unrest, and the fragility of societal structures.

**Subtle Political Undertones**
The movie subtly weaves in commentary on the divisiveness and unpredictability that have characterized recent political landscapes, particularly echoing sentiments reminiscent of calls to ""make it great again."" Even it might be a bit of a stretch interpretation it lands very well and align in reality we are today. Art the Clown's embodiment of chaos and his assault on societal norms can be interpreted as an allegory for the breakdown of traditional structures and the rise of polarizing forces. His relentless terror reflects the disruption of established conventions, forcing communities to grapple with unprecedented challenges - a parallel to the societal upheavals experienced during turbulent political times.

The narrative also examines leadership and authority. The inability of societal institutions within the film to contain or comprehend the terror inflicted by Art the Clown mirrors real-world frustrations with ineffective governance in the face of crises. This reflection invites contemplation on how societies become vulnerable when trust in leadership erodes.

_Note: The interpretations presented regarding the political undertones, are my personal opinions and reflections. Don't get to excited! :)_

**David Howard Thornton's Masterful Performance**
Thornton's portrayal of Art the Clown elevates the character from a mere slasher antagonist to a symbol of deeper psychological, social, and political fears. His ability to convey menace without dialogue relies on physicality and expressive nuance, creating a sinister charisma that is both repulsive and captivating. This performance is instrumental in making the film's thematic explorations resonate so profoundly with audiences.

**The Appeal of Extreme Horror**
The film's financial success, despite - or perhaps because of - its extreme gore and brutality, speaks to a cultural fascination with boundary-pushing content. ""Terrifier 3"" taps into the audience's desire for cathartic experiences, offering a space to explore intense emotions and confront the darker facets of humanity. This attraction to extreme horror can be seen as a form of collective processing of fear and uncertainty, providing both an escape from and a reflection of real-world tensions.

**Implications for the Film Industry**
""Terrifier 3"" challenges conventional wisdom in the film industry regarding the profitability and impact of low-budget productions. Its success demonstrates that audiences are hungry for content that is innovative, thought-provoking, and willing to push boundaries. The film exemplifies how strategic storytelling and thematic depth can overcome financial limitations, suggesting a shift in how success can be achieved in cinema.

For filmmakers and industry professionals, ""Terrifier 3"" serves as a case study in leveraging genre conventions to explore complex themes while engaging audiences on multiple levels. It highlights the potential for horror films to transcend entertainment, becoming vehicles for social commentary and philosophical inquiry.

**Conclusion**
""Terrifier 3"" is more than a horror film; it's a bold artistic statement that challenges viewers psychologically, socially, and potentially politically . Damien Leone has crafted a work that is unflinching in its depiction of terror yet rich with depth and relevance. The movie invites audiences not only to experience fear but to question its origins and implications within the context of contemporary society.
As the film continues to captivate and unsettle viewers worldwide, it redefines the potential of horror cinema in the 21st century. ""Terrifier 3"" stands as a testament to the power of storytelling that is unafraid to delve into the complexities of existence, reflecting and challenging the societal and political currents of our times.

RoRo Nereus,3.0,"The third installment of Terrifier promised to surpass the expectations of slasher fans, but unfortunately, it falls short due to a script that loses its way halfway through the movie. What begins as an intriguing narrative with potential to explore Art the Clown’s backstory quickly dissolves into a series of chaotic, disconnected scenes that seem to exist solely to justify the excess of gore.

Character development is practically non-existent, and any attempt to offer a narrative arc is abandoned in favor of an endless parade of graphic violence. While the special effects are impressive and true to the visceral spirit of the saga, it feels like an empty spectacle without a story to support it.

For fans of extreme gore, Terrifier 3 might meet expectations, but even for them, the lack of coherence in the script and the absence of a solid plot might prove frustrating. What could have been an opportunity to take the franchise to new levels of depth and creativity ends up being an exercise in shock for shock’s sake.

In conclusion, Terrifier 3 gets lost in its own excess, leaving viewers with an empty, exhausting experience that, while visually impactful, lacks narrative purpose.",2024-12-27T20:13:01.121Z,1034541,2 stars,0.733241617679596
moviepoptime,-1.0,"Woman of the Hour is a crime thriller genre movie released in 2023, which meteoric rising American actress Anna Kendrick as a film director. True to the fiction of the movie, it was based on the horrifying story of Rodney Alcala, a serial killer to boot who guested in a 1970s show called The Dating Game. The story revolves around Sheryl Bradshaw in her dream to be an actress portrayed by Kendrick just to take Alcala out and eventually be killed by him.

The aspects of the film are related to the themes of misogyny and violence and how women deal with strange men. It captures a form of Alcala’s persona and dolled-out charm graphically presents the interactions he has with his victims, and highlights the various institutional deficiencies that enabled him to continue perpetrating his heinous acts despite complaints lodged against him.

When I looked back at my own life, I could connect to the vulnerability, but also the suspense in some scenes in the movie that might appear completely ordinary from the outside. It is most useful as a caution against the evils of talking to strangers since such incidents are still possible in today’s society.

However, it proves to be a different matter entirely when it tackles the more spooky scenes which had the hallucinatory quality of a fever dream and made the original such a compulsive and memorable viewing experience. It recreates each one of these scenes, but with considerably less effectiveness  (this is in large part due to the noticeable absence of Harry Sukman's superb music to magnify and intensify them) and as a direct consequence of this the scenes in question - Marjorie Glick on a mortician's table rising to join the undead, Mike Ryerson returning from the dead and so on - lack the necessary fear and tension in this latest incarnation which just confirms that Tobe Hooper's version of ""Salem's Lot"" (1979) is still the ultimate in terror.",2024-10-11T02:08:30.323Z,748230,3 stars,0.4645026624202728

MovieGuys,5.0,"For anyone old enough to remember, Coles Notes offered students an accessible summary of famous works, by the likes of Dickens, Shakespeare or Tolstoy. 

Something similar can be said of the latest cinematic iteration of Stephen Kings book, Salem's Lot. This is an abridged version of Kings vampiric tale. It plays out in broad, somewhat hurried, expository strokes, absent the deeper essence of the work. Things happen quickly, at the expense of a slowly established atmosphere of creeping dread, as the viewer comes to see whats really going on, in the rural town, of Salem's Lot. Indeed, the core of what makes this tale so terrifying, is revealed in the opening scenes. 
In short, this is Salem's Lot for the impatient. 

Frankly, the first cinematic production of Salem's Lot, starring David Soul, remains, I believe, by far the best re-imagining of Kings work, to this day.  

In summary, the latest cinematic edition of Salem's Lot is not awful but it rushes through the story, largely spoiling the atmosphere of creeping terror, I believe, is at the bloody heart, of this nightmarish tale.",2024-10-14T20:55:31.947Z,748230,4 stars,0.3941243588924408
CinemaSerf,5.0,"Celebrated author ""Ben"" (Lewis Pullman) returns to his childhood home looking to do some investigations into his own youth when he discovers that there's something distinctly unsavoury going on in the ""Lot"". That all seems to centre around the long abandoned ""Marsten"" house that’s basement has recently received a strange package before a local urchin goes missing. Luckily for our intrepid writer, he has hooked up with ""Susan"" (Makenzie Leigh), somewhat sceptical local doctor ""Cody"" (Alfre Woodard) and with the savvy young ""Mark"" (Jordan Preston Carter) and as it becomes pretty clear what's going on, they have to work out a strategy that will keep them all alive! This, sadly, hasn't an original bone in it's body - falling somewhere between mediocre Hammer and that ""Penny Dreadful"" television series we saw ten years ago. The acting is pretty woeful, but no worse than the overly descriptive dialogue and with the possible exception of the young Carter who at least puts some effort into the proceedings, the rest of this follows all too predictable lines before a denouement that offers us nothing new either. Sure, reinventing this particular wheel is nigh-on impossible, but then why make it? It's not as if it has any sense of menace or peril, there are no gruesome special effects or harrowing scenes of gore and blood-lust; it's more like a series of unfunny comedy sketches set in an eerie scenario where just turning on the light (or not going into the place in the first place) might have been a better solution. It's far too long and slow to get going, and all I can think of really is bring back David Soul.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"I was going to go and see the first Joaquin Phoenix outing as the ""Joker"" (2019) to remind my self of who did what to whom, but I didn't have time. I think I am glad because I recall that being so very much better than this. Here, we pick up after ""Fleck"" (Phoenix) has been on his clown-faced slaughtering spree and is in prison supervised by prison officer ""Jackie"" (Brendan Gleeson). His lawyer ""Maryanne"" (Catherine Keener) is trying to have him declared competent to stand trial for his crimes so she can plead some sort of personality disorder defence - he's not ""Fleck"" when he's the ""Joker"" sort of thing. Thing is, he encounters ""Lee"" (Lady Gaga) at a prison sing-a-long and she manages to ingratiate herself with him and then to derail that plan ensuring the plot twists it's way into the courtroom where his conviction for multiple homicides quickly appears as inevitable as there being a song in the film. Now I did like the soundtrack, but by the way Todd Phillips has presented this, it might as well have been either Tony Bennett or Newley who took on the leading role as her part is largely a series of entertainingly photographed music videos with the thinnest slices of meat constituting a weak story in between. It's a love story, I suppose, but that wasn't really what I turned up to see. There's loads of excess, but no menace or jeopardy and the character's previous adeptness at treading the thin line between sanity and madness isn't really developed at all here. He comes across more as a pathetic, emaciated, prisoner whose flame has well and truly gone out. His legal antagonist (Harry Lawtey) looks about eleven years old but that doesn't really matter either as the judicial proceedings themselves offer us little by way of sustaining drama, even as we build to a denouement that offers the tiniest bit of hope then... It's a stunning piece of cinema, money has been spent and there's imagination a-plenty from the production's designers. It's just too much of a jigsaw of a film with too little plot serving as a vehicle for an album boxed-set that's doubtless ready to hit the shops.",2024-10-05T05:01:49.754Z,889737,3 stars,0.4377579092979431

""Joker: Folie à Deux holds immense technical and artistic merit, but it fails to replicate the success and impact of the original.

Todd Phillips’ boldness in turning the film into a musical is admirable, but the execution ends up being incoherent, with abrupt transitions between the dark drama and the musical numbers, resulting in a jarring experience, made even more frustrating by the studio’s embarrassing secrecy about the movie’s format.

Brent Marchant,5.0,"Combining movie genres can be tricky business. When the mix is right, the outcome can be truly impressive, but, when it’s off, it can spell cinematic disaster. In the case of this long-awaited sequel to the 2019 box office and critically acclaimed success, unfortunately, the result is closer to the latter than the former. Picking up where the protagonist’s story left off, this saga about charismatic villain Arthur Fleck (a.k.a., the Joker) (Joaquin Phoenix) finds him in prison awaiting trial for his string of heinous crimes. Most of the picture’s first half takes place here, an unlikely venue for Arthur meeting the love of his life, the psychopathic Lee Quinzel (a.k.a., Harley Quinn) (Lady Gaga), who diligently stands by her man when he eventually goes to court, the primary focus of the film’s second half. So, at this point, the picture is already part prison film, part courtroom drama and part dark romance. But, if that weren’t enough, writer-director Todd Phillips draws upon a fourth genre – musicals – to make the mix even more overstuffed (but, hey, if you’ve got a talent like Lady Gaga at your disposal, why not, right?). The result is a convoluted, overlong, often-uninteresting offering that’s heavy on style but weak on substance and not especially interesting. Admittedly, the performances of the two leads and many of the supporting players (Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener and Steve Coogan in particular) are quite good, doing a more than commendable job of making this material look far better than it actually is. In addition, stylistically speaking, the picture is terrific when it comes to its production design, costuming and cinematography. And the soundtrack is great, too, including an array of superbly chosen standards to complement the narrative (even if there are a few too many selections). But these strengths by themselves aren’t enough to make a good picture overall; what’s stuck in between these elements feels more like filler than substance, and that’s where the movie falls apart. In my view, “Joker: Folie à Deux” isn’t as resoundingly awful as many reviewers have made it out to be in light of its artistic and aesthetic accomplishments, but that doesn’t mean this release is not without its share of problems, most notably in the dreadful writing and mishandled film editing. This is one of those pictures where you get to the end and are likely to heave a heavy “Ho hum, so what?” And that’s regrettable, given that the character and this picture’s predecessor both deserved better than what this follow-up has to offer. If you haven’t seen this yet, you might be better off sticking to the picture’s genuinely stellar trailer, as that’s ultimately much better than most of what’s found in this clunky 2:18:00 release.",2024-10-06T01:53:04.298Z,889737,2 stars,0.4493464529514313

r96sk,9.0,"Great title, great movie.

I had heard tiny bits about <em>'Joker: Folie à Deux'</em> falling below expectations since its release, though they weren't substantial enough to know if the film was any good or not. I have to say, I really enjoyed watching it all play out. It admittedly isn't on the same level as the phenomenal predecessor, but that's OK - I wasn't expecting it to be.

I will say that making this a musical of sorts was a bold choice, it wouldn't have been the direction that I would've went with it but to be honest I thought they executed it nicely. I presume that is one reason many didn't like this, as well as possibly the lack of craziness that seemed like it was on the horizon based on the 2019 flick. For me, mind, it all works.

Joaquin Phoenix is as excellent as anticipated in his reprisal as Joker, while Lady Gaga is a neat piece of casting for Lee - obviously her music chops for one, though I do enjoy her acting too. Lee perhaps could've been used more, but what we got is more than sufficient in my opinion. Brendan Gleeson, elsewhere, does well in a more minor role.

Is is slightly overlong? Possibly. Did we need a sequel? Probably not. All I can confirm is that I had a positive time viewing it, so I can't harbour any noteworthy complaints. It's a shame to now read that this film has seemingly bombed in more ways than one. C'est la vie.",2024-10-18T01:14:47.727Z,889737,4 stars,0.639681875705719

kevin2019,5.0,"""Joker: Folie `a Deux"" has a variety of reveries based upon Arthur Fleck and Lee Quinzel, but it isn't long before these elaborately staged musical extravaganzas begin to make the entire film resemble some sort of expensive television show starring the one and only Jaoquin Phoenix and his very special guest Lady Gaga. The film certainly provides a superb showcase for the musical talents of them both, but it comes at a price: It is also responsible for side lining the other necessary elements of the film and as a direct result of this what we are lumbered with is essentially a virtually non-existent story the filmmakers have decided to overload with a plethora of musical numbers and HEY, PRESTO! THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT! Well, yes. After a fashion. What is going to happen in the third film it will no doubt be revealed none of this actually happened - which is probably what both audiences and the executives at Warner Bros. are thinking to themselves right this minute, especially in light of the meagre profit this film struggled to scrape together at the box office when compared to the extraordinary success of the original.",2024-12-30T02:02:30.471Z,889737,2 stars,0.38137295842170715
krabat,6.0,"The second Joker movie had a lot to live up to. There was always an underlying tension, which was expected to erupt into chaos and violence at any time. But sadly that moment never came. What was left was the sad story of a mentally ill criminal going through his trial and gaining some hope when falling in love. 

**Beware: spoilers ahead**

Although despised by most of Gotham's citizens, the Joker had a loyal fan-base. Then, later in the movie it gets clearer that those fans were only interested in the monster-part of the joker, but not in his person. When they realized they weren't given the monster, their support and loyalty faded quickly, leaving the Joker alone and devastated.

I think the main idea behind the movie is interesting and engaging, but the execution is way too lengthy. It lacks an action part where the Joker and Harley Quinn drown the city in chaos. The singing scenes were too numerous and his mentally illness may have been expressed better while wrecking the city.

""Megalopolis is an ambitious epic that attempts to examine numerous thought-provoking themes, but Coppola's vision of societal reconstruction reflects both its grandeur and the inherent flaws of its chaotic execution.

Despite immersive visuals and a talented cast, the narrative becomes overloaded with metaphors and philosophical analogies, resulting in an experience that, while provocative, feels confusing and scattered. The central conflict between Cesar and Cicero offers intriguing moments, but the richness of the ideas often gets diluted by the film's excessive complexity.

A frustrating disappointment that, even as the creation of one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, still falls prey to the common pitfalls of contemporary cinema.""

Brent Marchant,5.0,"In the interest of full disclosure, it pains me to write this, but I feel I must be honest. Legendary writer-director Francis Ford Coppola’s long-awaited epic cinematic fable is, regrettably, a major disappointment. After decades of stop-and-start development, the filmmaker’s metaphorical opus about a renowned, idealistic architect (Adam Driver) seeking to build an ambitious utopian development in a modern-day version of New York inspired by ancient Rome follows the protagonist’s often-frustrated efforts to get the project off the ground (not unlike the production of this movie itself). Thematically speaking, the picture addresses a number of thoughtful, significant issues about the roles of greed, corruption, politics and agenda-based motivations in matters of public welfare, as well as the importance of enabling the expression of inspired creative freedom. It also delves into the relevance of love and support in fueling the success of such ventures. However, these notions are severely undermined by an overwhelming abundance of narrative clutter and style over substance. While it’s true that “Megalopolis” is gorgeous to look at with its inventive and impressive cinematography and production design, these visual aspects become so dominant that they vastly overshadow the coherence and intelligibility of the story. Admittedly, a greater sense of clarity begins to emerge as the picture unfolds, but, unfortunately, by that point, it’s difficult to imagine almost anyone genuinely caring about what ultimately happens. There are also many less-than-subtle parallels between the plot of this film and the screen adaptation of author Ayn Rand’s best-selling novel “The Fountainhead” (1949), raising some questions about the authentic originality of this work. Given that this could well be Coppola’s final film, it’s a shame to see the director wind up his repertoire with such a disappointing and underwhelming effort, and some reviewers (myself included) have tried mightily to avoid being unduly unkind, perhaps delivering more generous ratings than might ordinarily be the case. Nevertheless, it would appear that this allegorical undertaking was more than the filmmaker could manage, and it shows in the finished product, quite a letdown from the director known for such classic offerings as “The Godfather” (1972) and “Apocalypse Now” (1979). Yet, if you’re determined to see it, in light of the stunning visuals, this is probably a production best viewed on the big screen, but don’t be surprised if you walk away from this one disappointed overall.",2024-09-28T23:39:10.944Z,592831,2 stars,0.6811851859092712
CinemaSerf,6.0,"So imagine that the Roman Empire survived the turbulent treacheries of the original Caesars and made it to third millennium. (New) Rome has miraculously relocated to the United States (of course the greatest country the world has ever known) and the city is run by mayor ""Cicero"" (Giancarlo Esposito). He's not without his detractors, though, and one of them is the ambitious ""Cesar"" (Adam Driver) who has ambitions to reinvent their city, Nero-style, by demolishing the run down slums and replacing them with an idealistic utopia constructed of his new, eternally lasting, ""Megalon"". The city's vested interests are lined up against this young man though, all except the mayor's daughter ""Julia"" (Nathalie Emmanuel) who has taken a bit of a shine to the ambitious ""Cesar"" - and that's much to the chagrin of his previous squeeze ""Wow"" (Aubrey Plaza) who decides that she will seek some vengeance by marrying the enormously wealthy, and aged, ""Crassus"" (Jon Voight). Add to this already rather cluttered mix, the personality of ""Clodio"" (Shia LaBoeuf) who is determined to bring down ""Cesar"" and see himself in public office - and inherit the ""Crassus"" fortune, and we have the makings of an internecine intrigue that ought to have made Suetonius and Machiavelli blush. Instead, well, we get a rambling drama that hasn't a clue where it's going - nor for whom it is for. It tries to mix a bit of the ancient Shakespeare (and Marcus Aurelius) into the dialogue to lend some gravitas and sense of history to the plot, but for the most part this is just a confused mess of a film. It's a toss up between LaBeouf as the the over-the-top, hammy, ""Clodius"" and Voight's doddery old gazillionaire as to who takes what acting plaudits there might be here, but the rest of the cast look like fish out of (CGI) water and though the production makes the odd to nod to cinema history - there's a tiny bit of Fritz Lang here, I though - the rest of this comes across as an ill-inspired vanity project for Francis Ford Coppola that can't decide if it's ""Romeo & Juliet"" or ""Spartacus"" and in the end doesn't deliver the potency, emotion, intensity or humour of either. It is a good looking film and the production designers have imaginatively created a city-scape that is ripe for the story, it's just that the story isn't ripe for the audience. It does need to be seen on a big screen, but be prepared to be underwhelmed as it starts strongly then simply peters out into a wordy melodrama with a few clumsily delivered messages about the nature of greed and the fecklessness of humanity lightly woven into the weak storyline.

Wuchak,8.0,"**_Colorful, eccentric, intellectually heavy and full of pizazz, but not for the masses_**

A brilliant architect (Adam Driver) is determined to recreate a core section of New Rome in the later 21st century with a revolutionary bio-adaptive material called Megalon. But the new mayor resists these creative plans because he’s content with the way things are (Giancarlo Esposito). As such, the mayor’s not happy when his daughter (Nathalie Emmanuel) starts to develop a relationship with the prodigy. Shia LaBeouf plays a decadent troublemaker while Aubrey Plaza appears as a scheming TV presenter drawn to the financial backbone of the city (Jon Voight). 

Francis Ford Coppola first came up with the idea for “Megalopolis” in 1977. It was inspired by Lucius Sergius Catiline’s failed attempt to take control of the Roman republic in 63 BC, but lost to his rival Marcus Tullius Cicero. Even though Francis compiled hundreds of pages of notes and script fragments for the project in early 1983, the first serious attempt to go forward with making the movie was in 2001-2002, but the production eventually froze for various reasons, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

When Coppola turned 80, he decided to throw caution to the wind and finally make the film, financing it himself at a cost of $120 million, with shooting taking place between November and March, 2022-2023. So, is it any good? Some critics call it a “big mess,” but the plot is actually simple, as detailed above. It’s Francis’ artsy style that throws people off wherein he respects the intelligence of the viewer to put the pieces together. This approach was evident in his previous pictures, like “One From the Heart,” “Rumble Fish,” “Bram Stoker’s Dracula,” “Youth Without Youth” and “Twixt” (aka “B-Twixt Now and Sunrise”). Speaking of those flicks, if you liked any of them, or hated ’em, this is cut from the same artistic cloth.

As observed with “Tucker: The Man and His Dream,” “Tetro” and even “Apocalypse Now” (the character of Kurtz), Coppola likes to parallel aspects of his own life in his movies. Here, he’s Cicero (Driver), an award-winning genius who has an ambitious new project that will revolutionize the landscape if carried out, but those in power oppose his noble efforts. He’s constantly slandered or framed with his indiscretions not helping matters. He’s also troubled by the death of his wife and his unborn children (remember the tragedy of Francis’ eldest son, Gian-Carlo, in 1986?). Yet he presses on with his vision and ultimately changes the world with his art.

At the end of the day, the movie’s entertaining on several fronts and stuffed with quality mindfood, not to mention it has a welcome warmhearted close. I busted out laughing on several occasions in light of the creative madness of it all. For those who say the amusement was “unintentional,” I guess they never saw Coppola’s previous film “Twixt,” not to mention earlier ones like “You’re a Big Boy Now.”

I see the city of Megalopolis as a type of the New Jerusalem in the Bible, the eternal city described in Revelation 21-22 (awesome streets of gold and all that). ""The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life"" and so the impenitent in the movie reap the wages of their transgressions whereas those who change their minds/thinking/actions (that is, they repent) are able to enjoy the benefits of the amazing new city.

If you value it, this is a flick you’ll be able to go back to for gems missed on previous viewings. 

It runs 2 hour, 18 minutes, and was shot in Manhattan and Trilith Studios, Atlanta.

MovieGuys,6.0,"""Wolfs"" is a rather downbeat crime thriller, that doesn't quite make the most of its potential. 

Perhaps, my biggest gripe with this film is it tends to dismiss its actually quite interesting, peripheral characters, in favour of its big stars, in this case George Clooney and Brad Pitt. 

My wife who sat and watched this with me, said in essence it was a dissatisfying experience and I'm inclined to agree. Yes, there are instances in cinema where someone ""steals the show"" with a stand out performance but more typically, its the whole cast who make a film shine. The failure to extend the role of interesting secondary characters is a shame and I, for one, felt this film would have been better, had that been the case. The end results a film that's still quite watchable but also feels somehow abrupt and incomplete. 

In summary, ""Wolfs"" doesn't quite make the most of its potential by making decisions that actually limit the films scope and depth. The results mildly entertaining but by no means remarkable.",2024-12-15T22:43:11.383Z,877817,3 stars,0.5643709301948547

moviepoptime,-1.0,"Never Let Go is a gripping survival thriller directed by Alexandre Aja that combines horror elements with intense family dynamics. My experience watching the film was both engaging and unsettling, as it effectively builds tension throughout.

The story revolves around a mother and her twin sons who must defend themselves against an unspeakable evil threatening their home. The atmosphere is haunting, with stunning visuals that enhance the sense of dread. Aja's direction creates an unnerving world that kept me on the edge of my seat.

While the performances are strong, particularly from the lead actress, I felt that the film struggled in its third act, where some of the tension dissipated and the plot became somewhat predictable. Despite this, the emotional core of the story highlighting the bond between mother and children resonated with me.

Overall, Never Let Go offers a compelling mix of horror and drama, making it a worthwhile watch for fans of the genre, even if it doesn't fully capitalize on its intriguing premise. It left me reflecting on the lengths one would go to protect their loved ones.

Brent Marchant,7.0,"There are times in our lives when nearly all of us exceed the limits of our capabilities (and often quite unexpectedly at that). But that can be a tremendous blessing, especially when we’re confronted by circumstances where such aptitudes are called for. So it is for Roz (Lupita Nyong’o), a robot who inadvertently ends up stranded on a remote island when the vessel transporting her crashes without warning. Roz isn’t alone, though; she finds herself surrounded by a diverse array of forest animals who, curious though they might be, don’t quite know what to make of the mysterious metallic stranger. Meanwhile, the somewhat bewildered new arrival is out of her anticipated element, too, expecting to be in the company of humans for whom she’s been programmed to function as a domestic servant. However, the fundamental disconnect between these parties gradually dissipates as they each get to know one another, particularly when Roz needs to grow beyond her innate programming to overcome a series of challenges and bond with her new organic familiars, most notably a young goose (Kit Connor) whom she’s charged with raising when the gosling’s parents are accidently killed. Before long, Roz develops a sentience that helps her evolve beyond a collection of circuits and microchips, a development that proves valuable in a world beset by even bigger issues. In his latest animated feature outing, writer-director Chris Sanders has created a thoughtful, entertaining tale with an uplifting message we can all draw upon when life ups the ante on us. The picture’s stunningly gorgeous animation, solid writing, and delightfully amusing voiceover performances by the likes of Nyong’o and co-stars Pedro Pascal, Bill Nighy, Mark Hamill, Catherine O’Hara, Ving Rhames and Stephanie Hsu collectively deliver a fine mix of hearty laughs, inspiring insights and touching moments, all without becoming silly or saccharine. Admittedly, the film has a little trouble finding its footing at the outset, and a few story threads feel a little underdeveloped, such as subplots related to important but underexplained environmental themes. What’s more, it can be somewhat mystifying at times trying to figure out exactly who this offering was made for, as the material often comes across as a little more mature and decidedly more intense than what one might expect for younger viewers (despite its adorable depictions of its funny, furry forest creatures). However, these modest shortcomings are more than made up for the further one gets into the story, growing progressively stronger as the narrative unfolds. Most importantly, though, it’s gratifying to see a production that genuinely rises above the low bar that has been set for many releases in this genre these days. “The Wild Robot” is one of those films that’s sure to please a wide range of moviegoers, including those who generally aren’t particularly enamored with animation. It’s a feel-good movie that doesn’t resort to wearing that trait on its sleeve – but that nevertheless achieves such an admirably heartwarming effect anyways.",2024-10-09T13:27:16.982Z,1184918,4 stars,0.5124143958091736

No, of course there's no jeopardy here at all, and at times it's comes across as an amalgam of ""Wall:E"" (2008) with some Hans Christian Anderson thrown in for good measure. That's no bad thing, though, as the characterisation of the android is personable and develops amiably as his programming starts to evolve into something far more akin to a soul than a brain. It does tackle some more serious subjects - loneliness, rejection, isolation and issues with self-esteem to name a few, but always in fashion that illustrates a point then offers some sort of optimism that a solution can be found for even the most difficult challenges. The standard of animation is engagingly natural and it's genuinely quite funny with some of the observations, especially from the fox, working well within the framework of a touching story that extols the values of caring, teamwork and even a little forgiveness, without becoming gloopy or dialogue-heavy.

It's impossible not to empathize with the story and characters as they unfold so brilliantly on screen. Prepare yourself for an emotional journey that hits like a ton of bricks.

With the rise of the Nazis seemingly unstoppable throughout continental Europe, Penrose spends more time on the war effort leaving her more and more determined to prove that she is every bit as capable as her male counterparts. Needless to say there's quite a bit of resistance to her participation in combat zones, but thanks to her own perseverance and an alliance with David Scherman (Andy Samberg) she is soon actively involved in wartime photography and by the end is visiting some of the most ghastly sites ever built seeing, at first hand, the truly stomach-churning atrocities left behind by a now defeated war machine that turned large-scale annihilation into an art form. Her story is being relayed from the comfort of her British home in the 1960s to a man whom we assume is just a journalist. Indeed his obvious nervousness and her antipathetic attitude towards him and his task seems to suggest she sees no value in her memories, but as we develop the threads of her life, we begin to sense that something more exists between her and this young man (Josh O'Connor) which quite neatly puts quite a lot of perspective on the choices made by a woman who probably did put career first. Through the characters of Solange (Marion Cotillard) and Nusch (Noémie Merlant) the film also attempts to put a little meat on the bones of the story of those who had to ""co-operate"" with their new overlords. Some willingly, some less-so and some, well they didn't live to tell. The production and battle scenarios aren't really so effective - maybe just bit too manicured, the script is a little dry and there's maybe just a bit too much of it, but Winslet shows here that she has plenty of capacity to take on a role that it would have been easy to shower with bravado, but instead she brings a more considered charisma to her portrayal of a woman whose bloody-minded courage provided for some of the most significant imagery of the Second World War. Imagery that even now makes your flesh crawl.",2024-09-22T12:06:55.846Z,832964,4 stars,0.7150610089302063

Brent Marchant,7.0,"There are times when many of us feel compelled to pursue something for reasons that we don’t fully understand but that we can’t walk away from, either, no matter what the personal cost may be. So it was for former fashion model Elizabeth “Lee” Miller (Kate Winslet), who, after a successful career of sporting haute couture, became a battlefield photographer for the British edition of Vogue magazine during World War II. Admittedly, she could have enjoyed a life of luxury in her retirement, but she felt a strong need to fulfill a purpose, a decision that led her to willingly immerse herself in this dangerous venture, one in which her life was frequently on the line. However, in doing so, she captured some of the most iconic images of the war in Europe, the stories behind which are recounted and re-created in this engaging biopic from director Ellen Kuras. In chronicling Miller’s life, the film details the hard choices she made, both personally and professionally, as well as her drive to document the hard truth about a conflict for which the world didn’t always have ready access to news about, at least not in the on-demand way we do today. While the picture has a tendency to be somewhat episodic at times, it nevertheless presents a series of intriguing back stories behind a variety of incidents from the storied career of this unlikely but widely regarded journalist. This offering’s fine period piece production design effectively captures the differences between the two diverse worlds in which the protagonist lived – the elegance of high fashion and the gritty wartime landscape – backed by Winslet’s superb performance (a strong awards season contender, to be sure) and the fine supporting portrayals from an excellent ensemble cast, including Andrea Riseborough, Marion Cotillard, Samuel Barnett and a surprisingly effective Andy Samberg. These attributes aside, though, it’s somewhat mystifying how this release came and went from theaters as quickly as it did. “Lee” truly deserved wider attention than it received, but, thankfully, it’s now available for streaming. It takes courage to stick to one’s convictions in a time of combat, especially when the potential cost to oneself is as high as it was for Miller, but the world is better off for her valiant efforts in showing us what we might have missed but about which we all desperately needed to know.",2024-11-22T20:18:52.118Z,832964,4 stars,0.5210351347923279
MovieGuys,4.0,"Certainly not pitched at my age demographic, probably more likely my daughters, to me this seems like your usual dose of somewhat shallow woke-ism. 

I didn't linger too long but what I found ironic is how this film makes a pitch for ""diversity"" which always end up looking like ""conformity"". Join ""tribe"" A (the beautiful brainwashed technocrats) or B (the alleged non conformists agrarians) and its collectivism, not individuality, whichever way you cut it. 

Action is alright, acting is alright and special effects seem reasonable. I think a certain youthful viewer may like it but perhaps fail to appreciate, what's missing from the conversation.  

In summary, I see no overly positive message here. Perhaps aside from a rather simplistic rejection of physiological stereotypes. Whats more important is the right to true individuality, which extends beyond the superficial, to meaningful things like free speech and free expression. Its the loss of these basic freedoms that define us as free thinking unique human beings, in the name of conformity, that's truly ugly.",2024-09-17T08:01:35.051Z,748167,3 stars,0.47724342346191406

I felt unsettled from pretty much the get-go. That's because you can see the general direction that the movie is going to head, though that doesn't hampen the feeling of unease that is present all the way through. I did actually think whilst watching that the film was being a tad dragged out, though by the credits I was fully sold on what I had just seen.

James McAvoy is outstanding, I knew he was capable of portraying such a creepy and unhinged character from seeing some of his other work. <em>'Split'</em> for one, though also, oddly, <em>'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'</em>; I always got creeped out when we first see his Mr. Tumnus.

Mackenzie Davis impresses as well, as do Scoot McNairy and Aisling Franciosi in fairness; youngsters Alix West Lefler and Dan Hough do well too. The final scene with the latter is quite something, I thought it was going to play out slightly differently (i.e. what Ron does to Carl, for any fellow <em>'The Walking Dead'</em> fans) so to see it go they way it did was unexpected - but, without question, welcome.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"How many folks have you met on holiday and promised to go and visit when you all get back home? Well for me that is always a bit like ouzo or metaxa - best enjoyed in situ but never a good idea when the trip is actually over. The ""Dalton"" family are a bit down in the dumps. ""Ben"" (Scoot McNairy) has just relocated to London from the USA to find his job evaporated, wife ""Louise"" (Mackenzie Davis) is trying to keep things positive and their over-indulged daughter ""Aggie"" (Alix West Lefler) is an eleven year old joined (annoyingly) at the hip with her cuddly rabbit.

Initially it's all good fun - even if the sleeping arrangements leave something to be desired, but gradually it becomes clear that all is not as it might be amidst this idyllic setting. When young ""Ant"" manages to convey a menacing secret to ""Aggie"" then a distinct panic sets in amongst the visitors who conclude that a midnight flit is in order. Of course, it's not going to be that easy and adaptability and ingenuity become the family's buzzwords as things become a great deal more dangerous. It does come alive a bit for the last twenty minutes, even though these are all just a little far-fetched, but the rest of this is really little more than a showcase for McAvoy to shine. To be fair, he does turn in a decent enough effort eventually but we spend far too much time building to that denouement. The preamble, some on their holiday and most at their rustic residence all advances the storyline too slowly and meanderingly to sustain enough interest to carry it's almost two hour duration, and personally, I found the likelihood that these people would ever have become friends in the first place about as remote as his house.

Manuel São Bento,7.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://talkingfilms.net/speak-no-evil-review-an-americanized-remake-for-better-and-worse/

""Speak No Evil may not reach the visceral depth of the Danish original, but it offers a more accessible, commercially appealing approach.

The changes in story and tone may divide fans of the 2022 psychological thriller, but there's something to be said about the effectiveness of the stellar performances - James McAvoy is mesmerizing - and the more complex dynamic between the central characters. The thematic exploration of politeness and the pressure to adhere to social norms, even when they conflict with personal safety, remains thought-provoking, though the credit here goes to the original.

For those who prefer a ""softer"" experience in terms of emotional and physical violence, this remake is a valid version that, while not surpassing the original, manages to deliver a distinct experience for the audience. After all, both stories can coexist and appeal to different viewers. Pick your favorite or, better yet, enjoy both.""

CinemaSerf,7.0,"After the original orgasmatron, we find ourselves back at the very start of the transformer's history with all of the ""Prime"" contraptions having been destroyed in a war and now only ""Sentinel Prime"" exists to lead the bots in a self-perpetuating existence of mining for the fuel that allows them to continue to mine for the fuel. You get the drift. Many of the robots don't have the cogs in their chests necessary to do any transforming, and that includes the lively ""Orion Pax"", his pal ""D-16"" and their feisty supervisor ""Elita-1"", but when a series of incidents occur that sees them escape from their mine onto the forbidden surface they discover an whole new truth that questions not just the history that's been drummed into them, but the very integrity of their leadership. Thing is, can they do anything to thwart a dastardly plan the could ensure the bots stay slaves for ever? As origin stories go, this is one of the better ones. Plenty of action throughout sets a story that doesn't rely (too heavily) on your knowledge of the Hasbro universe, it just allows you to root for the good guys as they battle the menacing and overwhelming forces lined up against them to ensure the new status quo endures and the dead stay exactly that. The story deals with the usual aspects of brotherhood, loyalty, ambition and though there's little actual jeopardy throughout - and, less face it, it's part of an ongoing franchise that's going to run, and run, and run - there's plenty to enjoy as it sets the scene for what's to come.

moviepoptime,-1.0,"Transformers One is an animated origin story that offers a fresh take on the beloved franchise. My experience watching it was quite enjoyable, as the film combines stunning visuals with a heartfelt narrative that resonates with both new and longtime fans.

The voice acting is exceptional, bringing depth to characters like Optimus Prime and Megatron. The animation is visually striking, enhancing the action sequences while also allowing for moments of genuine emotional connection. I appreciated how the film explores themes of loyalty, leadership, and compassion, which adds layers to the story beyond just robot battles.

However, while the film is accessible and entertaining, I found that it might not satisfy hardcore fans seeking a deeper lore or complexity. The plot is straightforward, with the Matrix of Leadership serving as a central McGuffin, which may feel simplistic for some viewers.

Manuel São Bento,8.0,"The Substance delivers an intense, visually mesmerizing commentary on the entertainment industry's obsession with youth and outward beauty. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley offer remarkable, maybe even career-best performances, with Dennis Quaid excelling in his role as well. Coralie Fargeat explores how aging stars, particularly women, are discarded when they no longer meet the industry's strict beauty standards. Moore's character, haunted by the memory of her former fame and beauty, goes down a dark path in pursuit of a ""better"" version of herself. The story is also a sharp critique of power dynamics, with white men controlling who's in front of the spotlight, while women are pitted against one another for validation.

The film's production is equally impressive, especially the makeup and prosthetic work that elevates its body horror elements. While the first half of the movie is more subdued, the gore ramps up significantly as the plot unfolds, culminating in a chaotic ""fourth act"" that will leave audiences bewildered. The fast-paced editing, paired with an impactful score, heightens the tension and surrealism of the narrative. Though there's a part of me who prefers a version of the film that ends before the wild final act, the overall experience is an unforgettable, audacious exploration of vanity, control, and desperation in the entertainment world.

good.film,-1.0,"For a film that’s laser-focused on the human body, it’s gloriously on point that THE SUBSTANCE begins with a freshly cracked, bright yellow egg yolk. 

Eggs are the ‘giver of life’, right? They’re the origin of all of us. Gleaming and plump, the yolk suddenly gets pricked – not by a fork, but a syringe.

That’s the first juicy visual metaphor of many in this meaningfully bonkers body horror, for which French filmmaker Coralie Fargeat picked up the prestigious Best Screenplay prize at this year’s Cannes Film Festival.

To call the film ‘bold’ is a weapons-grade understatement. It’s an audacious, jaw-dropping examination of what screens & billboards demand of women (especially as they age), and how laughably impossible it is to meet those demands. Well, if you didn’t laugh, you’d cry. After watching THE SUBSTANCE, you might do both.

Brent Marchant,4.0,"There’s a big difference between being funny and being laughable, yet the latest from writer-director Coralie Fargeat has somehow found a way to be both. After amassing a considerable amount of largely well-earned cinematic goodwill in the film’s opening segments, the picture mercilessly squanders that support in the final act with an overlong, meandering, disgustingly gratuitous and grotesque exhibition of utterly bad taste. This story of an aging actress (Demi Moore) who seeks to revive her career by retrieving some of her lost youth with the aid of an enigmatic injectable follows her grand misadventures when the mysterious substance prompts the emergence of a younger doppelganger (Margaret Qualley), who becomes a Hollywood sex kitten sensation virtually overnight. To make this experimental venture work, however, the two individuals must follow a complex set of rules, dictates that become increasingly difficult to follow as they each vie for their respective shares of attention. And, as this scenario unfolds, tension grows between them, leading to complications and unexpected developments that become progressively harder to manage. But that’s where what works in the film ends. As the story plays out from there, it becomes stupendously absurd, and, even though there are some hearty laughs in this, there are even more ridiculously implausible and unexplained occurrences that try audience members’ patience and tolerance, so much so that I couldn’t wait for this trainwreck to end. In addition to the foregoing shortcomings, the film includes myriad changes in tone, making it difficult to determine whether this is supposed to be a serious thriller or a campy road, very much in the same way as in the incomprehensible French offering “Titane” (2021). It also shamelessly “borrows” elements from other movies in various ways, most notably imagery and narrative references from “The Shining” (1980) and “Young Frankenstein” (1974), costume designs from the “Hunger Games” franchise, and bafflingly inexplicable soundtrack excerpts from films like “Vertigo” (1958). Then there’s the picture’s obvious, heavy-handed message about the perils of misogyny, observations that, as important as they are, could easily stood to have been turned down more than a few notches (yes, we get it already). At the same time, though, there are also some fundamentally innate questions about the narrative that go wholly unanswered, leaving us with numerous head-scratching moments. Sadly, these failings detract significantly from the elements that do work (at least early on in the film), such as the fine performances of Moore and Qualley, the picture’s inventive cinematography, and a central premise that could have made for an engaging story if handled with greater finesse. But these strengths are effectively cancelled by what ultimately results when this release goes off the rails. Indeed, how “The Substance” captured the 2024 Cannes Film Festival award for best screenplay is truly mind boggling. I’m certainly a fan of the weird, wild and wacky, but this release undermines the virtues of those cherished qualities. Regrettably, I was seriously looking forward to seeing this offering, and I was decidedly impressed by what I saw in its opening acts, but that was all wiped out by how this one ultimately played out, a picture that, in the end, ironically relied more on style than “substance.”",2024-09-28T04:58:03.527Z,933260,2 stars,0.45794063806533813

r96sk,9.0,"Certainly an experience!

<em>'The Substance'</em> is <b>a lot</b>. It's one of those sorta movies that I needed to let settle in my mind before I even started to think about reviewing it. I'm not even sure where to start. It's insane from pretty much the beginning to the very end of its 140 minute run time, some scenes are particularly rough to watch unfold!

I think the only body horror flick I've seen up until this point is David Cronenberg's <em>'Crimes of the Future'</em> from 2022, which I found to be solid enough but it came across, at least to me, as a bit too forced for shock value. This 2024 release has plenty of that, if not more, but it somehow feels totally at home with what surrounds it.

The story itself is fascinating, even taking out all the craziness with the gore et al. So by no means is this a film that is style over substance (sorry). It isn't anything actually overly original in terms of the base plotline, though the way it is portrayed and brought to life is astounding - every inch is expertly crafted.

Demi Moore is outstanding in this! I haven't seen her in much, at least anything released post-2002, but here she is top quality throughout. Margaret Qualley is obviously the opposite in terms of the former, though is just as fantastic in regards to the latter - great performance!

VicSur,9.0,"**The Substance (2024)**
A Visceral Exploration of Youth Obsession and the Fear of Time

""The Substance"" is a bold cinematic experience that masterfully resurrects the practical effects of 1980s horror, delivering a visual and auditory feast that is both nostalgic and groundbreaking. Directed with a keen eye for detail, the film delves deep into society's obsession with youth and the inevitable passage of time, offering a thought-provoking commentary wrapped in visceral horror.
The film follows a renowned actress, portrayed by Demi Moore, who grapples with the fear of aging and losing her fame. In a desperate attempt to reclaim her youth, she becomes entangled with a mysterious substance that promises vitality but comes with horrifying consequences. As she navigates this treacherous path, the lines between reality and obsession blur, leading to a descent into madness.
At its core, ""The Substance"" is a critique of the 21st-century fixation on youth over the value of life experience. It echoes themes from classics like ""Death Becomes Her"" and ""The Picture of Dorian Gray,"" highlighting the shame associated with aging and the societal pressure to maintain perpetual youthfulness. The film questions whether society promotes a 'sexy reality' at the expense of genuine substance and wisdom.
The narrative explores the concept of cheating death, not just literally but metaphorically, as a fear of social death—being forgotten or replaced. This is poignantly portrayed through Moore's character, who embodies the desperation of clinging to relevance in a world that idolizes the new and discards the old.

**Practical Effects and Gore**
From the opening scenes, it's evident that the physical effects are a labor of love—a homage to the era before CGI dominated horror. The gore is unapologetically front and center, reminiscent of Cronenberg's ""The Fly,"" pushing the boundaries of on-screen grotesque. The disturbingly realistic blood effects, combined with meticulously crafted sound design, amplify the discomfort, making the audience squirm.

**Color Palette and Visual Aesthetics**
The color palette is meticulously crafted, bathing scenes in hues that evoke unease and familiarity simultaneously. The use of shadows and lighting enhances the suspense, while the wardrobe and costume design serve as narrative devices, illustrating the juxtaposition between youth and age, purity and corruption.

**Performances**
Demi Moore delivers a stellar performance, capturing the vulnerability and desperation of a woman battling the relentless march of time. Her portrayal adds depth to the film's themes, embodying the internal decay and obsession manifesting physically through the substance. The supporting cast also contributes significantly, with each character representing different facets of society's views on youth and aging.

**Critique**
While the film excels in many areas, it isn't without flaws. The ending feels abrupt, leaving several narrative threads untied, which may leave some viewers unsatisfied. Additionally, the persistent focus on teen emotional states can be grating, potentially alienating those seeking a more mature exploration of the presented themes.

**Engaging with the Hype**
""The Substance"" has generated significant buzz online, sparking discussions about its innovative use of practical effects and its deep societal commentary. The hype seems to stem from both horror enthusiasts who appreciate the throwback to classic techniques and audiences resonating with its timely themes. However, it's worth considering whether the film is merely feeding into the very cycle of superficiality it aims to criticize.


""The Substance"" is a visceral commentary on the fear of aging, the obsession with youth, and the inevitable march of time. It challenges viewers to reflect on their perceptions of age, experience, and what truly holds value. By drawing parallels with films like ""Gremlins,"" ""Frankenstein,"" ""A Christmas Carol,"" and ""Carrie,"" it positions itself as a modern amalgamation of timeless themes.
Despite its imperfections, the film succeeds in sparking conversation—a hallmark of impactful cinema. It's as uncomfortable as it is thought-provoking, demanding to be felt and discussed. Whether you love it or hate it, ""The Substance"" is a noteworthy addition to the horror genre that holds up a mirror to society's own fears and obsessions.

**Extra Thoughts**
- The film raises pertinent questions about our role in perpetuating the fear of aging. Are we complicit in creating a world where experience is devalued?
- The character dynamics suggest that embracing change and maintaining balance might be key to a fulfilling life, even if it comes at a cost.
- The hype surrounding the movie could reflect its resonance with audiences grappling with similar fears and obsessions in today's youth-centric culture.

**Final Recommendation**
""The Substance"" may not offer all the answers, but it provides a platform for dialogue on important societal issues. Its blend of classic horror techniques with contemporary themes makes it a film worth experiencing. If you're a fan of thought-provoking horror that goes beyond mere scares, this movie deserves a place on your watchlist.",2024-11-15T20:31:22.188Z,933260,4 stars,0.5538694858551025
MovieGuys,7.0,"""The Substance"" is something of a cinematic mash up. 

First off, this story is somewhat  reminiscent of ""Death Becomes Her"". The 1992 film starring Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn and Bruce Willis. 

The notion of the fatal conceit in the search for eternal youth amongst the ageing Hollywood set is very much central to the story in both films.

That said, the handling is distinctly different. This film is a lot louder, gaudier, brasher, cruder and ruder, than its 90's counterpart by a country mile. There are elements I'd typically associate with Lovecraft too, that are grotesque, monstrous and disturbing. 

This work is also more a visually clever, as opposed to a compelling narrative based experience. Its messages are conveyed, like Hollywood itself, through larger than life youthful glitz and glamour but also an innate, ephemeral shallowness.A shallowness that becomes a kind of obsessive prison, denying those trapped in it, any meaningful form of human intimacy.

My only criticism of what I do feel is a very good film, is it overplays its hand. Its so over the top in the latter part of the film, I felt it partly drowned out the message, it had, up to that point, convincingly conveyed. The closing scenes. in particular, felt crude, clumsy and would have worked considerably better, with more controlled and subtle, handling. 

In summary, ""The Substance"" is a rather clever film that uses the eye of the lens to expose how what we see, in Hollywood at least, is more important than who we are. People are shiny commodities to be replaced when the beautiful image they portray starts to wither away. As we see, youth and beauty is everything, no matter the price. 

I will say too, this is by no means a perfect cinematic experience. It can be over the top, especially in the latter part of the film. That said, there is, on balance, more to like here than not. Definitely worth a look.",2024-12-05T07:30:01.455Z,933260,3 stars,0.44731074571609497
RalphRahal,2.0,"A disaster. It's an insult to the illustrious careers of Demi Moore and Dennis Quaid, who both deserve far better.

The film focuses too heavily on the body of Margaret Qualley's character, Sue, at the expense of delivering a meaningful story or message. The gratuitous gore towards the end seems to be an attempt to align with current trends, but it falls flat.

However, while it’s bold and at times deeply unsettling, it doesn’t quite achieve that elusive ""perfectly balanced (as all things should be, cit.)"" quality.
The narrative occasionally stumbles, with gaps that detract from its overall impact.
It’s thought-provoking but not groundbreaking — a film that’s above average, yet just shy of excellence.

""Beetlejuice Beetlejuice captures the original's magic but stumbles over its narrative ambition.

Tim Burton manages to maintain the visual charm and peculiar atmosphere that captivated so many viewers, with the cast fully embodying both new and classic characters. However, the narrative structure, overloaded with characters and subplots, leads to some disenchantment, and the dance sequences don't quite reach the level of its predecessors.

That said, there's still lots of joy and fun in reuniting with Betelgeuse and the bizarre world he inhabits, as well as enjoying Danny Elfman's unforgettable score. Excellent for watching with the family!""

tmdb51616167,8.0,"Without revealing any spoilers, I want to share my thoughts on the sequel titled Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.

Originally released in 1988, this sequel maintains the same humorous tone as its predecessor. It offers a blend of cheesy charm and new characters that bring fresh energy to the screen.

The nod to Charles Deetz in the film was both clever and funny, seamlessly incorporating the character despite the actor's passing. The filmmakers managed to pay tribute to the original while staying true to the comedic essence established by Tim Burton in 1988.

Michael Keaton reprises his role as Beetlejuice with impeccable comic timing and character evolution. While he may have put on a few pounds, his performance remains as entertaining as ever. Winona Ryder shines in her lead role, transitioning from her role in ""Stranger Things"" seamlessly.

Jenna Ortega delivers a standout performance, embodying her character with skillful development. Surprisingly, Willem Dafoe's character, whom I initially had reservations about, turned out to be quite comical and well-executed. Bob's appearance in the film is endearing, and his character is sure to win hearts.

Fans will likely be clamoring for Beetlejuice baby toys after watching the film. One minor disappointment was a particular wedding scene that felt overly drawn out and reminiscent of the 1980s era. It could have benefited from some editing to avoid dragging on.

I missed seeing Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis make even a brief cameo in the film, given their absence was noticeable. The digital recreation of the sandworm from 1988 was enjoyable, but the 2024 version lacked the same charm, coming off as cheesy rather than exciting.

The buildup surrounding Dolores, a new character, was intriguing but fell short in the climax, leaving me wishing for a more impactful resolution. Despite this, considering the 35-year gap between the original and the sequel, the film holds up decently.

Overall, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice offered a fun and laughter-filled experience. I recommend watching it in theaters to appreciate its entertainment value. It's a worthy sequel that captures the essence of the original while introducing new elements. So, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!",2024-09-07T02:08:07.646Z,917496,3 stars,0.47555309534072876
Brent Marchant,6.0,"Recapturing the sparks of brilliance that made a movie a screen classic is a tall order to fill, to be sure. It can be difficult to work the same magic a second time, especially if the first effort was so eminently memorable. And, when the sequel in which that second sought-after lightning strike takes 36 years to come into being, the chances of realizing that level of success once more can be even slimmer. So it is with this long-awaited follow-up to director Tim Burton’s 1988 classic horror spoof, “Beetlejuice.” It’s an offering that, despite some flashes of inspired lunacy, significantly pales by comparison. To begin with, the film gets off to an incredibly dull start; it took me almost 45 minutes before I even cracked a smile (though I’ll admit the humor comes along at a more sustained pace from this point onward). Then there’s the picture’s convoluted plot, which has several story threads that could have easily been pared back, if not eliminated entirely (never mind the fact that this offering’s predecessor suffered somewhat from the same problem, though not nearly to the same degree as here). And then there’s the sometimes-disjointed narrative, which could have used some tidying up in spots, particularly when it comes to the inclusion of bits that work but that don’t seem to bear any meaningful correlation to one another. To its credit, however, the picture features the same stellar production design that distinguished the original, smatterings of raucous humor that genuinely echo the first film, and fine performances by its three principals – Michael Keaton, Winona Ryder and Catherine O’Hara – who effectively re-create the iconic characters they portrayed previously. However, many of the new cast members brought on board for this installment (Justin Theroux, Willem Dafoe and Monica Bellucci in particular) add little to the production, serving as disappointing reminders of those who are missing this time around (most notably Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin, Sylvia Sidney and Glenn Shadix). In many regards, I honestly must admit that this release’s shortcomings don’t surprise me that much, as they’re typical of so many of the other lackluster attempts that have been made at reviving numerous classic movies and television series (though I was hoping that a filmmaking talent as gifted as Tim Burton might defy those odds with this offering). It’s undeniable that a small dose of heartwarming nostalgia can be a pleasant tonic for those who could stand to have their spirits lifted a bit, but don’t expect some kind of miracle cure from this one – the medicine needs to be stronger to accomplish that, and this remedy simply isn’t up to it.",2024-09-07T23:16:19.617Z,917496,4 stars,0.49593573808670044
GenerationofSwine,10.0,"Well it's 2024, and that means that movies like this get a 10 of 10 even though back in the 90s, 00s, 80s, they would get maybe a 5/10.

The good news is, save a mention of meh, Climate Change it is basically Meh politics free.  There is no lecturing.  It makes no attempt to shame the audience for being male, straight, white, Christian, or Jewish. All it does is try and entertain the viewer... and I appreciate that.

And, honestly, I can see Ortega as Ryder's daughter.  I really can.  I know there's a racial thing going on there but, honestly, personality wise, it was really the perfect casting.  Especially for her daughter in the Beetlejuice world.  It was just spot on casting and though Ortega doesn't do a 1:1 capture of Ryder's attitude in the first movie, she is close enough where I'm primed to believe it.

However... the red pen is your friend.  Bellucci should have ended up on the cutting room floor, you didn't need that plotline.  Dafoe should have been rewritten to exclude the Bellucci line.  The focus should have just been on Ortega and Ryder and the Deetz family again.

It tried to do too much and the result was that you didn't really become invested in any of the plots.

But, again, in 2024 eyes, it's a good flick compared to the political crap everyone else is making.",2024-09-08T14:03:33.407Z,917496,4 stars,0.45417165756225586
CinemaSerf,6.0,"""Lydia"" (Winona Ryder) has made a good living from her ghost-hunting style books and broadcasts much to the sceptical chagrin of her teenage daughter ""Astrid"" (Jenna Ortega) but they have to try to get on for the funeral of ""Charlie"" who was married to their mother/grandmother ""Delia"" (Catherine O'Hara). Meantime, in the underworld ""Delores"" (Monica Belluci) has quite literally stapled herself back together and is bent on reuniting with her eponymous husband (Michael Keaton) but he's les than enthusiastic at the prospect. Luckily, the young ""Astrid"" meets the handsome ""Jeremy"" (Arthur Conti) and before we know it, she has opened a portal to the nether world that soon has her mother racing around to rescue her from eternal damnation whilst the opportunistic stripey fellow tries to use that predicament to keep himself from his ruthless spouse who is leaving an increasingly gruesome trail of carnage for TV detective ""Wolf"" (Willem Dafoe) to sort out. There are plenty of enjoyable enough shenanigans going on as this quickly paced film knits these threads together, but somehow I found it all just a bit too flat. Like an ""Addams Family"" film that's over-written and doesn't feature anything like enough of Keaton or Dafoe and features way too much of Ortega's typically teenage character whom Hades probably wouldn't have wanted. It does rally well at the end with help from a big cake and the dulcet tones Richard Harris - great to hear that with cinema sound again, but aside from a characterful effort from O'Hara this didn't really want me saying his name once let alone thrice. It's fine but hasn't much spark.",2024-09-10T05:26:23.099Z,917496,3 stars,0.7391484379768372
r96sk,7.0,"An enjoyable second helping of <em>'Beetlejuice'</em>.

<em>'Beetlejuice Beetlejuice'</em> isn't far adrift the original, even if I'd still rank the first film higher. I gotta say those behind this did a good job with the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6yDanmWI1E"" rel=""nofollow"">teaser trailer</a>, I hadn't even seen the 1988 flick but that got my interest. Speaking of trailers, I'm glad they changed that cringey pilates instructor line for Astrid - right call!

Michael Keaton remains the best cast member, though Winona Ryder and newcomer Jenna Ortega are not far off. Willem Dafoe doesn't feature much but naturally still manages to be one of movie's strong points. Justin Theroux's character didn't really do anything for me, while Monica Bellucci feels a little underused but perhaps not; what we get from her as Delores is still decent and arguably enough.

Sounds like Tim Burton doesn't want to another sequel, which is probably for the best but if the studio wanted to go behind his back I, I'm afraid, would have to allow it on this occasion strictly for the obvious title possibility.

kevin2019,8.0,"""Beetlejuice Beetlejuice"" is wise not to take any liberties with the already well established traits of some characters. Lydia Deetz is a case in point. She now hosts a television show devoted to all things paranormal. This film also easily recreates the look of the original and who would have ever believed such a thing was even possible 36 years after ""Beetlejuice"" was first unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1988. This superior sequel is fast paced fun from the very start and it has plenty to say for itself in the most colourful and typically crazy terms imaginable. The bizarre visual effects are splendid, the recreation of the surreal afterlife is marvellous, and it all adds up to an impressive and above all a highly recommended film.",2024-12-25T03:52:40.518Z,917496,5 stars,0.5237479209899902
Sejian,10.0,"Unless I'm mistaken, John Boyega was supposed to have the lead role in this but it went to Aaron Pierre instead. I'm glad he got the role cause I really liked him in it. I hope we get him in more action roles in the future.

There are three things I quite liked in this, besides the action:

1. We know this guy is meant to be an ex-marine because of the tagline but they make it seem like he's into some shady shit at the beginning of the movie, and no, I don't mean when he was detained at the very start. It was fun.
2. Being a woke AF anti-theist (that's someone opposed to organized religion) I really liked the line: ""I don't know enough about the afterlife to trust in it, so while I'm here, [...] I gotta haunt these motherfuckers myself."" That line was hard.
3. The ending. They were building up to it throughout various scenes and I enjoyed watching it play out. I hope that was sufficiently vague enough to not spoil it.

I initially rated this 8 stars with a favorite, but to offset those irrational 1 star ratings, I'm gonna give it 10. I can understand 5 stars and up, but I can't understand 2 and 1.

MovieGuys,4.0,"I waited at least 30 minutes into this tedious affair, wanting something, anything, to happen. When it finally did, it wasn't overly inspiring. Thereafter, it was like a car with a stuck accelerator, start, stop, repeat until the last fourth of this film, when something exciting ""finally"" does  happen. By then, I'll wager many viewers will have simply given up. Guess I'm a naive optimist.....  

Why, why, why can't we have decent scripts, Netflix? Could it be you are too busy woke messaging? One of the characters talks about lynching the main character and the main character, in turn, comments on how the black police officer has an inferior police car, compared to her white counterparts. 

In reality, I do believe there's a genuine problem with policing and not just in the US either. Statistically more white Americans are killed by police every year than black, so its fair to say, its a problem for ""everyone"".

That said, like a lot of people, I look to entertainment to escape the world's misery and divisive politics, not have it thrust in my face, over and over again.  

In summary, on first inspection, Rebel Ridge, has all the hallmarks of an updated Rambo style action flick backed by a strong cast. I was genuinely excited, until I saw the final, dull, lecturing product.

Mister BLAQK,7.0,"At its core, Rebel Ridge is a familiar story: a lone hero against a corrupt system. Yet, Saulnier's deft direction and a strong, well-developed narrative set this film apart. The film begins with a seemingly simple premise: a former Marine, Jeremiah Carter (Pierre), returns to his hometown to help his cousin post bail. However, a series of unfortunate events leads to a confrontation with the local police department, which quickly escalates into a full-blown rebellion against the town's corrupt power structure.

Pierre delivers a tour-de-force performance as Jeremiah Carter. His portrayal of a man driven to desperation by injustice is both powerful and heartbreaking. Carter is a complex character, a man haunted by his past who is forced to confront the darkness within himself to protect those he loves. Pierre's physicality and intensity are matched only by his ability to convey a deep emotional vulnerability.

Rebel Ridge is a film that feels incredibly timely. The themes of police brutality, systemic racism, and the abuse of power are explored with a raw honesty that is both disturbing and cathartic. Saulnier's direction is unflinching, capturing the violence and brutality of the film's world without resorting to gratuitous gore.

While the film's pacing may feel a bit uneven at times, the final act is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion. The film's climax is a tense and suspenseful showdown that has you on the edge of your seat. The film's ending is both hopeful and tragic, a bittersweet reminder of the enduring power of the human spirit.

Rebel Ridge is a powerful and thought-provoking film that deserves to be seen. It is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Aaron Pierre's performance is nothing short of extraordinary, and Jeremy Saulnier's direction is masterful. If you are a fan of gritty thrillers with a strong social message, Rebel Ridge is a must-see.",2024-09-08T16:26:20.564Z,646097,4 stars,0.5178083777427673

CinemaSerf,6.0,"I think the best plan of attack for this film is to forget all about Brandon Lee's 1994 version and treat this as a stand-alone vehicle for Bill Skarsgård to show off his ninja skills. He's ""Eric"" who encounters ""Shellly"" (FKA twigs) and is then promptly embroiled in the devilish machinations of ""Roeg"" (Danny Huston) who ensures that his hench-woman ""Marion"" (Laura Birn) kills them both. Turns out, though, that ""Eric"" still has enough purity of soul left to return to the land of the living and so long as he is touched by true love's kiss sort of thing, will remain immortal long enough to avenge the couple. Yes, there is a crow - the embodiment of his spirit when he goes on his murderous spree, but that whole theme isn't at all developed so let's just forget about that and revert to the whole point of the film - an excuse to pack loads of slaughter, acrobatics and dark, eerie photography into all but two hours of repetitious mediocrity. The camera likes Skarsgård well enough, and there's certainly plenty of him to see here as he takes on all comers. Why were they killed though? Who is ""Roeg""? Sure, you can put your own interpretation onto the story if you can be bothered, but director Rupert Sanders has almost entirely focussed on the gloomy and very wet imagery and decided against putting any meat on the bones of the story or the characters. There's a welcome paucity of dialogue throughout and FKA clearly twigged there wasn't much for her to do here so leaves much of the film to her co-star trying his best to be an amalgam of ""John Wick"" and ""Selene"" from ""Underworld"" (2003). It does look good but hasn't an original feather in it's body. It's nice to see Josette Simon (remember ""Blake's Seven""?) on the big screen, albeit briefly, but this is really all very disappointing.",2024-08-29T07:30:40.056Z,957452,2 stars,0.5601019859313965

Still, this version of the highly regarded 1994 picture isn't all that, I'm afraid. it almost feels like something completely different, they could've altered a few minor things and made an entirely original film to be honest.

MovieGuys,2.0,"WOW this is awful. I remember the original Crow film with Brandon Lee (who sadly passed away making the film), which was reasonable but this so called remake, is, simply put, a cinematic train wreck. 

Eric (The Crow) is, it seems, not really the main character (he's elbowed aside by his drug addict, criminally linked, ex prostitute girlfriend). Apparently Eric, not to be entirely outdone however, is also a drug addict. Both he and the upcoming love interest attend a drug rehab centre, where everyone dresses like extra's from a Pink Panther movie. Oh and poor Eric's a wuss, who's bullied until he and his lady friend escape, have a tryst and are promptly croaked by some bad guys, who are after his dodgy lady friend. At this point and for reasons that seem, to say the least, far fetched, Eric is resurrected, as a mostly inept, anti hero tasked with seeking revenge. 

Suffice to say, this remake is filled with characters who are deeply unlikable and a central plot that's not only weak tea but make's little rational sense. Backed by a so called love story, that's about as appetising, as a two week old bowl of clam chowder.

In summary, the original The Crow film from way back when is a cinematic masterpiece, when compared to this dismal retake. In my opinion, one to avoid.",2024-09-14T00:16:32.593Z,957452,1 star,0.8154215216636658

It's got something of the Agatha Christie meets ""Glass Onion"" to it, this - and for maybe the first half hour is quite intriguing, but once the story gets into gear it just becomes too implausible. Sure, it plays to vanity and the readiness of folks to believe what clearly is too good to be true, but as the story builds to a denouement there is one whopping great Achilles' heel in the premiss that even the occasional presence of his perma-ditzy assistant ""Stacy"" (Geena Davis) can't rescue. It's a good looking drama, but the acting is as unremarkable as the dialogue and though I did quite like the irony of the final conclusion, the plot is just way too thin as we work our way there. This is typical summertime cinema fayre that tries to mix comedy with thriller but in the end just looks like a good excuse for Tatum, Slater et al to have some fun in the sun.",2024-08-29T08:23:35.264Z,840705,3 stars,0.5680859684944153
r96sk,9.0,"Great movie!

<em>'Blink Twice'</em> manages to create high intrigue, an unsettling tone and is very stylishly put together, eventually showcasing some thoroughly enjoyable and visually pleasing violence towards the end. Naomi Ackie and Channing Tatum are both terrific, Ackie is particularly top notch. Nice to see Geena Davis involved too, not seen her since the days of <em>'Stuart Little'</em>! The rest of the cast are all good value, especially Adria Arjona.

I'd admit that it isn't the most unique picture, there are remnants of other productions scattered in there - <em>'Don't Worry Darling'</em> for one,  bit of <em>'Glass Onion'</em> as well as basically any Jordan Peele flick. Still, I had a real fun time watching it all unfold on the big screen so I truly can't leave any complaints.

good.film,-1.0,"Zoë Kravitz's BLINK TWICE is a startling thriller, but that’s just the sheep’s clothing around this dark moral exposé. The real wolf is the urgent assault story lying underneath. It’s a stinging and significant shock that rubs salt into an open wound (and slaps awake the ‘not ALL men!’ crowd). 

So how does Blink Twice explore sexual assault? What does it have to say about money and power? And is THAT rumour about its original title ACTUALLY true?

tmdb51616167,8.0,"In a surprising turn of events, Channing Tatum takes on a new role in the horror genre in the upcoming thriller ""Blink Twice"". Directed by his girlfriend Zoe Kravitz, this film will have audiences on the edge of their seats, trying to decipher the mystery unfolding on a secluded island where women and a young man have been taken.

The luxurious setting, mouth-watering food, and extravagant hospitality all seem too good to be true, leading to a suspenseful tale that keeps viewers guessing until the very end. Without giving away any spoilers, it's safe to say that the plot is intricately woven, the direction is top-notch, and the climax is sure to leave you speechless with a jaw-dropping twist.

As the story delves into dark and unsettling territory, drawing parallels to real-life events like those surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's island, it becomes clear that ""Blink Twice"" is not just your average thriller. It sheds light on the horrors that can lurk beneath the surface of seemingly idyllic settings, making it a chilling reminder of the dangers that can exist in the shadows.

While the subject matter may be disturbing, the film itself is a well-crafted piece of cinema, skillfully executed and guaranteed to leave a lasting impact on its audience. So buckle up for a wild ride with Channing Tatum in a role you never saw coming, and prepare to have your perception of him as an actor forever changed.",2024-09-02T19:06:14.482Z,840705,4 stars,0.6970219612121582

VicSur,8.0,"**""Blink Twice"" and You’ll Miss a Stunning Directorial Debut from Zoë Kravitz**

Zoë Kravitz has officially entered the world of directors with Blink Twice, and her debut is nothing short of brilliant. She reimagines the Final Girl trope in a fresh, bold way, giving us an excellent blend of suspense and smooth storytelling. Kravitz's mastery of narrative pacing and visual tension makes it clear she’s not just dabbling in directing—she’s making waves. This debut film is the perfect example of a director with vision, confidence, and originality.

And then there’s Channing Tatum. WOW! His performance is absolutely jaw dropping, showcasing a range we haven’t often seen from him. Tatum seamlessly moves between charm, vulnerability, and intensity, pulling the audience into every scene. It’s one of his most transformative roles yet, proving he’s more than capable of delivering deeply emotional, dynamic performances.

**The Big Idea: Forgetting vs. Happiness **
Zoë also takes us deeper with her thought-provoking theme of ""Forgetting to Move On."" Rather than promoting the idea that forgetting brings happiness, she questions whether holding onto memories, even painful ones, can make us stronger. It echoes the often misattributed quote: “Happiness is good health and a short memory.” Kravitz challenges that idea, making us think twice about how we process the past.

**KUDOS to Naomi Ackie **
Naomi Ackie delivers a grounded, powerful performance that perfectly complements the film’s intensity. She adds emotional depth to every scene she’s in, capturing the complexities of her character without overplaying it. Ackie’s natural talent shines, and her performance is definitely one to watch.
Don’t miss out on this unforgettable cinematic experience—Blink Twice will leave you reflecting long after the credits roll.",2024-11-15T20:42:52.606Z,840705,4 stars,0.49459853768348694

""The Deliverance holds significant narrative potential but gets lost in a failed attempt to balance serious family drama with absurd supernatural horror. What could have been a thematically powerful movie gradually turns into an awkward and, at times, unintentionally comedic experience.

Despite notable performances from Andra Day and Glenn Close, Lee Daniels fails to build an immersive atmosphere and maintain the narrative cohesion necessary to create a memorable story, leaving the sense that its impact could have been much greater if it had opted for a more restrained, less formulaic approach.""

Unfortunately, it fell short. Daniels relied on the same tired demon tropes that we've seen countless times, making the movie predictable and uninspired. Despite having an overqualified cast, the film suffered from a lack of funding, resulting in a subpar exorcism movie that ended up more depressing than terrifying.

Megan Fox's portrayal of an android is fabulous, bringing a captivating blend of stoicism and subtle emotion to her role. While the plot may come across as somewhat predictable and the story lacks a bit of depth, the film still manages to deliver an engaging experience. The emotional disconnect between the other actors and the audience is palpable, making it difficult to fully invest in their characters. Interestingly, this detachment actually works in favor of the narrative, leading viewers to root for the android.

Leno,5.0,"The movie has an interesting premise, situated in a near-term future where AI androids got so competent that they are pervasive and displaced pretty much all human work force.

While the world-building is interesting and primarily focus on the lives in a family, where the husband inadvertently caused his domestic robot to unbalance her goals towards making him ""calmer"" and ""happier"" over everything else, it also brings deeper elements for a reflexion on the effects in the work force and society once robots start replacing humans in work activities.

However, the premise for a blockbuster could not compensate a weak screenplay, at first excessively slow, and in the later parts of the movie unrealistic. Also, excepted a few actors doing a good job as bots (including Megan Fox), the acting from the human characters is overall awful, especially Michele Morrone's.

The overall acting was mediocre at best. Behaviors and reactions are too often cringy, unconvincing or eyerolling predictable. It's rare for me to ffwd scenes during a movie while watching, but I did here and there.

I was hopeful that the mother Maggie would be killed off at some point (I've hated madeline zima ever since Californication), but alas. Alice (megan fox) was nice to look at. But totally unconvincing as an android. She'd make an excellent emotionless psychopath, though.

tmdb51616167,8.0,"Ending my day with one last movie, I stumbled upon a film titled ""Strange Darling."" A psychological thriller revolving around a mass serial killer, I had no prior knowledge of its storyline. Without watching a trailer or reading a description, I decided to dive right in.

As the movie unfolded, I found myself completely absorbed in its narrative. The plot kept me on my toes, constantly questioning the identity of the serial killer. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, I was either right on the money or completely off track. The film demanded my full attention to catch the subtle clues and details.

While I found ""Strange Darling"" to be a decent watch and appreciated it for what it was, I don't think I would revisit it. The movie delved into gruesome and heavily exploited sexual themes, making it unsuitable for younger audiences. However, I could see why critics and viewers were praising it - the film's psychological thrills and twisted tale of a serial killer kept me guessing until the very end. Though I initially guessed wrong, once the pieces fell into place, the entire story made perfect sense.",2024-09-01T22:41:27.478Z,1029281,4 stars,0.4086047410964966
CinemaSerf,7.0,"A woman runs across a field, blood gushing from her ear. She's being chased by a man with an high powered rifle. Can she escape? Well across the next ninety minutes, and via six chapters and an epilogue, we are told the story of just how we got here. Except, the episodes are not shown to us in numerical order and this isn't the end. It's not really the beginning of the end, but maybe the end of the beginning? Willa Fitzgerald looks terrified, Kyle Gallner looks menacing - but as this cat and mouse game progresses our expectations of the narrative are well and truly challenged, and that proves especially perilous for just about everyone that either of these two characters meet as plenty of uses for handcuffs are demonstrated - none of which were probably as advertised on the box! It doesn't actually take you too long to figure out what is happening, especially as the opening slide reveals it's historical source and so does impact on the jeopardy a little. That said, though, there's a gently seedy eroticism running through this drama and there's also quite an entertaining chemistry between the two characters that, like quite a lot of this film, invites us to reconsider established sexual stereotyping. It's violent at times, bloody too - but in the vein of Hammer rather than Tarantino and it's tongue is in it's cheek for a fair chunk as it evolves. If you get a chance to see in the cinema, the give it a go - it almost certainly won't pan out as you'd expect.

r96sk,8.0,"Visually, <em>'Strange Darling'</em> is a treat.

It's an extremely stylish movie, the film features some excellent shots as well as great music. I'm not fully sold on the base story, I feel like if you stripped every other element back then you'd be left with a real mid plot. On the other hand, though, when all is said and done I think I did get a good amount of entertainment from it.

I don't believe it needed to be told in nonlinear order, you could've portrayed events more traditionally and I don't think it wouldn't changed much (if anything) in terms of the viewing experience. With that said, it is easy to keep up with the jumps and it doesn't hinder the flick whatsoever. So, I guess, if it works, why not?

The performances of Willa Fitzgerald and Kyle Gallner are excellent, to be fair. They both fit their respective roles and each play their part in keeping the movie marching along nicely. The support cast merit relative praise as well, notable to see Ed Begley Jr. and Steven Michael Quezada involved - a <em>'Better Call Saul'</em> reunion, of sorts.

The film's use of non-linear chapter framing was intriguing and innovative, showcasing Mollner's talent for delivering the emotional depth of each scene. He adeptly balanced the timeline with the message each chapter conveyed. However, the plot lacked direction at times, diverging into unintended paths, which slightly hindered the overall narrative. Giovanni Ribisi's cinematography was nothing short of phenomenal, capturing each moment with precision and artistry. The lead actors, Willa Fitzgerald as ""The Lady"" and Kyle Gallner as ""The Demon,"" delivered outstanding performances that truly brought their characters to life.

r96sk,8.0,"<em>'Alien: Romulus'</em> is actually very good.

Of the more modern day releases from this franchise, this is the one I've enjoyed the most. When I was immediately coming out of the cinema I was just plainly thinking of it as being solidly good, however the more I think about it the more I had fun with this seventh installment.

The plot, or at least the set-up to it, is quite uncreative, as in I feel like so many films - from this series included - have a crew make-up of similar people and similar characteristics/motivations; <em>'Crater'</em> and <em>'I.S.S.'</em> (both very good, don't get me wrong) are recent examples that spring to mind. Happily, though, the rest of the flick makes up for any weakness in that area.

Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson are the great performers in this, I found them both to be excellent throughout. Two actors I want to see much more of, having already seen them in a few pleasing pictures; e.g. <em>'Civil War'</em> and <em>'Rye Lane'</em>.

I also liked the sound design and even the jump scares, which I'm not usually a fan of (bit lazy etc.) but there is enough about how they do them here that it works. Those facehuggers remain brilliantly effective, though the xenomorph isn't amazingly utilised - the human version didn't hit for me, felt <em>'I Am Legend'</em>-esque.

All in all, it's up there as one of my favourites from the franchise. For me, <em>'Alien'</em> and <em>'Aliens'</em> just narrowly better this, though it's a marginal improvement on (the entertaining) <em>'Alien Resurrection'</em> and it surpasses every other release, in my eyes.",2024-08-16T18:24:55.893Z,945961,4 stars,0.7821980714797974
CinemaSerf,7.0,"I gather director Fede Alvarez made a conscious - and probably expensive - decision to keep the use of CGI to a minimum here and it really does work. ""Rain"" (Cailee Spaeny) and her ""brother"" are looking to get off-planet but she can't get travel papers from the all-powerful mining company. Desperate, she and ""Andy"" (David Jonsson) are offered a chance by wide boys ""Tyler"" (Archie Renaux) and ""Bjorn"" (Spike Fearn) to raid a decrepit old spacecraft that appears to be in a decaying orbit, so they can pinch it's cryogenic pods and enable them all to escape to another planet out of reach of their enthralling taskmasters. Off they set onto the ""Romulus"" and that's where, well you just know what's going to happen now, as they inadvertently turn the central heating on and find themselves in mortal danger. ""Andy"" just happens to be a synthetic, which proves especially useful when they discover the remains of ""Rook"" (the spitting image of the late Sir Ian Holm) but is this oozing mess of gunge and wiring actually an help or an hindrance? Getting off is going to be a lot harder than getting on! To be honest, the acting here is really neither here nor there. Renaux and Isabella Merced - their cohort ""Kay"" do enough, Fearn rather over-plays his chip-on-the-shoulder character and there's a slightly soporific effort from Jonsson, but that's not what I was watching for. This is all about the best monsters sci-fi cinema has ever created, and right from their first appearance I was in their corner. There's loads of darkly shot menace crammed into the two hours with plenty of references to it's originator and even more insinuations about the greed of a ""company"" that doesn't know when to leave well alone. Just like the other ""Alien"" films, it takes a Russian Doll approach to the ending, so don't think we're going to get off with just the one, definitive, ""get away from her..."" moment, and of course the lift plays a pivotal part in the proceedings as acid blood drips everywhere.

MovieGuys,6.0,"Whilst not as awful as the Aliens franchise films that came after the excellent first and second films, starring Sigourney Weaver, Alien Romulus is not without its shortcomings. 

Whats immediately noticeable, in spite of the rugged, industrial setting, is a cast that look like they just escaped from the set of Beverly Hills 90210. Youthful, fresh faced, physically unimposing, with not a grease stain or blemish in sight, they feel badly out of place. 

If you can put the sense of disbelief regarding the casting aside (I couldn't) the actual story fares only marginally better. It feels like a borrowed affair, where its taken aspects of the first two successful films and tried to craft a newer iteration.

The results an alright, if at times, somewhat ridiculous story, punctuated by moments of compelling action. That said, haven't we seen it all before, in one form or another? 

In summary, miscasting combined with a story that blandly apes superior earlier films, leads to an ""okay"" watch that's fails to distinguish itself.If you are new to this franchise, my advice start with Alien from 1979 and then its plural successor Aliens, instead.",2024-08-21T00:53:05.907Z,945961,2 stars,0.46582451462745667

Going back to the roots of the “Alien” franchise, the film tells the story of a group of young space colonizers (Cailee Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced, Aileen Wu, and Spike Fearn)who are looking for a way out of their current situation as hard laborers on a sunless planet. While searching the universe, they encounter a decommissioned ship that has enough supplies to take them far, far away. Intent on scavenging, the group makes a risky voyage into space where they get far more than they bargained for: a face-to-face encounter with a terrifying life form from which they may have no hope of escape.

The strength of the story is also in its simplicity, and Alvarez uses swift pacing and straightforward character development to create an irresistible hook for audiences. He creates a crackerjack blend of suspense, horror, and science fiction that not only hearkens back to the original films, but also offers up something fresh and modernized for a new generation. Even better, the film is very dark and isn’t dumbed down for casual viewers, which shows a great deal of respect to long-time sci-fi fans. This isn’t just another sequel that is exploiting a franchise’s good will, it actually has some substance.

There’s an atmosphere of dread that commands most of the movie, and the action scenes are imaginative and inspired. I was on the edge of my seat multiple times, and several of the set pieces are visually fun, too. The special effects are not flashy or over-polished like the ones that tend to dominate modern blockbusters (even the alien creature itself remains largely unchanged from its original, iconic 1979 design), which turns out to be the perfect complement to the film’s strong narrative foundation. Heightened tension and fear is created through well-crafted suspense rather than constant visual bombardment. There’s a level of sophistication here that elevates it beyond a mere retread of past “Alien” films.

I was especially surprised about how quickly I started to care about the characters, who don’t exactly give off the best first impression (they seem like they will be stereotypical and highly annoying, but that’s not the case). As the story unfolds, so do the layers of depth and complexity, both which make the fate of these friends matter. The film is well cast, and Spaeny’s versatility shines through in a role that requires both emotional range and physical intensity.

The film is willing to take risks, especially when it comes to killing off characters. The unpredictability of who will survive and who has the wits to escape from harrowing situations adds another layer of tension and sense of danger. Nothing here feels preordained, and that in itself is exciting.

“Alien: Romulus” is a wildly satisfying addition to the franchise because it’s a film that understands what made the original great and uses those elements to create something new and exciting. It succeeds in paying homage to its predecessors while also forging its own identity, honoring its legacy in a way that will have sci-fi nerds salivating for future installments.

Manuel São Bento,7.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://movieswetextedabout.com/alien-romulus-review-an-audiovisual-triumph-held-back-by-reverence-to-the-past/

""Alien: Romulus is an impressive technical spectacle that highlights Fede Álvarez's talent in creating an atmosphere of tension and horror, raising the audiovisual standard of the saga to new heights through immersive sound design and Galo Olivares' stunning cinematography, which deserves countless accolades.

However, its excessive reliance on references to the past prevents it from reaching its full narrative potential, as well as achieving a thematic impact similar to the franchise's best installments.

Despite this, the captivating performances of Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson, along with a third act filled with insane entertainment, make this interquel a cinematic experience worth seeing in IMAX, even if it leaves the feeling that it could have been more daring and innovative.""

Mister BLAQK,7.0,"Alien: Romulus is a love letter to the 1979 classic, and while I dug the whole philosophical space-god thing in Prometheus, this stripped-down, back-to-basics approach had me hooked from the first frame.  It's been a while since an Alien film truly captured that sense of claustrophobic dread, and Romulus nails it.

This movie is gorgeous, plain and simple. The lighting, the camera angles, and Benjamin Wallfisch's score – it all blends together to create this constant tension that just sucks you in. There's this one scene where Rain, Andy and Tyler are being chased through the research station, the way they use the shadows and movement, it's like a masterclass in suspense. It totally reminded me of the most terrifying moments from the original. It's obvious Álvarez was obsessed with recreating that gritty, lived-in feel of the first Alien, and it pays off big time.

The cast is solid too. Cailee Spaeny and David Jonsson absolutely kill it as Rain and Andy.  I'll admit, I was worried Andy would be your typical forgettable sidekick, but he actually gets a pretty interesting arc.  Sure, most of the crew are basically there to get picked off by the Xenomorph, but Andy was a standout supporting character. He basically played two roles. It's refreshing that the movie doesn't waste time with a bunch of unnecessary characters.

One thing this movie does really well is finding that sweet spot between horror and action that made the first two films so iconic.  Alien 3 was so bleak, and Resurrection was just bonkers action – this one feels like a proper blend of both.  Fede Álvarez basically throws in all the best Alien tropes: the ragtag crew, the creepy body horror stuff, the tense hide-and-seek scenes, and some kickass action sequences. And you know what? It totally works.

I was impressed at a lot of the creative set pieces and how they built tension. Like how they played with gravity to avoid the acid and trying to sneak past the facehuggers by camoflaging their body temperature. They were really cool and shockingly unique and fresh for a nearly 50 old franchise. And let's talk about that body horror. There's this one scene, a seriously messed-up vaginal birth, that is going to be burned into my brain for a while. Álvarez definitely gets what makes this franchise tick.

I'm giving Alien: Romulus a strong 7/10.  It lost some points for the use of the CGI Ian Holm. It's so distracting, and they rely on it way too much.  Also, there some lines that were stuck in there for nostalgia that felt out of place.  But honestly, those are minor nitpicks in a movie that's this much fun. The whole final act, with the station crashing into the asteroid field and that epic showdown with the Human/ Xeno, is just pure chaos in the best way possible.

Alien: Romulus is a worthy successor to the Alien throne. It's a visual treat, a thrilling ride, and a damn good reminder of why we love this franchise in the first place.",2024-10-16T17:43:30.277Z,945961,4 stars,0.4475616216659546

cineast78,8.0,"**Maybe the best ""Alien"" movie after ""Aliens"", but at least as good as Prometheus (but in a different way)**

I enjoyed this movie a lot. It didn't try to be edgy or special - it seems to be directed by a guy who loved the first 2 Alien movies from the 80ies and wanted to add a movie as best as he could do in our time which is still faithful to those 2 original movies and could be considered a worthy addition to the original ""Alien"" storyline.

The acting was overall very good. Cailee Spaeny as the lead actress gave a solid performance as expected. But the surprise of the movie was David Jonsson as her android ""brother"", who was the highlight of the movie actingwise for me.

Another main thing to mention are the effects and set desing. A lot of great practical effects, lighting and cinematography and the set design which is faithful to that of the first 2 Alien movies make this movie a great enjoyment for anyone who like the.

kevin2019,6.0,"""Alien: Romulus"" is a visually admirable film, but it really has nothing new to show us and even worse than that it has nothing fresh to say. It is merely content to plunder inspiration from the preceding films and the only entry in the series which appears to be left unplundered is ""Alien 3"" (1992), but then this omission can hardly be described as surprising. After all, it isn't held in particularly high regard by the legions of loyal fans who absolutely adore these films for their often groundbreaking achievements and idolise the inexhaustible resourcefulness of Ellen Ripley. Unfortunately, these same loyal fans aren't going to find anything worth adoring or idolising in this latest effort. It is still a reasonably entertaining motion picture, but only because you can spend most of the running time attempting to guess which scene comes from which film in order to appease your overwhelming sense of disappointment with it all.",2024-12-24T01:28:01.589Z,945961,3 stars,0.5590600967407227

This latest one, which takes place in between Alien: Covenant and Alien in the timeline, is a solid entry from Fede Alvarez and is more in the vein of the first film in terms of look and tone. The story is pretty basic and no real twists that we haven't seen before in the franchise, but I did like the lead actress Cailee Spaeny. The classic line, ""Getaway from her you bitch"" was delivered as great as Bale's ""I'll be back"" from Terminator Salvation (meaning not very well). Still, an all around entertaining sci-fi horror film that has great effects, both practical and CGI. **3.5/5**",2024-12-25T08:24:19.389Z,945961,3 stars,0.7580428123474121
RoRo Nereus,4.0,"Fede Álvarez delivers a film in Alien: Romulus that tries to revitalize the franchise but stumbles on several key aspects. While visually appealing and faithful to the oppressive atmosphere characteristic of the saga, the movie lacks a solid narrative and memorable characters.

The script relies too heavily on genre clichés, with bland dialogue and unconvincing decisions from its protagonists. Attempts to explore philosophical themes about survival and human nature remain superficial, leaving the impression that the film tries to tackle more than it can handle.

Álvarez’s direction, which has shone in the past with more intimate horror projects, feels overwhelmed in such an established universe. The moments of tension and terror fail to achieve the desired impact, falling into an uneven rhythm that alternates between dull and predictable.

For the most devoted fans of Alien, this installment is particularly disappointing. In an unfortunate parallel to Disney's mishandling of the Star Wars saga, Romulus feels like a production that prioritizes franchise formulas over true innovation or respect for the original spirit. Rather than expanding the Alien legacy, the film dilutes it, leaving a bitter aftertaste for fans who had expected much more.

Ultimately, Alien: Romulus fails to live up to its heritage, becoming a missed opportunity and a reminder that not all cinematic revivals are necessary.",2024-12-27T19:53:25.932Z,945961,2 stars,0.7829196453094482
RappScallion73,5.0,"Alien: Romulus starts off promising enough, with interesting takes on the dystopian world of the Alien franchise combined with beautiful cinematography and a creepy atmosphere. But around the half-hour mark, it starts going downhill — and accelerates with every passing minute.

The worst part is the incessant and extremely annoying fan service and visual callbacks to the previous movies, combined with a horrible CGI re-creation of Ash from Alien. These moments take you out of the film completely and utterly ruin whatever atmosphere or build-up the director had going. It’s like an ignored child shouting for attention: “Look at me, look at me! Remember this famous line from Aliens? Huh? Do you? What about this one from Alien? Huh? Do you? Aren’t we clever for putting it here in the movie?” It’s frustrating.

Combine that with a plot that’s basically a rehash of Alien and Prometheus, and you have a movie that feels uninspired and predictable. The young cast also gives Alien: Romulus a whole “Camp Crystal in spaaaace” vibe, which doesn’t help.

There are some good moments, though — a few innovative action scenes, and David Jonsson is genuinely great as the android Andy. However, these few flashes of brilliance aren’t enough to save the movie from mediocrity.",2025-10-10T05:17:11.180Z,945961,2 stars,0.6976602077484131

CinemaSerf,6.0,"""Lily"" (Blake Lively) is supposed to give an eulogy at her father's funeral, but she can't. Even with her mother (Amy Morton) there and in the full glare of a packed church, she cannot find five good things to say about the man. Quickly we learn - through some flashbacks - just why that is, and just why she's grown up to be a bit of a romantic. Then she encounters neuro-surgeon ""Ryle"" (Justin Baldoni) and there is instant chemistry. She then opens a long-dreamed of flower shop and a stranger walks in seeking a job. Guess what? She's ""Allysa"" (Jenny Slate) who just happens to be the sister of her enigmatic stranger. Maybe they can make a go of things? Well a dinner one evening brings her face to face with ""Atlas"" (Brandon Sklenar) and that takes us back down the path of retrospection as it turns out that in her younger days, she (Isabela Ferrer) has met this vagrant (Alex Neustaedter) and they's had quite an intense relationship until her father (Kevin McKidd) caught them, and - well you can use your imagination. When ""Ryle"" catches them chatting, he suspects the worst and that proceeds to cause his behaviour to materially change the dynamics as matters take a series of quite unpleasant turns. Now, quite why anyone thought this was a film worth making eluded me. Sure the subject matter is serious, but this plodding drama just takes way too long to get going and then when it might to become more compelling it runs out of steam. The camerawork pays far too much superficial attention to the undercooked character of ""Lily"" and the writing all too often resorts to power-ballad mode when the story becomes potentially more poignant and resonant. We know that the gist of the plot is to underscore not just the effects of domestic violence in the present, but to try and understand the sources so that path need never be taken again, but it's all presented in too shallow a fashion and could easily lose half an hour without impacting on the thrust - such as it is - of the drama.

r96sk,8.0,"I found <em>'It Ends with Us'</em> to be largely great, though the way it ends does make me question how I feel about it.

The performances of Blake Lively, Justin Baldoni <em>(just me who thinks he looks a touch like Runar from <em>'Ice Age'</em>? ...)</em>, Brandon Sklenar, Jenny Slate - heck, even Isabela Ferrer and Alex Neustaedter <em>(iffy likeness aside)</em> - are stellar. I sensed a lot of chemistry between Lively & Baldoni and Lively & Sklenar, which is impressive to succeed in that area twice.

Pace-wise the movie jumps along nicely, all the other major elements like editing, music and whatever are all well done and are only plus points. However, the conclusion disappoints a bit. I do think it just about regains its footing to produce a positive ending, though how it gets there by wrapping up the relationship between Lively's Lily and Baldoni's Atlas left me feeling a bit uneasy. As did a few other scenes, though they were of course as intended.

Amusing that I'm pretty sure I was the only dude (or at least one of a few) in a packed cinema watching this. Upon exiting, visually I kinda felt like Will Smith in that famous <em>'The Pursuit of Happyness'</em> <em>(which I still haven't seen btw, gotta get on that)</em> crowd scene - only surrounded by women.

moviepoptime,-1.0,"It Ends With Us, directed by Justin Baldoni and based on Colleen Hoover's bestselling novel, explores the complexities of love and domestic abuse through the eyes of Lily Bloom (Blake Lively). The film captures Lily's journey from a hopeful flower shop owner to a woman facing the harsh realities of her relationship with Ryle (Justin Baldoni), a charming but abusive neurosurgeon.

My Experience:

Watching It Ends With Us was both impactful and frustrating. The cinematography was beautiful, and Lively delivered a nuanced performance that conveyed Lily's internal struggles effectively. However, I felt the film struggled with pacing and often leaned too heavily on melodrama, which detracted from its emotional weight. The portrayal of domestic violence was raw and unsettling, but at times it felt like it glossed over the deeper implications of such trauma.

While I appreciated the film’s attempt to address serious themes, the resolution felt overly neat and left me questioning its message about healing and forgiveness. Overall, It Ends With Us left me with mixed feelings; it was visually engaging and thought-provoking but ultimately fell short of delivering a satisfying emotional payoff.

I have heard of the video game that <em>'Borderlands'</em> is based upon, though my knowledge of it doesn't extend past that one and only fact. I knew nothing else about it, so I can't comment on this in regards how well it adapts the game. As a movie though, I did get the required enjoyment from it.

Sure the story could've been greater, but what's produced kept me watching all the way through - it's a watchable flick. I did like the cast and characters, all of whom I found suitably interesting. Cate Blanchett is good fun in the lead role, Kevin Hart is perhaps a tad underused but satisfactory nonetheless, while Ariana Greenblatt impresses.

Jack Black is the one I enjoyed most, admittedly that's no surprise given I am a fan of that guy as an actor. I will say that his character is the opposite of Hart's Roland, in that I think the filmmakers should've utilised him less - he does get a bit too much screen time for a side character. However, as it's Black voicing Claptrap I can't possibly say I didn't like seeing him.

Yep - it proceeds exactly as you'd expect, except for the frankly bamboozling contribution of Jamie Lee Curtis (and her red glasses) who does look like she's enjoying herself on set but, like Blanchett, is just a complete fish out of water as the banal dialogue and set-piece combat scenes pass the entire project into the hands of the CGI developers.

TheSceneSnobs,1.0,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. To preface, I want to clarify that I know nothing about the Borderlands video games—I’ve never played them, and I have no bias against them. However, I approached this movie with some trepidation, knowing Eli Roth's track record with handling other IPs has been less than stellar.

From the outset, Borderlands feels like a blatant attempt to rip off Guardians of the Galaxy. The influence is undeniable, but Roth clearly missed what made Guardians so special. Borderlands is one dance-off scene short of being a direct copy, but even if Roth had included a dance-off, he probably would have cast an Australian Olympic breakdancer—an ill-fitting choice emblematic of how off-target this film is.

The movie throws the audience into a barrage of nonsensical twists and turns that lack coherence or purpose. The narrative seems to be constantly shifting, yet never in a way that feels organic or meaningful. The lack of a coherent plot makes it difficult to stay invested, and the film quickly becomes tedious.

Another glaring issue is the film's failure to create any meaningful connection between its main characters. In Guardians of the Galaxy, the chemistry among the team is a driving force, making their adventures feel both exciting and emotionally resonant. In contrast, Borderlands completely misses this mark. The characters are paper-thin, with little to no development, and their interactions lack the spark needed to make the audience care about their journey.

Visually, the film also disappoints. The aesthetic choices, from the set design to the visual effects, fail to create a compelling or immersive world. The film’s attempt to capture the wild, chaotic energy of the Borderlands universe falls flat, resulting in a bland and uninspired visual experience. 

Overall, Borderlands is a truly boring movie, devoid of character development, narrative coherence, or visual appeal. It’s a film that not only fails to honor the spirit of its source material but also fails to stand on its own as an entertaining piece of cinema. Eli Roth’s attempt to capture the magic of Guardians of the Galaxy is misguided and ultimately unsuccessful, resulting in a forgettable and frustrating experience. This movie serves as a reminder that simply mimicking successful formulas without understanding what makes them work is a recipe for disaster.",2024-08-26T21:08:36.856Z,365177,1 star,0.6545773148536682

For my money too, much of the cast just don't fit this kind of over the top action genre. As a result a good number of performances feel more than a little awkward.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,2.0,"Writer / director M. Night Shyamalan‘s most annoying filmmaking traits are on full display in his latest movie “Trap,” a psychological thriller that initially promises an engaging narrative but ultimately collapses into the void of ridiculous twists and turns. This is far from Shyamalan’s finest hour, and the film rambles and sputters into one of his most unbelievable and absurd revelations yet, one that is so inanely dumb that it’s impossible to suspend disbelief.

The story follows everyday dad Cooper (Josh Hartnett) attending an afternoon concert with his teenage daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue). Lady Raven (Saleka Shyamalan) is the hottest ticket in town, and Cooper splurged on floor tickets to make his little girl happy. Things seem fine until they’re not, and it’s revealed that Cooper is actually a serial killer nicknamed Butcher. Turns out the cops have set up a complex police blockade at the show with the intent on capturing him, and it’s clear he has no way out. Forced to use his wits to evade and escape, Cooper comes up with a series of clever distractions in order to keep his deep, dark secret hidden away from the FBI agent and criminal profiler in charge (Hayley Mills).

The first half of the movie is compelling enough, with a tense atmosphere and a buildup that hints at a plot that could have some sophisticated intricacies. It’s fun to watch how Cooper’s mind works, and it’s uncomfortable once you realize you’re rooting for a serial murderer to escape. This is done reasonably well and is the best part of the movie. The second half, however, derails spectacularly. The story becomes increasingly convoluted and nonsensical, introducing a series of ludicrous twists that undermine any semblance of coherence. This is bad even for Shyamalan.

Hartnett does a great job with his performance and is tasked with playing two men in one. He’s believable as the calm and goofy dad, but also switches to a dark psychopath on a dime. He’s by far the best part of the movie. Of course, while Harnett’s performance is one of the most enjoyable aspects, one of the film’s most glaring flaws is the weak turn from Saleka Shyamalan. I don’t want to pick on her as she is the director’s own daughter, but the forced nepotism reeks here. Saleka can’t act, she’s a mediocre singer and songwriter (a half dozen of her original songs are prominently featured during a majority of the film’s run time), and the movie comes across as being made solely to showcase M. Night’s kid while trying to make her a star. Her performance is as unconvincing as Harnett’s is credible.

With a contrived and nonsensical plot, bad performances, and an illogical twist that will leave you more frustrated than entertained, “Trap” is another disappointing effort from a director who could do so much better.

r96sk,6.0,"Quite the nosedive!

I actually enjoyed the opening chunk of <em>'Trap'</em>, everything at the music concert is fairly well done and kept the intrigue alive for me. However, once events leave the arena the movie absolutely bombs its way to the finish. The last portion of the film is terrible viewing, it felt like it just kept going and going and going.

There are plot holes aplenty, nonsensical 'twists' and character decisions/abilities. Cooper, played finely to be fair by Josh Hartnett, is absolutely some sort of big shot in his 'line of work', though makes some dumb mistakes. Though he is apparently capable of teleportation, based on one scene involving a limo.

I'm not someone who needs every inch of a movie to make sense, I can enjoy something that's simply an entertaining watch; even with poorly crafted elements elsewhere in the movie. This, unfortunately, ends up being just bad. That is a shame, because I honestly did like (albeit mildly) the stuff at the venue.

Very surprised to see the fairly good reception this has received so far on a few sites, I would not have predicted that but, hey, what do I know?",2024-08-09T17:30:35.817Z,1032823,2 stars,0.6219091415405273
CinemaSerf,6.0,"Well the best bits of this are most definitely in the trailers! ""Cooper"" (Josh Hartnett) takes his daughter ""Riley"" (Ariel Donoghue) to see a ""Lady Raven"" (Saleka Shyamalan) concert only to find that when they are in the arena, the feds descend on the place like a ton of bricks and thanks to some secret information obtained from the guy who sells the T-shirts, we discover that it's all an elaborate trap to ensnare the ""Butcher"". As the name suggests, he's a brutal serial-chopper whom they know is at the concert. With the net tightening, we begin realise quickly who the identity of the murderer is and so now have to sit through an increasingly preposterous hundred minutes of cat and mouse with Hayley Mills hoping to catch her man. At times this does generate a bit of menace as he sees the openings to flee being systematically closed in front of him, and with his enthusiastic daughter in tow, his options are increasingly limited but in the end it's all peters out into a rather ridiculous ending that I found rather weak, implausible and disappointingly unoriginal. Hartnett just hasn't the manner to convince as the baddie and there's way too much concert-style material that suggests Miss Shyamalan asked her dad if she could have a film for Christmas. Too long and too feeble, sorry.",2024-08-13T08:06:31.285Z,1032823,3 stars,0.36869585514068604

TheSceneSnobs,7.0,"I was hooked by the premise of Trap from the moment I saw the trailer. The idea of a serial killer bringing his daughter to a Taylor Swift-like concert, only for it to be a police trap to capture him, immediately grabbed my attention. I’ve always enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan’s films, particularly when he reveals the twist right from the beginning. With Josh Hartnett in the role of the serial killer, I was eager to see how this intriguing setup would unfold.

The premise of Trap is undeniably captivating, setting up a high-stakes thriller from the outset. The concept of a seemingly innocent concert turning into the backdrop for a police sting operation is both original and suspenseful. 

Josh Hartnett delivers a terrific performance, portraying the serial killer with a chilling mix of charisma and cold calculation. His ability to switch between a doting father and a remorseless killer is unsettling and adds layers to his character. For instance, a scene where he interacts lovingly with his daughter moments before revealing his sinister intentions showcases Hartnett’s range and adds to the film’s tension. His portrayal keeps the audience on edge, wondering how far his character will go and how the situation will unravel.

Trap is a movie that requires some suspension of disbelief, as it occasionally stretches the bounds of plausibility. However, if you allow yourself to get lost in the story, the film is an intense thriller from beginning to end. The pacing is well-handled, with the tension building steadily as the plot unfolds.

That said, the film does have its share of plot holes and moments that strain credibility. There are a few instances where the suspension of disbelief is pushed to its limits, such as the police’s elaborate setup and the killer’s seemingly superhuman ability to evade capture. These elements can be distracting, particularly in the final act, where the film becomes somewhat redundant. The climax, while thrilling, feels repetitive and doesn’t fully capitalize on the strong buildup that precedes it.

Despite these issues, I walked away from Trap having enjoyed it enough to consider watching it again. The film is a fun, intense thriller that keeps you engaged throughout, provided you’re willing to overlook some of its more implausible moments. Josh Hartnett’s performance is a standout, and the film’s unique premise is executed well enough to deliver a satisfying, if not entirely flawless, viewing experience. If you’re a fan of Shyamalan’s work or enjoy thrillers that blend suspense with psychological drama, Trap is worth your time.",2024-08-26T18:42:52.748Z,1032823,4 stars,0.6685223579406738
WideEyes,1.0,"What a ridiculous movie. Cooper spends the entire time behaving in the most bizarre and suspicious way possible, the FBI and every other law enforcement agency have handed operational control (including storming in and tazing a suspect) to a profiler, and he's allowed to escape multiple times by the most breathtaking incompetence on the part of LEOs. Nothing about this movie is believable, the acting is completely OTT, and the plot is barely extant. Do yourself a favour, just buy the soda and popcorn and skip the movie.",2024-08-31T23:08:26.230Z,1032823,1 star,0.908900797367096
tmdb51616167,7.0,"M. Night Shyamalan is a director that I've struggled to appreciate. Despite giving his movies multiple chances, I've found most of them to be lacking in some way. Even films like ""Old"" started strong but fell flat with their endings.

I continue to try to grasp Shyamalan's vision and goals in the cinematic realm, but his tendency towards over-the-top and confusing plots often makes it challenging to enjoy his work. Nevertheless, I decided to give his latest movie, ""Trap,"" a chance and headed to the theater.

In this film, Josh Hartnett delivers a stellar performance that keeps you engaged from start to finish. Overall, I found the movie to be well-executed. However, the biggest flaw lies in Shyamalan's struggle to land a solid ending. Instead of choosing one direction, he incorporates multiple ideas, resulting in a convoluted and confusing conclusion that leaves viewers puzzled about the plot's resolution and twists.

""Trap"" follows this trend, offering multiple endings that make you think the movie could have wrapped up several times over. Despite the extra 20 or 30 minutes of extended runtime, the film manages to remain decent. While it may feel lengthy at times, the overall quality holds up.",2024-09-01T21:01:02.870Z,1032823,3 stars,0.5868496298789978
MovieGuys,4.0,"Over the years I'd say my personal opinion of M. Night Shyamalan‘s work, is somewhat mixed. 

Trap however, leaves no room for compromise. In my opinion, its simply poor. Why? Its scripting and associated characterisations, lack depth and intelligence. 

Okay, the idea of a setting an elaborate trap for a serial killer, in a concert, is interesting.Yet, in spite of the fact the main character is apparently a highly successful, if that's the right word, cold and calculating killer, who has, thus far, evaded capture, then why does he behave like a clumsy amateur? 

The ensuing litany of naff moves by our anti hero, combined with ham fisted plot twists and turns, leads to a tale that doesn't ring true or make a lot of rational sense. Suffice to say Trap is a disappointing watch, that quickly squanders any currency, it might have had. 

Its a shame too, as there are definite upsides. Production values are above average, there are no issues with the quality of acting and a credible performance, as the concerts lead singer, is handed in Shyamalan‘s daughter. Its not my kind of music but its clear, she's genuinely talented. 

In summary, strong production values, acting and performances, don't make up for a clumsy, less than subtle script, that left this reviewer  feeling underwhelmed, by this ultimately dull, psychological thriller.",2024-09-05T00:13:09.263Z,1032823,2 stars,0.7042737007141113

I'm disappointed because I thought this was a horror movie. The tagline is misleading. It should read ""A father takes his daughter to a concert, only to realize they're at the center of a dark and sinister event."" because his daughter didn't realize anything.

I'm also disappointed because I really thought Alison Pill was his secret accomplice. This is a bit of me typecasting her after her psycho role as Betty in Them (2021). I need more Alison Pill in my life.",2024-09-05T00:28:32.675Z,1032823,2 stars,0.5352099537849426

ragmondo,3.0,"Truly Dreadful. I didn't realise that the main theme of this film was explicit nepotism until I saw that Shamyamalan cast his own daughter as the female lead / singer / star in a somewhat vain attempt to launch or boost her career. But apart from that, this film just does not make sense. At all. Ever. The dude who spills the beans (no spoiler as it's in the trailer) .. I mean .. how on earth does someone have to be that unaware ?? Also, just the actions and words of each character don't ever add up to what they would do or say in a similar (lol) situation. Doesn't anyone ever push back in the writer's room and say ""listen, the character x has just discovered ... and the first thing we've written they do is ...???!"".

Let's just take a tiny moment in the concert. At one point, a guest singer comes up in the middle of the floor on a lift RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR CROWD ! And they leave the hole just .. literally ... gaping for anyone to fall into etc.  Did any of the writers actually ever go to a concert before or are they always in the back VIP section ?

r96sk,9.0,"Its story may not be the strongest, but the comedy makes <em>'Deadpool & Wolverine'</em> an excellent watch!

There are some top notch gags in there, particularly to do with the recent offscreen changes for Wade Wilson's alter ego. As you'd expect with Ryan Reynolds in this role, the jokes are plentiful and there is barely any time to react to one before another appears. That can sometimes not work as well as intended, e.g. <em>'Deadpool 2'</em>, but here the humour is executed perfectly.

Reynolds himself is quality, it is a quintessential Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool performance. It's real neat to see Hugh Jackman back as Wolverine, he does play second fiddle to the other titular character but still more than holds his own, as you'd expect. Emma Corrin, meanwhile, enters the MCU with a great showing.

As noted at the top, I do think the plot couldn't been superior - but not in a negative way. What is portrayed is still entertaining to watch, it's just not necessarily on the same level as the comedic elements. A fun watch, all the same. Do I like it more than the 2016 original?

Brent Marchant,6.0,"In moviemaking, sadly, there can be a problem with going to the well too many times, and this latest installment in one of filmdom’s better cinematic franchises verges on proving just that. This offering’s predecessors (2016, 2018) significantly distinguished themselves from the kind of fare typically found in the superhero genre with their outrageously bawdy humor, hilarious sight gags and relentlessly maverick attitude. This time out, however, director Shawn Levy’s latest effort is a decidedly hit or miss affair, with an often-incoherent script that feels like it was cobbled together from a collection of leftover parts, some of which work and some of which don’t. I suppose that’s not entirely surprising from a screenplay that was penned by four different writers, making me wonder how much consensus was in place in compiling the finished product. Moreover, this film appears to be intended to fold the Deadpool franchise into the X-Men franchise, an intriguing idea that, regrettably, is handled rather clumsily (as has often been the case with many other recent fusion offerings in the Marvel Universe). And, if all that weren’t bad enough, this release gives short shrift to the colorful cast of supporting players that made the Deadpool films so funny, original and enjoyable, relegating them to little more than cameos in favor of walk-ons by a host of other MCU characters (some of them remarkably obscure, I might add) in an attempt to help cement the franchise cross-pollination going on here. It makes for awkward storytelling at times, especially for viewers who might not be familiar with these lesser-known figures, some of which are drawn from Marvel source material unrelated to its big screen offerings. To the picture’s credit, it features yet another stellar turn by Ryan Reynolds as the off-color protagonist, as well as its share of hilarious bits (without a doubt the franchise’s historically strongest suit), including a number of unabashed, razor-sharp asides referencing off-screen developments related to the studios that produced these films and the actors who have appeared in them. These strengths notwithstanding, however, this is a production that has sadly watered down the elements that best made this franchise work in favor of an overarching programming agenda that simply doesn’t serve this film or the series particularly well. The creators would have served themselves and viewers better by sticking with what works and the basics of good storytelling than trying to force an issue for the sake of future productions that may or may not work over the long term. This has been a noticeable downfall in the quality of many of the most recent Marvel Universe releases, and I’d truly hate to see this franchise befall a similar fate.",2024-07-27T23:10:02.772Z,533535,3 stars,0.4109463691711426

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Well the ""Deadpool"" concept is now well and truly immersed in the Marvel multi-verse and I really did fear for good old ""Dead"". More of the same? Well, no actually. Ryan Reynolds has reverted more to the occasionally quite vulgar humour of the first film (2016) and allowed this trequel to focus more on the personality of this irreverent, immortal, superhero as he tries to resurrect the recently departed ""Wolverine/Logan"" (Hugh Jackman) so he can save his timeline from erasure. To do that, and thwart the comically menacing ""Paradox"" (Matthew Macfadyen), he has to face down ""Cassandra Nova"" (Emma Corrin) - who happens to be the long estranged twin sister of ""Xavier"" who presides over the void. That's a ""Mad Max"" style desert style territory where all the undesirables have been put by ""Paradox"" and his organisation over the years. Initially, there's no love lost between our two heroes. The cocky man in red lycra does not impress his new, booze-soaked and guilt-ridden buddy, but quickly they manage to align their priorities and then - well yes, you can guess the rest. Indeed, there's nothing remotely unpredictable about any of this, but what it does do is shout loudly and proudly that it knows it. It's not trying to reinvent the wheel, it's succeeding in pointing out that all of these multi-verse films that simply adjust the space/time continuum to provide a new setting for the same old stories ad characters has to stop before we (the audience) bore further of their repetitive combat cycles and nondescript plot lines. Maybe Reynolds does over-egg the smuttiness a little but there are still plenty of wry comments about the industry, product placement and the plethora of films (and actors) that have preceded it delivering same old same old. It's not forgotten to entertain us too - there are loads of action scenes and there's an amiable chemistry between two actors who are clearly on the same, suitably sarcastic, page throughout a two hours that also features a some fun cameos from the likes of Messrs. Evans, Snipes, Cavill, Favreau and Tatum to keep it moving along with an effervescence of spirit. It's a big screen essential, there's a lot of effort gone into the production that won't work so well on the telly, and I enjoyed it.",2024-07-29T06:24:25.060Z,533535,4 stars,0.4596956968307495
TheSceneSnobs,8.0,"Deadpool and Wolverine is a movie that I truly believe the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has needed for a while. After years of lackluster installments, this film is a breath of fresh air. Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, and director Shawn Levy approached this project with care and a deep understanding of what fans want. The film feels like it was crafted by fans for fans, particularly those who have been frustrated by the recent phases of the MCU.

Reynolds and Levy brought on a team of writers with a strong background in comedy and storytelling. This decision pays off, as the film’s humor and narrative are both sharp and engaging. For example, the meta vibe of Deadpool, familiar from the previous two films, is ramped up significantly. The movie spares no one, making jokes about everything from Hugh Jackman’s recent divorce to Ryan Reynolds' career. However, it’s the MCU that receives the most pointed and critical jokes, which will resonate with long-time fans.

The chemistry between Reynolds and Jackman is electric, bringing new life to both characters. Their dynamic is both hilarious and heartfelt, making for a compelling narrative. For instance, scenes where Deadpool and Wolverine banter while taking down enemies are filled with wit and energy, showcasing their unique bond. This camaraderie extends to the film’s supporting cast, with well-timed cameos and clever nods to previous Marvel movies.

The film's self-awareness and willingness to poke fun at its own franchise are refreshing. This level of meta-commentary sets the film apart from typical superhero fare.

Despite its comedic approach, the film doesn’t skimp on emotional depth. The storyline is carried by genuine heart, particularly in how it addresses themes of redemption and friendship. The climax is especially impactful, ranking among the greats in the franchise.

This isn't just a good sequel; it's a game-changer for the MCU. The film successfully integrates Deadpool into the broader Marvel Cinematic Universe while maintaining his unique tone and style. It sets the stage for future installments, promising exciting developments ahead. The way the film navigates these transitions feels seamless, ensuring that Deadpool’s irreverent humor doesn’t clash with the MCU’s established tone.

Overall, Deadpool and Wolverine is a standout entry in the MCU, offering a perfect blend of humor, action, and heart. Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman deliver top-notch performances, supported by a smart script and deft direction from Shawn Levy. This film not only redeems past missteps in the franchise but also paves the way for a promising future. It’s a must-watch for any Marvel fan, filled with laughter, thrills, and touching moments that elevate it above many of its predecessors.",2024-07-30T16:14:59.429Z,533535,4 stars,0.5977672338485718
GenerationofSwine,10.0,"It feels a bit rushed... but then it was rushed.  It feels a bit neutered, but it's now Disney and they did muzzle it.

The thing is though... it's not woke, which is why you have articles criticizing it for ""Not Being Gay Enough"" and in 2024, that very literally translates to: ""They focused on a story and characters rather than a political agenda and we're mad about it."" Which, in turn, translates to ""Actually entertaining.""

It's amazing how articles complaining about a movie not being Gay enough can guarantee you that the movie is going to be good.

And if they make another movie that wants to entertain and not push an agenda, I will gladly give them MORE of my money... because at the end of the day, entertainment has been in a decade long drought brought to you by political lecturing and nerd domains have been intentionally attacking fans rather than making movies, like this, that make fans want to give them their money.

In this third entry, you will find a lot of cameos which are absolutely pointless, except for people to chug memberberries, as they do absolutely nothing with these characters. It doesn't even properly show the backstory of Wolverine.

Marvel is back in its element with this movie, as it takes a playful jab at itself. Deadpool boldly declares that the Multiverse is a mess and proposes putting an end to it - a refreshing take on the superhero genre.

The dance sequence is a hilarious throwback to the 90s, adding a touch of nostalgia and charm to the film. And yes, there is plenty of colorful language, including an abundance of the infamous F word - but then again, what else would you expect from Deadpool?

Prepare to be amazed by some incredible cameos that will leave you jumping out of your seat with excitement, especially if you have a soft spot for certain characters from the past. This movie is an absolute thrill ride that pays homage to the Fox universe and its beloved characters.

Without giving too much away, there is a surprising appearance by a fan-favorite character who never made it to the superhero league, and the moment is truly jaw-dropping. The storyline may seem chaotic, but that's all part of the Deadpool charm.

While the villain could have been utilized more effectively given their power, the relationship between Deadpool and Wolverine is beautifully portrayed. The film does a commendable job of explaining the backstory and the humor is on point, with Deadpool's witty jabs and references adding to the entertainment.

If you're a fan of Deadpool and his legacy, this movie is a must-watch that will blow your mind. Just be warned, there is a fair amount of profanity, so consider this if you're planning to bring along younger viewers. 

Overall, this movie was a blast and one of the most enjoyable Marvel experiences in recent memory. From the creative storytelling to the hilarious antics, it's a wild ride that you won't want to miss.

watchnrant,8.0,"**Deadpool & Wolverine: A Comic Book Dream Realized**

From the very beginning, _Deadpool & Wolverine_ bursts onto the screen with the chaotic energy and irreverent humor fans have come to expect from the Merc with a Mouth. This film feels like a love letter to comic book enthusiasts, seamlessly blending the zany, fourth-wall-breaking antics of Deadpool with the gritty, emotionally charged presence of Wolverine. The movie captures the essence of reading a comic book, where big, crazy choices and wild action sequences keep you at the edge of your seat. The introduction of variants and a plethora of cameos from beloved characters across the Marvel Universe only enhances this feeling, making it a true spectacle for long-time fans.

Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine is nothing short of iconic, and this film allows him to fully embrace the character in ways we’ve longed to see. The sight of Wolverine finally donning his classic costume and charging on all fours is a visual treat that elicited cheers from the audience. Jackman’s performance is a testament to his deep connection with the character, proving once again why he's considered one of the best actors of our time.

Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool is as quippy and meta as ever, and the film strikes a delicate balance between humor and heart. The emotional depth is surprising, particularly in scenes where _Deadpool and Wolverine_ share poignant moments. One standout is Deadpool's farewell to Wolverine, which is both a nod to the characters' shared history and a poignant reminder of their enduring bond.

The film's action sequences are top-tier, with choreography that respects each character's unique fighting style. The inclusion of characters like Elektra, Blade, and even a hilarious cameo from Gambit adds layers of excitement and nostalgia. Wesley Snipes' return as Blade, complete with his signature line, ""Some motherfuckers always trying to ice-skate uphill,"" received one of the loudest reactions from the audience.

The story navigates the complexities of timelines and multiverse mechanics with a wink and a nod, never bogging down in overly technical explanations. This approach keeps the focus on the characters and their journeys, making for a more engaging and enjoyable experience.

_Deadpool & Wolverine_ isn't just a comic book movie; it's a celebration of the Marvel Universe's rich history and a heartfelt send-off to characters we've grown to love over the years. Whether you're a die-hard fan or a casual viewer, this film is an emotional whirlwind that invokes nostalgia and opens your heart to the possibilities you imagined as a kid. It's a fitting tribute to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and a testament to the enduring appeal of Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool. This movie is sure to be remembered as one of the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a true comic book dream realized on the big screen.",2024-12-26T10:03:01.928Z,533535,4 stars,0.6073178648948669

CinemaSerf,7.0,"There's a fair amount of screen time given to Bill Clinton in this thriller. Luckily, there are no cigars to be seen as his Presidential visage looks down on FBI agent ""Carter"" (Blair Underwood). He's in charge of an investigation looking into the slaughter of entire families in their homes. There's no evidence of any third party anywhere, with the father invariably found having killed himself after slaughtering just about everyone else. Thing is, fellow agent ""Harker"" (Maika Monroe) thinks that there's way more to it than that. She's got a sort of sixth sense when it comes to these things and soon she and ""Carter"" are on the trail of the eponymous character (the sparingly used but effective Nicolas Cage) who may - or may not - be the source of some cryptic messages left near the site of each atrocity. Central to her theories are some eerily looking dolls. There are child size, perfectly made with porcelain and contain mysterious aluminium spheres. What's the purpose of them? It turns out that ""Harker"" might be able to elicit some answers from her mother ""Ruth"" (Alicia Witt). She's not quite the full shilling but as the detective recalls an encounter with a stranger many years earlier, we begin to wonder if mum might be more involved... It's quirky this story with elements that make sense and others that dart about making it almost impossible to figure out who's doing what to whom nor, more importantly, why? The rather brutal denouement does let it down. It's rushed and serves to fill in years worth of intrigue with five minutes of dialogue - indeed, I couldn't help but wonder if a sequel was in the offing as the story wrapped all too abruptly. Monroe delivers well here, as does photographer Andres Arochi who helps create an almost claustrophobic atmosphere to add quite a bit of tension to the plot. It's not especially scary, but it takes a different approach to creating horror for the mind rather thanks the eyes - and it works quite well.",2024-07-23T11:45:44.092Z,1226578,3 stars,0.5064630508422852

tmdb51616167,5.0,"I recently ventured to the cinema and caught a screening of the latest psychological thriller, ""Longlegs."" The film delves into the twisted world of a serial killer who is believed to be possessed by Satan, using his demonic abilities to target young girls born on the 14th of the month. He gifts these girls a doll, which remains lifeless and silent, serving as a sinister prelude to their impending doom.

Nicolas Cage portrays the enigmatic killer, appearing sporadically throughout the movie in an unsettling all-white ensemble with pale face paint and hair. His eerie rendition of ""Happy Birthday"" and unsettling gestures add to the film's chilling atmosphere, leaving viewers on edge about his potential accomplice.

""Longlegs"" exudes a retro vibe reminiscent of 1980s cinema, with a jarring visual style that may not resonate with contemporary audiences. The disjointed cinematography and truncated framing add to the film's unsettling nature, creating a sense of unease among viewers.

The lead actress delivers a performance that feels uncomfortably raw, as if she herself is grappling with the character's turmoil. Her portrayal adds to the overall discomfort of the film, leaving audiences questioning the extent of her character's possession.

While the film does offer resolution on the identity of ""Longlegs,"" it ultimately falls short of recommendation. As a cinephile who appreciates the nuances of filmmaking, I found ""Longlegs"" lacking in substance and entertainment value. While individual tastes may vary, I prefer films that engage and captivate from start to finish, rather than leaving me feeling disenchanted or disturbed.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"""Cole Davis"" (Channing Tatum) is the launch director at Cape Canaveral and is charged with getting the Apollo 11 mission to the moon (and back!). Thing is, with the Vietnam war in full swing the public have rather lost interest in the space race with the USSR. Presidential adviser ""Moe"" (Woody Harrelson) hits on the idea of bringing in marketing specialist ""Kelly"" (Scarlett Johansson) to spruce things up and get the public - and the US Senate - more engaged with the project before it runs out of money and impetus. She's pushy and brassy and ""Cole"" hates her! Thing is, though, he also starts to realise that she's not half bad at the hoodwinking game and seems to be making some headway engaging sponsors and senators alike with the aspirations of Messrs. Armstrong and Aldrin to set foot in the Sea of Tranquility. With public interest piqued, ""Moe"" realises that the last thing they need is a flop, so he tells ""Kelly"" to create a moonscape and get in her favourite director - ""Lance Vespertine"" (Jim Rash doing his best Stanley Tucci) to essentially make their own, terrestrial, version of the landings that can be shown to the public should the worst case scenario actually occur. With her and ""Cole"" becoming closer and the launch date now imminent, it's soon clear that this isn't just a contingency plan - and that might finally present the unflappable ""Kelly"" with a moral dilemma she can't easily shrug off. What to do? It's quite entertaining, this, with Johansson clearly enjoying herself playing a myriad of parts within her character and there's a decent spark with the better than usual Tatum as the story swipes at politics (largely thanks to a playfully devious effort from Harrelson) and advertising whilst we learn that she is not quite the woman she seems to be. At times the writing is quite funny and the whole thing offers lunar conspiracy theorists (and the disbelieving Soviets) the perfect opportunity for the mother of wet dreams.

A sure sign of that being the case is that I don't have any positives for this movie. Well, OK, Scarlett Johansson is good, but there honestly isn't any other element to this that I can say I enjoyed. Johansson's co-star Channing Tatum feels miscast, I like the guy as an actor but here I didn't feel like he fit - visually his character didn't look or sound like someone out of the 1960s, in my eyes at least.

None of the support cast did anything for me either, though Woody Harrelson and Ray Romano are passable. Away from the cast, the story also didn't hold much interest for me. I feel like the moon landing bits, generally speaking, is all pretty standard and stuff we've seen before. The romance plot isn't merged in well, I didn't sense any chemistry between Johansson and Tatum. The music is also quite weak, almost TV-esque.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,5.0,"“Fly Me to the Moon” is so generic and sanitized that it feels like a blanket, sterilized television sitcom designed to appeal to the masses in middle America. Director Greg Berlanti‘s throwback romance has its moments, but even the chemistry between the leads a few flashes of creativity can’t save the overlong, draggy film.

Set against the backdrop of NASA’s historic Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, former con artist Kelly (Scarlett Johansson) is hired by President Nixon’s clandestine staff member Moe (Woody Harrelson) to launch a marketing campaign on a mission that the White House has deemed too important to fail. Kelly has a huge job cut out for her, and her fiery personality, unconventional methods, and out-of-the-box ideas to fix the space agency’s public image wreaks havoc on the straight-laced launch director, Cole Davis (Channing Tatum). She’s in his way and is a major annoyance, but even Cole can’t deny the sparks that are flying whenever the two are in the same room.

The film works as a mid-level romantic comedy with Johansson and Tatum sharing an agreeable chemistry that, while not exactly electric, at least feels organic. Their playful banter and genuine affection shines, providing some of the film’s most enjoyable moments. It’s a classic odd couple pairing that adds much-needed comedic elements.

The script is messy and forgettable, with a lot of ineffective bids at humor. The most charming aspects are burdened by unnecessary subplots that detract from the main story, making the entire film feel far too long. Certain scenes drag on and on, especially when relying on clichés, predictable plot points, and tired tropes that fail to fully capitalize on the unique setting and wealth of historical context. So much more could’ve been done with this material in a much better way.

Although it provides some decent lighthearted entertainment, “Fly Me to the Moon” plays it so safe that it definitely falls short of its potential. It’s overstuffed and bland to a fault, struggling so mightily to be a crowd pleaser that it squanders most of the charm and authenticity that could have made it something truly special.

""Twisters is exactly what one expects from a disaster flick: a visual spectacle full of action and adrenaline, with a predictable yet effective narrative.

Daisy Edgar-Jones and Glen Powell stand out as protagonists, bringing charisma and chemistry to characters with some emotional depth. Dan Mindel's cinematography and Benjamin Wallfisch's score add to the immersion layer of the summer blockbuster.

It doesn't bring anything new to the genre, nor does it need to, as it fulfills its sole, valid purpose of entertaining its target audience while still respecting the victims of natural disasters, reminding us of the importance of humanity and altruism in times of crisis.""

I'd say the action is an (albeit minor, relatively-speaking) improvement on the original, though I do think the characters and cast aren't quite as strong this time out. Overall, comparing the two, they probably level out to be honest, which is actually a good thing when you're talking about a sequel.

Despite the aforementioned about those onscreen, I did still like the performances of Daisy Edgar-Jones and Glen Powell - the latter is the best performer, in my opinion. With that said, hopefully Powell can get himself out of this typecast of 'overly cocky guy turns out to be sound' as it's getting a bit tiresome, even though I do really rate him as an actor.",2024-07-18T22:57:33.842Z,718821,3 stars,0.5468178391456604
Brent Marchant,6.0,"In the interest of full disclosure, I must confess that this long-delayed sequel to its 1996 blockbuster predecessor is not nearly as awful or hokey as I thought it would be. As a prototypical summertime popcorn movie, director Lee Isaac Chung’s latest hits every item on the checklist of requirements for what such a release should do, and, in that sense, it’s admittedly rather fun – to a point. With that said, however, there’s only so much belief that one can realistically suspend while watching this often-preposterous tale, one that frequently pushes the limits of silliness and credibility. As expected, the tornadoes are the real stars of this picture (and, arguably, justifiably so), while the film’s clichéd, largely monodimensional characters and often-clunky, highly implausible narrative take a dutiful back seat to what clearly (and deservedly) lies front and center. That’s not to say these other elements are completely overshadowed, but their inherently predictable qualities and general lack of imagination fail to set this film apart as something genuinely different, particularly from its precursor. That dearth of innovation is especially apparent, for example, where good ole boy storm chaser Tyler Owens (Glen Powell) is concerned, whose testosterone-soaked persona makes him look more like a reckless, simple-minded yokel than a character to be legitimately taken seriously as someone who might actually know something about cutting-edge meteorology. At the same time, though, by employing these qualities where Powell’s character is concerned, I’d contend that maybe the film should have played them up more, transforming this offering into more of a campy romp, an approach that might have helped to distinguish the picture more than haplessly trying to make it into something to be taken so seriously. In any event, “Twisters” may not be the disaster that it could have been, but, as disaster movies go, it could have been better with a little less predictability, a lot less cliché and considerably more originality.",2024-07-21T21:54:48.997Z,718821,2 stars,0.527521550655365
CinemaSerf,6.0,"A tragedy forces meteorologist ""Kate"" (Daisy Edgar-Jones) back into the office where she spends her days monitoring weather events and advising on whether or not twisters may emerge and issuing any necessary alerts. Another of her erstwhile coleagues, ""Javi"" (Anthony Ramos) shows up with some military-grade technology that can be used to 3-D plot the phenomenon and that gets her back out into the field. That's where she encounters ""Tyler"" (Glen Powell) - he's a ""tornado wrangler"" who uses his guts to drive as close as he can to get great images for his lucrative You Tube channel. Her designs are more altruistic, though. She wants to map the things so she can develop a plan to seed them with super-absorbent polymers that will hopefully stop them in their tracks. A gently competitive scenario now develops between the two, but that is soon changed when she discovers that one of their backers in really in it for the fire-sale value of properties devastated by the sheer power of the twisters, and - of course - the remainder of the plot follows lines way more predicable than that of the whirlwind. It's really more of a whirlwind of another sort that takes over and that's a bit of a shame as it shows up the limitations Powell as an actor. Sure, he's the boy next door you wouldn't kick out of bed for eating Pringles, but here he's about as wooden as a washboard. Edgar-Jones isn't a great deal better and the writing seems uncertain as to whether we are to watch an action-packed adventure film or a cheesy romance with some contrived moralising thrown in for good measure. To be fair, there is an attempt at bringing some science into the story and the visual effects are genuinely exciting to watch as these amazing forces of nature wreak their havoc despite man's best efforts. It's a bit on the long side, but it's still perfectly watchable especially if you can appreciate the visual on a big screen.

But wait, there is more.... I didn't want to see Twisters.  In fact I rolled my eyes at that... until the director said that they weren't going to make it about Climate Change.  I mean, that really got my hopes up.  That made it sound like it was just going to be a movie about tornadoes.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,5.0,"Taking the ridiculous to a new level, the disaster spectacle “Twisters” falls short in delivering a compelling story to match its go big or go home premise. Directed by Lee Isaac Chung, the movie plunges viewers into a relentless tornado “outbreak,” setting the stage for a half-baked sequel that’s so stupid, it’s actually a challenge to suspend disbelief.

Former storm chaser Kate (Daisy Edgar-Jones) is haunted by an encounter with a killer tornado while she was in college in Oklahoma. It was a disastrous day, and she continues to live with survivor’s guilt years later. Now living in New York City, she is lured back into the field by her friend Javi (Anthony Ramos) with the promise of testing a groundbreaking new storm tracking and mapping system. The science-minded pair meet the reckless, renegade storm chaser and social media superstar Tyler Owens (Glen Powell), who seems more concerned about getting views and likes rather than contributing anything meaningful. But as the storm season quickly intensifies, there is a scary proliferation of deadly tornadoes that leave nothing but devastation in their path.

Amidst it all, Kate and Tyler find themselves competing to be the first to document each funnel for entirely different reasons. All of this is so dumb. There’s no reason for these people to be racing to get to the tornado first, but Chung tries to create a sense of urgency and drama by pitting them against each other. The plot is straightforward: see tornado, chase tornado, repeat. While this tried-and-true formula offers fleeting thrills, it quickly becomes tedious. There’s only so much humans can do to fight back at killer forces of nature, and there are laughably idiotic scenarios like a character shooting fireworks into the funnel of a tornado just to see if he can.

Most of the film is divided between show-stopping tornado “attacks” and Powell making lovey-dovey eyes at the camera (we get it: he’s good looking)! I suppose there’s no arguing the fact that everyone loves an easy-on-the-eyes tornado wranglin’ hunk, but even his charm can’t carry the movie.

The film’s science is absolutely laughable, with tornadoes depicted as nearly sentient forces capable of reducing buildings to rubble in seconds and sucking humans into the sky while somehow sparing people’s hats.

The special effects, and especially the sound design, are impressive, creating a visceral experience of the storms’ fury. The action sequences may be visually striking, but they lack the originality and impact needed to make them memorable. What’s fun about seeing people’s homes destroyed and lives ruined?

Disaster film fans may be a bit more lenient in unearthing more to enjoy about “Twisters” than I did, because I found it to be big, loud, and dumb. Those attributes can be satisfying if they’re executede well and the story at the core of the movie is good, but this one is not. It’s heavy on the mindless, light on the fun.

Sejian,6.0,"I think I need to rewatch the old movie because I cannot remember if it was this ridiculous or not. I see there are two; the one with Bill Paxton that I think I remember and an even older one with muh boi, Crispin Glover that I didn't know exist.

So, what's wrong with this movie? Well, besides killing off Kiernan Shipka in the first 15 minutes, everything, everything is wrong (I'm exaggerating slightly) - I thought I was watching a disaster movie, instead it's a weirdly cobbled together romance movie.

MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD

1. Javi is written as an unintentional antagonist and it's kinda dumb. Furthermore, the issue between Javi and Kate is also never really addressed. They both lost their friends and for all intents and purposes it appears Kate built up walls around herself, left town and never looked back. Both of these characters have had to live with and deal with the loss of their friends but in the scene when Javi snaps at Kate, it's hard not to take Javi's side, and we're meant to take Kate's side because the movie follows Kate. Javi is barely in it. The scene that follows between Tyler and Kate felt like it should've been between Javi and Kate, minus the romance because we don't actually need romance in everything.
2. They went a little too far with ""reckless Tyler"" in those first few scenes where diving Javi and Kate off the road is played for laughs. No one ever brings it up and Javi even pulls the same stunt with Tyler and Kate during the final act. These people are all supposed to be sensible adults.
3. Apart from mini-boss Scott, Javi's team of trained specialists have no personality or character development and are given barely any screen time compared to Tyler's ragtag storm-wrangling group. We're meant to see Tyler's group as cool because ""oh whoa, they actually know something!"" while we never get to know the team of people who could probably blow your mind with their combined knowledge.
4. My biggest issue with this movie is the two ""opposing"" groups. Javi claims to be doing this for science so we can better understand tornadoes so we can help people, and Tyler's here to help people by being social media famous, selling merchandise and giving out food. They both have the same goal, or claim to, and their different tech and methods of storm chasing could compliment each other, so why the unnecessary animosity, especially from Tyler's group, who, if we're being honest, aren't really doing that much. Tyler mentions a supercomputer at one point and I have to wonder what exactly have they been using this supercomputer access for all this time? If these two clowns worked together, they could've successfully scanned a tornado before the events of this movie.

ANYWAY... LET'S GET TO THE JUICY PART OF MY ""REVIEW""!

""Is there political lecturing? No. Is there lecturing about climate change? No. Is there lectures about being Gay? No. Is there lectures about diversity? No. Is there lectures about feminism? No. Does it make a point that all white people are evil? No. Does it make a point that all men are evil? No. Does it make a point that Christianity is evil? No. Does it have a villain that is supposed to be Donald Trump? No.""

What do you suppose Kate's mom was talking about when she mentioned more and more bad weather? Bigots are comically silly, I swear! Swine says they came to watch tornadoes destroy things but somehow missed all the colored people and women on the screen who feel like they take up the majority of the runtime. There's never consistency with these people, is there?

I came to watch a disaster movie and all I left with was the thought that I should've just watched  The Day After Tomorrow (2004) again because at least that movie had compelling people drama. The funnier bit is if you read the recent reviews online on that old Bill Paxton movie, there are quite a few complaining that this new movie is woke and shoving agendas down your throat, so either Swine is being comically sarcastic or they're full of it. Like Tyler, I can't really tell.

Do bigots like it because Kate gets with Tyler at the end instead of Javi? It really does seem this simplistic and silly when simply seeing a colored person on screen usually triggers them into spiraling out of control with calls to ""boycott the woke DEI agenda movie!""",2024-09-09T21:46:28.288Z,718821,2 stars,0.4418390095233917

TheSceneSnobs,8.0,"Maxxxine is a film I have eagerly anticipated since it was teased as the final installment of Ti West's X trilogy. Having thoroughly enjoyed the first two films, I had high hopes for this one. Each film in the series brings a unique style that represents the period it’s set in.

2022’s X was a gritty homage to the brutal horror films of the 1970s, with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre being a major influence. The same year, Pearl offered an even more stylistic approach, serving as a prequel with influences from the silent era and visual nods to The Wizard of Oz. These distinct stylistic choices set a high bar for Maxxxine.

In Maxxxine, we follow the lone survivor of the farmhouse massacres depicted in the first film. Now a bit older and blonder, Mia Goth’s Maxine is still striving to become Hollywood’s next biggest star. She finally lands a role as the lead in a new horror film, but her past begins to catch up with her. She is pursued by a sleazy private investigator, played by Kevin Bacon, who works for a vicious killer targeting Maxine’s closest friends. Concurrently, Maxine must navigate the terror of the Night Stalker, who is haunting Los Angeles, while detectives try to unravel her connection to these events.

Maxxxine is a beautiful love letter to the horror films of the 1980s. Ti West draws influence from many great horror filmmakers of that era. One scene in particular, where Maxine ascends a staircase toward the film’s climax, is reminiscent of the cinematography of David Lynch films from that period. This meticulous attention to style and atmosphere enhances the film’s nostalgic appeal.

Mia Goth is truly fantastic, bringing depth and intensity to her role. Her performance is a highlight of the trilogy, showcasing her versatility as she navigates multiple characters and complex emotional landscapes. For example, her portrayal of Maxine’s relentless determination and underlying vulnerability adds layers to the character, making her journey compelling and relatable.

While Maxxxine is a strong entry in the series, it is, in my opinion, the weakest installment. The film serves as a fitting conclusion to the trilogy but leaves some unresolved threads from X. I would have appreciated more closure regarding the events of the first film, as the connections feel somewhat superficial. Additionally, the reveal of the main antagonist, while surprising, feels somewhat detached from the overarching narrative. For instance, the motivations and background of the killer are not as deeply integrated into the story as they could have been, leading to a somewhat disjointed climax.

Despite these criticisms, Maxxxine is a well-crafted horror film that offers plenty of nods to genre aficionados. Ti West has created a trilogy that honors the horror tradition while bringing fresh and innovative storytelling to the table. The film is rich with familiarities from 1980s horror, making it a nostalgic yet refreshing experience. Mia Goth’s performance ties the trilogy together beautifully, and her portrayal in Maxxxine cements her status as a standout in modern horror cinema. While the film has its flaws, it remains a fitting and enjoyable conclusion to a remarkable series.",2024-07-09T15:09:40.550Z,1023922,4 stars,0.519402027130127
CinemaSerf,6.0,"Despite her rather florid past, the eponymous porn star (Mia Goth) is determined to make it in the mainstream and seems well on her way when director ""Elizabeth Bender"" (Elizabeth Debicki) casts her as the lead in the sequel to her own successful first feature. Whilst this is all going on for ""Maxine Minx"", there is a serial killer on the loose in Los Angeles and the police seem to think that maybe she is involved. Obviously she's not the perpetrator of these vicious acts, but might she somehow be the ultimate target? A rather curious meeting with private eye ""Labat"" (Kevin Bacon) suggests that she might want to go a mysterious address where she might learn the truth, but she has her own ideas so with the help of her agent/manager/enforcer ""Teddy"" (Giancarlo Esposito) and a car crusher sets up quite a perilous face-off with a man in black gloves who lives behind a set of green doors. At times this is quite an attitudinal film and Goth does fine, but (no pun intended) Bacon just hams it up too much. Debicki seems totally disinterested in her role and the rest of the cast add very little to a story that is too thinly stretched to pad out one hundred minutes before taking us to a rather weak and rushed denouement. Beware: I sense a sequel might be in the pipe, as if we don't already have enough mediocre slasher fayre on offer already!",2024-07-10T11:36:16.733Z,1023922,2 stars,0.46503421664237976

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,6.0,"There’s a lot to appreciate about “MaXXXine,” writer/director Ti West‘s latest film in his horror trilogy, even if he doesn’t quite stick the landing. The whole project feels like, as one of his characters says in one of the film’s most memorable lines, a “B-movie with A+ ideas.” There’s plenty of blood and gore to appease slasher fanatics, but there’s a depth to the film that comes from the hefty themes about sex, opportunity, religion, and Hollywood’s dark underbelly.

Set in Los Angeles in the mid-1980s, adult film star and aspiring big studio actress Maxine Minx (Mia Goth) finally gets her big break into the mainstream. She’s been cast in a supporting role in a horror movie sequel and is set to work with up-and-coming director Elizabeth Bender (Elizabeth Debicki). Things are looking up for Maxine career-wise, but a mysterious stalker who is targeting the starlets of Hollywood seems to have her directly in his sights. When a trail of blood makes it clear that several murders are directly connected to her, Maxine starts to worry that her sinister past is going to be exposed.

The first half of the film is also the best, and West fully embraces the decadence and danger that goes along with the backdrop of sleazy Hollywood. Filmed with a vintage aesthetic and Eighties feel, the neon-lit, blood soaked movie looks like it has stepped out of an exploitation cinema time capsule. It’s an homage that’s done exceedingly well, from the cinematography to the soundtrack to the costume design.

The casting is perfect across the board, with standout performances from both Kevin Bacon as a menacing bad guy and Giancarlo Esposito as Maxine’s attorney agent, Teddy Night. (Even the supporting roles are meaty, featuring solid turns from Michelle Monaghan, Moses Sumney, Bobby Cannavale, and Sophie Thatcher). Goth is once again terrific as a shrewd woman with a fierce ambition, lending the ideal mix of street smart toughness with a relatable vulnerability. West never demeans his lead character either, which is refreshing. The film portrays sex work and the adult film industry as a legitimate profession and Maxine as a strong, empowered woman who takes charge of her own destiny.

The second half of the film derails with a conclusion that seems both corny and disappointing (at least on the surface). The ending is left open for rampant speculation, which is probably going to polarize audiences. I think it’s fun when a film can be interpreted in several different ways, but this may prove frustrating for moviegoers who like things very black and white.

Best of all, “MaXXXine” leaves plenty of room for a fourth film featuring the character, which I certainly hope we get.

tmdb51616167,5.0,"Maxxine is the third installment in a confusing trilogy of movies. After enduring the first film, X, which was essentially a low-quality adult film, and only partially watching the second film, Pearl, which was equally disappointing, I had low expectations for Maxxine.

Assuming it would follow the same pattern, I made sure no children were present before watching it alone. Surprisingly, Maxxine had less nudity, only appearing twice, compared to its predecessors. Instead, it focused more on horror and thriller elements, following an aspiring actress being stalked by a serial killer named Knight and another mysterious figure out to harm her.

While this film didn't win me over completely, I appreciated that it actually had a plot and some semblance of a storyline, unlike the previous entries in the trilogy. For those who enjoy quirky, over-the-top thrillers with unconventional writing, Maxxine may be worth a watch. However, if you prefer gripping, edge-of-your-seat thrillers, this may not be the film for you.

After viewing Maxxine, I concluded that it was not something I would revisit or add to my collection. It's the kind of movie you watch once and then move on from, ticking it off your list without a second thought.",2024-09-02T20:33:55.617Z,1023922,3 stars,0.5510187745094299

Away from the splendid Goth, Kevin Bacon is the one I liked most from the rest; he plays a successfully sleazy dude. Away from them, I wanted to see more of Giancarlo Esposito, while Michelle Monaghan and Bobby Cannavale are solid; Elizabeth Debicki too (still can't unhear Diana, mind).

The conclusion underwhelmed me, I won't lie. The reveal and just the way the plot goes in general just didn't really click with me. I wouldn't at all say it's explicitly a bad ending, it just didn't give me proper satisfaction. All in all, I did have a good time watching this and the series overall.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,3.0,"Director Rich Peppiatt‘s rowdy, frenzied film “Kneecap” is a lively biopic based on the hell-raising Irish rap trio of the same name. You’ve probably never heard of these musicians, but the film celebrates the general sense of anarchy as these young men become key figures in a civil rights movement to save their mother tongue. It’s a story about finding your voice in a world that seems determined to keep you down, all told with a slew of swear words, hip-hop tracks, and lots of drug-fueled shenanigans.

Set in West Belfast in 2019, the film depicts the origins of the group Kneecap, including insight on how they created their unique sound. In a bid to push back against the establishment, Liam Óg, Naoise Ó Cairealláin, and JJ Ó Dochartaigh (who play themselves in the film) take to the stage as a symbol of Ireland’s restless youth. They refer to themselves as “low life scum,” and their message resonates with so many. By writing and performing hip-hop songs in Irish, they become a local sensation. This garners the attention of their political martyr father (Michael Fassbender), the ire of party conservatives, and the adoration of the people.

It’s a true story that doesn’t give a ton of insight into the band members, but it’s still a lot of fun. The film features plenty of original music by the trio (which admittedly is an acquired taste), and their politically-charged rhymes and defense of their cultural heritage speak volumes. The guys write what they know, and the truth resonates with locals. It comes down to this: when cops don’t want people hearing your music, that’s when you know you’re doing something right.

The songs and the film rapidly switch between English and Irish, so it takes a lot of concentration to watch. I could see some viewers quickly giving up, but those who stick it out will be rewarded.

Liam, JJ, and Naoise are rambunctious lot, and their shenanigans are sometimes questionable but always entertaining. There are quirky bursts of humor that make the boisterous characters even more appealing. None of these guys are great actors, but it adds to the unpolished authenticity of the film.

There’s a defiant energy to “Kneecap” that is invigorating, and the story is one that’s different and original.

tmdb51616167,5.0,"""A Family Affair,"" a recent Netflix release starring Nicole Kidman, Zac Efron, Kathy Bates, and that actress from ""Kissing Booth"" whose name escapes me, is a film that could easily fall into the realm of cheesy and corny. Surprisingly though, it manages to be one of those guilty pleasure movies that you can't help but enjoy.

While it's not groundbreaking by any means, the movie is surprisingly captivating and entertaining. The story revolves around a lonely celebrity who finds love in an unexpected place, his own assistant's mother. Yes, it's a bit cliché with Zac Efron and Nicole Kidman's characters falling for each other, but there are enough twists and surprises to keep things interesting.

There are moments that are cringe-worthy, moments that are heartwarming, and moments that are just plain cheesy. But overall, the film manages to strike a balance that makes it worth watching. It may not be a masterpiece, and it's unlikely to become a favorite that you'll revisit often, but if you're looking for something to pass the time, ""Family Love"" is worth a watch.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Well it's certainly a saga! Against a backdrop of the American Civil war we are introduced to half a dozen different spokes on the wheel of pioneering America that gradually head towards a centre of what I assume will be the creation of the fabric of modern day USA by the end of part four. It begins rather brutally when a woman shoots a man then flees the scene with her infant child. Despite her proximity to the victim he survives and orders his two sons to pursue her. Meantime, there's a wagon train heading across the Apache dominated territory under the command of ""Matthew"" (Owen Wilson) and, separately, ""Hayes"" (Kevin Costner) is doing a bit of wintery horse-trading. With the younger Apache restless and determined to do what they can to thwart the encroachment on their ancient hunting grounds, they attack another white-man's settlement decimating the population. It's only after some sterling riding from the young ""Russell"" (Etienne Kellici) to a nearby army post that we meet ""Lt. Gephart"" (Sam Worthington) and his sagely ""Sgt. Major Riordan"" (Michael Rooker) who arrive to pick up the pieces amidst the charred ruins. The survivors include the terrified ""Frances"" (Sienna Miller) and her daughter ""Lizzie"" (Georgie MacPhail) whom they rescue from a tunnel in which they were hiding. The two adults immediately click perhaps offering us a glimmer of romance for the remorseful widow? Across the country, ""Hayes"" arrives in a small settlement where he encounters the good-time girl ""Marigold"" (Abbey Lee) and her young baby who just happen to be the one the avenging sons are looking for. Needless to say he, and his Colt revolver, have to come to the rescue and they decide it's better to take to the hills to avoid yet more trouble. With the forbidding west outstretched before these characters and the dangers and demons of their pasts never far behind them, the adventure is teed up for part two. To be fair, this looks great with some stunning drone cinematography illustrating really well the the scope of this virgin land that is every bit as hostile at times as those who have lived there for generations. There's also some impressive battle scenes as the maturing natives try to protects their homeland. The style of the rest of the narrative is just all a bit too bitty, though. Costner doesn't really appear until hour two and the substantial elements of the plot draw heavily from a very well established genre that it was always going to be difficult to reinvent or reimagine. The score helps it along rousingly at times and dialogue is sparingly used by most of the characters which is also quite a sensible tactic as we quickly realise we are in for just as long a slog as the settlers. It's the necessary character establishment part of this story which we can only hope will pad out the people more and rely less on the visuals as the story progresses. Otherwise, it's not really much better than a series of episodes of ""Bonanza"" bolted together.",2024-07-02T09:08:13.894Z,932086,4 stars,0.6330682039260864
r96sk,9.0,"<em>'Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 1'</em> surpassed my expectations!

A three-hour western, which is only the first of many connected entries? Yeah, that doesn't exactly set the pulses racing! Based on that, I was anticipating it to be a slow-moving set-up to future chapters. However, to my surprise this opening installment is a lot of fun. For a film of such a length, it absolutely flies by; this felt like a 2hr, max, movie to me.

My main praise for this film is directed at the pacing (evidently), the visuals and the score - the latter is particularly outstanding. I will say there are a fair few scenes that I felt could've been lit better, mainly across the opening chunk - not a big deal, though.

There are so many characters in this, some may say too many but honestly I enjoyed all the different people portrayed onscreen. Kevin Costner is very solid, though to be truthful he isn't really involved all that much in this chapter - at least to how much I was expecting to see of him. I wouldn't say there is a main standout from the cast, but I don't mean that negatively.

Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Abbey Lee, Jamie Campbell Bower and Michael Rooker are some of the notable performers, though it truly is an ensemble because I can't really separate any of them based on their performanes - which is actually a good thing. Mind you, as good as he is, Rooker's Irish accent is awful, I gotta say - rather distracting.

How annoying that we have to wait so long for the seque... oh, <em>'<em>'Horizon: An American Saga – Chapter 2'</em>'</em> drops next month! Bring it on!

TheSceneSnobs,6.0,"Kevin Costner channels his inner John Ford with his immense passion project, starting with Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1. Unfortunately, in this initial chapter, he falls short of making a lasting impression akin to Ford's timeless works. Costner serves as the film's producer, director, co-writer, and star, undertaking a monumental task. This film marks the first chapter of a four-part epic series that weaves together the lives of various characters around the territory of 'Horizon'. The saga will span 12 years, with this first film serving to introduce Horizon and its primary characters.

The ensemble cast is led by Costner himself, alongside Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Luke Wilson, and many more. While the cast is impressive on paper, the execution leaves much to be desired. The characters feel underdeveloped, and the acting often comes across as lackluster. Sienna Miller and Sam Worthington, despite their talents, struggle to breathe life into their roles, making their characters feel one-dimensional.

On a positive note, Costner's direction and the film's cinematography are commendable. The sweeping landscapes and meticulously crafted shots capture the grandeur and harsh beauty of the American frontier. His wide-angle shots of the sprawling territory and close-ups that highlight the characters' rugged determination are visually stunning, reminiscent of classic Westerns. These elements create an immersive atmosphere that is one of the film's few strengths.

The primary issue with Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1 is its role as a setup for future installments. The film feels more like an extended prologue than a standalone story. The plot is fragmented, with numerous threads introduced but few developed to a satisfying degree. 

While the film has its flaws, it lays the groundwork for what could become a compelling saga. The potential for intricate storytelling and character development exists, but it is not fully realized in this first chapter. If the subsequent films can build on this foundation and address the gaps in the plot, Horizon could evolve into an epic worth watching. However, if the pacing and character development issues persist, maintaining interest in the series may prove challenging.

Given its ambitious scope and narrative structure, Horizon: An American Saga might have been better served as a TV miniseries. This format would allow for more detailed character arcs and a more deliberate pacing, giving the story the room it needs to unfold organically. The episodic nature of television could provide the depth and continuity that the film format struggles to achieve in this case.

Overall, Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 1 is a visually impressive but narratively weak start to Kevin Costner’s ambitious project. While the direction and cinematography stand out, the lackluster acting and fragmented plot diminish its impact. The film serves primarily as a setup for future chapters, which may hold promise if they can build upon and enrich the story introduced here. As it stands, Horizon has potential, but it will need to deliver more in its subsequent installments to truly captivate its audience.",2024-07-09T15:06:09.784Z,932086,3 stars,0.5003446936607361

moviepoptime,-1.0,"""Horizon: “An American Saga – Chapter 1” does not rush anything and provides numerous storylines before fully exploring Kevin Costner’s character, an hour into the show. Speaking of the dynamics, the turn of the century setting’s epic, but gritty representation is complemented by John Debney’s touching score, even though the characters remain poorly developed, and the action almost hilariously paced.

What I noticed while watching it, is that pioneer struggles were portrayed quite realistic but I wish the characters were related more intensely. It wouldn’t be wrong to state that yes, the film’s rawness and ‘sex and violence’ do depict the given period and hence is value added to the movie through a rather raw introduction to Costner’s extended story.

Initially reluctant, she agrees to walk with him and gradually a bond develops as the environment gradually and dangerously disintegrates before them. Luckily, the monsters can't swim - so perhaps they can try to make it to the water? Obviously there's not a great deal of dialogue here, so the accumulating sense of (limited) menace is built by two actors who are adequate but who don't really have enough to work with to make this stand out. As ever, the lengths people will go to to save their pets astonishes me. Danger everywhere and yet both feel the need to risk life and limb for a moggy! Bizarre. It's difficult at the best of times to get much traction from prequels, and Michael Sarnoski doesn't really manage to develop the characters or the story beyond this ninety minutes of stand alone cinema that really has little to do with the other, far better, films from earlier in this strand.

These pictures are proof positive that edgy, spooky stories can be successfully made without having to kill off the cast or engage in spectacles of gratuitous gore. The works of filmmakers like Jordan Peele and Alex Garland exemplify this, as do the three releases in this impressive franchise. And this latest entry is, without a doubt, the best of the lot. “Day One” draws upon the mythology introduced in the series’ first two films, but it takes matters in a new, more insightful direction and does so, ironically, by way of a prequel going back to the origin of this gripping, ongoing saga. What separates this film from what preceded it, however, is that it presents yet another story in the franchise but from an entirely new angle, with new characters, a new setting, and a new, more profound, more nuanced focus. Instead of small-town America, where the first two pictures were set, this offering takes place in New York City, showing what happens when the Big Apple is attacked by the now-familiar aliens that hunt by way of sound as the means for finding their prey – and the measures that surviving humans must take to stay silent to keep from being spotted. The narrative principally follows a terminally ill poet (Lupita Nyong’o) living in hospice care who has become resigned to the fate of her impending death but now seeks to stay alive at all costs, most notably in helping a frightened Englishman living in Gotham (Joseph Quinn) and protecting her beloved (and adorable) comfort cat. These circumstances give her a new purpose at a time when she might have otherwise completely given up hope. In telling this story, the film also examines the perils of having to suddenly adjust to a “new normal” under unpredictable conditions, as well as the need for all of us to pull together in a united front in the wake of these trying circumstances. But there’s more to it than that, including metaphorical themes and symbolic imagery that truly make this more than just a horror film (and even more than just a smart horror movie at that). While it’s true the story meanders somewhat at times, it nevertheless presents viewers with a thoughtful tale, punctuated by excellent camera work, a fine soundtrack and a superb, award-worthy performance by Nyong’o. Even if you haven’t seen the two previous films in this series or have much interest in this genre, writer-director Michael Sarnoski’s second feature outing is well worth your time. It’s a smart, smart, smart film that rises far above what one might typically expect from a horror flick – and one that will leave you with a lot more than just a few good scares upon exiting the theater.",2024-06-29T04:42:20.629Z,762441,4 stars,0.5457315444946289
MovieGuys,4.0,"Nothing special. My first and enduring reaction to A Quiet Place Day One.

Perhaps the biggest shortcoming is rather flat, indifferent, cynical characterisations. ""Everything is shit...."" According to the main character. Perhaps this reflects the New York way of being? Big city rat races and so on? Suffice to say, it doesn't work. 

What made the first two films such a success was a family dynamic with people who were close and cared deeply about each other. You could empathise with them, buy into their plight, when faced with an alien other. 

Beyond this the horror/actions scenes are alright but again, because the vibe is wrong, the film just feels like its going through the motions. Its been done before yes, so whats this film adding to the equation? As far as I can see, very little.

In summary, a nice idea but the overall set up just doesn't work for me. The results ""just another"" horror action flick with a few jump scares to keep you on the edge of your seat and little else.  If you are going to build on a successful franchise you need to look ""hard"" at what made those other films such as success and inject something that is original but also taps into those elements, in a meaningful way.",2024-06-30T23:31:59.854Z,762441,2 stars,0.6285315155982971
Manuel São Bento,8.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://movieswetextedabout.com/a-quiet-place-day-one-review-where-apocalyptic-horror-meets-inspiring-thematically-rich-character-arcs/

""A Quiet Place: Day One stands out for its thematically rich, complex, universal screenplay, resuming the franchise’s exploration of topics such as the fight for survival, humanity, and the will to live, while enriching the saga with inspirational character arcs around mental, physical, and emotional health.

Michael Sarnoski displays his exceptional ability to create an apocalyptic atmosphere filled with suspense and terror at every turn, ensuring high entertainment value throughout the whole runtime. The notable performances by Lupita Nyong’o, Joseph Quinn, and Alex Wolff significantly elevate the movie, with Nyong’o, in particular, delivering a powerful, intense performance that underscores the importance of finding hope and joy amid despair.

The emphasis on the importance of emotional support animals is the cherry on top that makes this installment a valuable, moving addition to the saga.""

r96sk,6.0,"Unexpectedly, quite dull.

<em>'A Quiet Place: Day One'</em> builds some tension well and features very good sound design, though the story and its characters are a disappointment. I have no issues with Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn, they try, but Sam and Eric are written quite boringly. I felt like we were missing some major character development for both.

The plot is rather underwhelming. There is some additional meaning in there admittedly, but it's literally one lame objective and then the standard styled exit. It felt whilst watching that the movie had barely any flesh on its bones. The cat stuff is cute, though the obvious lack of true jeopardy for Frodo even hampers that from hitting for real.

There is at least a pleasing use of Nina Simone's Feeling Good. Overall, however, this left me feeling extremely meh, unfortunately. I am, it is worth noting, someone who doesn't love the original two movies; though I did like the first flick just about enough.",2024-07-05T17:11:20.684Z,762441,2 stars,0.6458113193511963
TheSceneSnobs,7.0,"Lupita Nyong'o has a talent for elevating every film she's in, and her performance in A Quiet Place: Day One is no exception. Alongside Joseph Quinn, she shines brightly in this third installment of the A Quiet Place franchise. This film breathes much-needed life into the series, which has only improved over time.

The first film introduced an interesting concept but didn’t resonate with me long-term. The second film, though bolstered by terrific performances from Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt, still left me wanting more. A Quiet Place: Day One finally delivers by taking us back to the beginning with a fresh perspective and a change in location that reinvigorates the narrative.

Setting the film in New York City was a brilliant move. The urban backdrop provides a stark contrast to the rural settings of the previous films, adding a new layer of tension and excitement. The urban environment also allows for more complex and dynamic action sequences, which are executed with precision and creativity.

Nyong'o and Quinn’s performances are standout elements. Nyong'o brings depth and intensity to her role, making every scene she's in compelling especially with no dialogue. Her ability to convey fear and determination simultaneously adds significant emotional weight to the film. Quinn complements her perfectly, and their chemistry drives the narrative forward. 

The action sequences are meticulously crafted, with each set piece building tension masterfully. The filmmakers’ use of sound—or the lack thereof—remains a powerful tool, enhancing the horror elements and keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.

Overall, A Quiet Place: Day One is a well-done horror movie that reinvigorates the franchise. The new setting, coupled with strong performances and expertly crafted action sequences, makes this installment the best yet. Lupita Nyong'o and Joseph Quinn bring new energy to the series, while the change of location to New York City provides a fresh and thrilling backdrop for the story. This film not only stands out within the series but also within the horror genre as a whole.",2024-07-09T14:30:34.927Z,762441,4 stars,0.704704225063324
tmdb51616167,7.0,"Today, I visited the cinema to watch the film Quiet Place: Day One, anticipating a thrilling and edge-of-your-seat experience. I must admit, the movie did not disappoint. While it may not be a masterpiece, it was enjoyable and engaging enough to warrant multiple viewings with the potential to discover new details each time.

Lupita Nyong'o delivers a stellar performance as the main character, portraying a patient from a hospice center who must fight for her life. She embodies the role with great skill and authenticity.

As for the main character Eric, portrayed by a British actor whose name I am unsure of, his portrayal lacks a bit in the scare factor. In a post-apocalyptic scenario where survival is key, his constant state of fear teetered on the edge of being unrealistic. Nonetheless, he manages to keep the audience invested in his character's journey.

Surprisingly, the cat in the film garners significant screen time and plays a crucial role in the story alongside Lupita's character. While the cat's lack of typical feline behaviors may be confusing, it adds a unique layer to its character and the overall narrative.

The film's setting in New York adds a touch of realism, with references to pizza that tie into the characters' circumstances. The creatures in the movie, reminiscent of those from Stranger Things, are brought to life through impressive CGI and visual effects that enhance the alien invasion storyline.

A notable aspect of the film is the inclusion of an original character from a previous installment, adding depth and continuity to the narrative. Without giving away any spoilers, Quiet Place: Day One is a film that keeps viewers engaged and entertained, making it worth a trip to the theater for multiple viewings.",2024-09-02T20:44:15.370Z,762441,4 stars,0.6312636137008667
kevin2019,8.0,"""A Quiet Place: Day One"" has a central character who is completely believable. Her name is Samira and she is terminally ill and what she is doing makes her appear to be more foolhardy than almost everyone else trapped in New York city on day one. It is not surprising she is looked upon with total incredulity when other people find out what she is attempting to accomplish in the middle of all this frightening chaos which could possibly signal the end of civilisation as we know it. The film somehow manages to successfully create a well balanced whole which doesn't lapse into a damaging split with Samira and Eric on one side of a rapidly expanding gulf and the attacking creatures on the other side with neither  combining at any point to create a coherent and satisfying whole. The opposite just happens to be true with the two distinct halves beautifully dovetailing into each other  to produce a captivating, exciting, and enjoyable film which is visually sensational and thoroughly worthwhile.",2024-12-23T01:39:27.336Z,762441,4 stars,0.5868761539459229

MovieGuys,4.0,"In hot pursuit of the latest girl boss flop that was Fusiosa, comes Trigger Warning. 

The aptly named military action flick can only trigger contempt for its fanciful story line, absurdly unrealistic action, and touting the US military as the good guys.

I don't mind Jessica Alba but this simply does not work. Its action is unrealistic with Alba throwing big men around like rag dolls. Its not helped either by a puerile, done to death back story full of cheesy, pseudo traditionalist, family and pro US military cliches.

The results wholly uninspiring and unintentionally funny, in a corny kind of way. I managed about half of this flick, before calling it a day. 

In summary, if you are going to make a girl boss action flick, at least make it a little believable. If you have a back story try showing a modicum of originality, oh and don't try telling many of us outside the US, that their military are the good guys, that ship has well and truly sailed.",2024-06-23T21:43:05.534Z,704673,1 star,0.48946866393089294
TheSceneSnobs,1.0,"2024 has been a challenging year for studio movies, with only a few standout gems amidst a sea of disappointments. Trigger Warning, starring Jessica Alba and Anthony Michael Hall, exemplifies the year's below-average offerings. This film is one of the worst I have ever seen, marred by a convoluted and disjointed narrative.

The plot of Trigger Warning is a mess, filled with bizarre and inexplicable decisions made by the characters. Jessica Alba plays a special forces commando who, inexplicably, slams her boots with each step while trying to sneak up on assailants. This odd choice undermines her character's supposed stealth and expertise.

The film’s action sequences are riddled with inconsistencies. Alba's character can effortlessly take down three armed robbers twice her size in one scene, yet is easily subdued by untrained opponents in another. These contradictions make it difficult to suspend disbelief and engage with the action. 

Anthony Michael Hall’s portrayal of the villain is equally problematic. His character is a caricature of a mustache-twirling right-wing politician, lacking any depth or nuance. Additionally, the film suffers from an overabundance of villains—four or five, with no clear connections to one another. This multitude of antagonists dilutes the narrative and makes it difficult to follow the central conflict. 

The movie tries to mimic subplots from other action films but fails to integrate them coherently. Each subplot feels disjointed and out of place, contributing to a chaotic and unfocused storyline. For example, an attempt to incorporate a redemption arc for Alba’s character is abruptly abandoned, leaving her motivations unclear and unconvincing. Every character is dull and makes poor decisions, culminating in a ludicrous climax where all the disparate plot threads collide nonsensically.

Overall, Trigger Warning is a prime example of the lackluster studio films that have characterized 2024. The film’s convoluted plot, inconsistent action scenes, and poorly developed characters make it a tedious and frustrating watch. Jessica Alba and Anthony Michael Hall’s talents are wasted in this misfire, which ultimately fails to deliver any coherent or engaging entertainment. This is one movie that is best avoided, as it offers little beyond confusion and disappointment.",2024-07-09T14:35:33.316Z,704673,2 stars,0.6880604028701782

TheSceneSnobs,6.0,"There are so many movies within the Despicable Me franchise that I've lost count of all the storylines in each. While I've never been a big fan of these movies, they at least always felt exciting. However, this fourth installment in the Gru storyline is little more than a dud. The silliness and excitement are there for younger audiences, but the film lacks heart.

One of the main problems with the Despicable Me movies is the tendency to pile on more characters just to add celebrity voices to the cast. This fourth movie is no exception. While the addition of new characters can sometimes breathe fresh life into a franchise, here it feels like a missed opportunity to develop a more heartfelt story. For instance, the introduction of a new, younger female character named Poppy as a heist partner for Gru could have been a chance to add depth. However, it might have been more impactful to see Gru partnering with his oldest daughter, who is now a teenager. This would have added a layer of connection and growth between Gru and his daughter, showcasing his evolving role as a father.

The film also introduces a subplot where some Minions are turned into a superhero team, only to be used in the movie for less than 10 minutes. This subplot feels like a wasted narrative thread that could have added excitement and depth to the story. Additionally, one of the main Minions, Ralph, is stuck on a vending machine for the entirety of the movie, reducing his role to a mere gag. This sidelining of key characters in favor of introducing new ones dilutes the emotional core that could have made the story more engaging. 

While my son enjoyed the movie, which makes sense for his age range, it’s important for these films to also entertain the parents who are watching with their children. The earlier movies in the franchise managed to strike a balance between humor for kids and clever moments for adults. This installment, however, feels more like a series of gags strung together rather than a cohesive story with emotional weight.

If there are more films in the Despicable Me series, I believe it’s time to hang it up. However, if the franchise continues, I will wait for streaming to watch them because I am not interested in seeing them in theaters. The magic that made the original films entertaining for a broad audience seems to have faded, and without a significant shift in storytelling, future installments are likely to feel just as lackluster.",2024-07-09T14:24:00.700Z,519182,2 stars,0.5140444040298462
CinemaSerf,6.0,"If it's not sacrilegious to say, I think this franchise is starting to run out of steam - the plot here isn't very original. The family ""Gru"" have a new child who doesn't much take to his father which only makes matters worse when arch-nemesis ""Maxime Le Mal"" - who is intent on turning everyone into cockroaches - escapes from custody bent on revenge on the man who put him in jail in the first place. Better safe than sorry, ""Silas"" relocates the family to a safe house where they have to pretend to fit in with the vacuous tennis club set, but one of that number - the feisty ""Poppy"" knows the secret and blackmails ""Gru"" into helping her pinch ""Lenny"" the badger from under the eyes of the diminutive ""Principal Übelschlecht"" at his alma mater. This adventure narks the headmistress and when she sees some video of the perpetrators, she's straight on to the phone with ""Maxime"" who hatches a plan to steal the baby and give him wings! The minions - and the newly formed and enhanced ""Super Minions"" - still manage to have some fun here as they discover their new home has a vending machine and an endless supply of popcorn, and there is some wit in the dialogue but the story itself is all pretty derivative and the animation looks a little too tired now. What was ground-breaking looks so much less now and the writing and characterisations are nothing special anymore.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,3.0,"The goofy Minions are on the loose again in “Despicable Me 4,” a lazy sequel that does little more to advance the franchise other than embodying the old adage of “style over substance” to a fault. There is very little here to recommend other than the first class technical achievements (the visuals are stunning, and the direction is better than expected for an animated film), making this installment feel more like a mindless baby sitter rather than a thoughtful exercise in creativity and storytelling.

Former supervillian Gru (voice of Steve Carell) is living the good life with his wife Lucy (voice of Kristen Wiig), his daughters Margo (voice of Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (voice of Dana Gaier), and Agnes (voice of Madison Skyy Polan), and new baby Gru Jr., who proves to be a handful for his daddy. Their peaceful routine is sent into chaos when the evil Maxime Le Mal (voice of Will Ferrell) and his girlfriend Valentina (voice of Sofía Vergara) escape from prison and set their sights on a new nemesis and potential target: Gru. This forces the family to go on the run and assume new identities in the suburbs.

The plot is basic and sounds like it could be a lot of fun with its fish out of water spin. Unfortunately, very little is done with the story. The film bounces back and forth with a lame narrative and cute Minions taking part in a variety of wacky, screwball antics, which may provide a good balance for adults and kids, but nothing about any of it works well. The far too simple and sparse story meanders between uninspired plot points and predictable characters arcs, never quite finding its footing. In other words, the movie is just plain dumb.

The introduction of the Mega Minions is mildly fun and entertaining, but it runs out of steam fast (I fear these characters are going to spin off into what will inevitably be another lackluster film). Everything else is a shallow gimmick as the movie struggles to maintain momentum. At least it’s true to the “Despicable Me” canon, but the film also shows that there’s only so much you can do with these characters and this universe. Move along: there’s nothing original to see here.

UWotMatez,3.0,"Felt like it wasn't sure what its own film was trying to accomplish at all. 
One minute we're watching gru back in the AVL capturing another infamous villain thats known gru since high school. Only for him to escape and supposedly hunting gru back down in revenge.. which takes only the whole movie to find him.

No joke, its like waiting for Bart or Vector to go after gru but never finding any result till the last 10 minutes. Its a VERY BORING movie. Yes its for children but the first two films I felt like both adults and kids could enjoy it. 

Even the minions were meh in this, I usually have some chuckles if not with gru and his kids/family. They felt phoned in as well. Maybe its about time we stop making these yeah?

On a side note gru has a kid who can clearly understand english which tells me hes at least 2-3. Yet his adopted children are still the exact same age? This only works in television cartoon shows I feel like, especially when time has progressed since gru and lucy have been married. Either have the girls grow up too or don't have a baby in the film as if time skipped.",2024-08-12T02:16:07.845Z,519182,2 stars,0.6247395277023315

MovieGuys,5.0,"Beverly Hills Flop Broken Axel is yet another attempt to cash in on a veteran franchise, that simply doesn't work. 

Whilst all the trapping are there, including Eddie Murphy, who has aged well, much else hasn't. The cheeky, outlandish antics of the original films, is replaced with the usual woke(DEI) hand wringing, whinging and whining. 

The daughter character, in particular, is intensely irritating. She takes empowerment and daddy issues, to a sour faced, new level, dampening down any sense of humour and fun, that could have been derived from this film. 

And that's essentially what the Beverly Hills Cop films from the 80's were, action mixed with zany, out there comedy, that showcased Murphy's quick fire intellect and wit. A lighter version, of the Lethal Weapon series, from the same era but much in the same vein. Certainly not a back drop, for heavy handed, biased, social moralising.

In summary, Eddie Murphy is as likeable as ever but so much else about this film isn't, its hard to say nice things. The incessant need to push ""the message"" takes something that should be fun and lighthearted and buries it beneath heavy morose layers of lecturing. My advice, watch the original films instead.",2024-07-08T22:56:59.756Z,280180,2 stars,0.5912174582481384
TheSceneSnobs,8.0,"To say that I was excited for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is an understatement. This is without a doubt one of my favorite franchises of all time, even including the less impressive third film. I thoroughly enjoyed this fourth installment, which sees an older Axel Foley back in Beverly Hills working a case. This time, he is up against cartels, corrupt cops, and more, led by Kevin Bacon, who threatens his daughter Jane, a Beverly Hills defense attorney.

In this film, Axel teams up with a young detective, Bobby, who is also Jane’s ex-boyfriend, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The return of franchise favorites Judge Reinhold as Billy Rosewood, John Ashton as John Taggert, Bronson Pinchot as Serge, and Paul Reiser as Jeffrey adds a layer of nostalgia that fans will appreciate.

Eddie Murphy effortlessly slips back into the character of Axel Foley, as easily as putting on his Lions varsity jacket. His performance is both charismatic and energetic, reminding us why this character became an icon. Murphy’s ability to blend humor with action is on full display, particularly in scenes where he outsmarts his adversaries with his trademark wit and cunning.

The story is fun and packed with exciting moments, and it also has a surprising amount of heart. The chemistry between the original cast members remains perfect and mixes well with the new additions. Kevin Bacon shines as a formidable antagonist, providing a worthy challenge for Axel and his team. His portrayal of a corrupt, menacing figure adds depth to the film’s conflict.

The cinematography successfully bridges the gritty feel of the first movies with the more stylistic approach of the second. The action sequences are well-executed, although some of the stunts and gags feel a bit over the top. For example, an elaborate chase scene through the streets of Beverly Hills, while thrilling, stretches the bounds of believability. Additionally, the film’s timeline contains some questionable elements that don’t quite align with the previous entries in the series. These inconsistencies, while minor, can be distracting for long-time fans.

I appreciated the film’s attempt to incorporate elements from the earlier movies, but I wish Beverly Hills Cop 3 had been integrated more thoughtfully rather than just as a throwaway joke. A more substantial nod to the third film could have added a layer of continuity and depth to the story.

Overall, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is a fun action film that fits well with the recent trend of entertaining action movies released this year. It’s impressive how the film manages to capture the spirit of the original while adding fresh elements to keep the story engaging. Eddie Murphy’s return as Axel Foley is a delight, and the film’s blend of humor, action, and heart makes it a worthy addition to the franchise. Despite some minor flaws, this movie stands out as a testament to why the Beverly Hills Cop series remains beloved by fans.",2024-07-09T14:43:11.855Z,280180,4 stars,0.6995145678520203
GenerationofSwine,1.0,"Let's be honest.... it's not as good as Beverly Hills Cop 3 and that was a mess.

But it's 2024 and by today's super low expectations for quality entertainment is seems like it's a really good movie.

Like the sequel to Coming to America, it sort of forgot that you need a story to work and can't just rely on the characters, and Eddie, he just isn't as quick as he was in I and II... both with the wit and on his feet, so it sort of falters there anyway.

But that is just a comparison.  The fact is that, if you aren't really big Fans of I and II, and if you are and have seen nothing but new movies in the past forever, it's a pretty OK film.

But it's a facade, it only comes across as good because our standards for decent film making are so pathetically low that it makes wrecks like this look amazingly well done, with a Chinatown solid script, great comedic timing, and a solid character arc.

You go back in time before Hollywood fell, and it would be getting all the criticism that came with III.

Leave 80s greats alone, Cobra Kai was the exception not the norm, and you can't capture 80s gold while making it FOR THE MODERN AUDIENCE. With MODERN SENSIBILITIES while removing the humor, characters, and plots that are PROBLEMATIC... because none of that inoffensive cookie cutter crap works today and that goes doubly so for yesteryear.

Once upon a time the good of the Beverly Hills Cop franchise outweighed the bad.  Now it's a wash.  But it's a wash that comes across as good because our expectations are so seriously low.",2024-07-09T20:39:05.974Z,280180,3 stars,0.5245884656906128
Chandler Danier,8.0,"Action movie. Sequel, universe building.

Seemed to recreate the feel of the old movies. I think Axel only drives old cars. Judge Reinhold's son bangs Eddie's daughter which is kind of like a nod to the sexual tension early in the franchise. Judging from performance, Eddie's will be the one forcing baby judge down on the couch.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,5.0,"“Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” revisits the popular franchise with the expected heavy dose of nostalgia, and thankfully Eddie Murphy‘s enduring charm overpowers the uninspired screenwriting and lackluster storyline. Filled with callbacks, familiar faces, and the iconic soundtrack that defined the 80s, this comfortable journey back to the streets of Beverly hills with the Detroit detective feels tailor-made for fans of the series.

Irreverent detective Axel Foley (Murphy) is back on the beat in the 90210 after his attorney daughter Jane’s (Taylour Paige) life is threatened. A lot of very powerful people want her to back off a case involving some very dirty cops, and she reluctantly works with her estranged dad to get to the bottom of all the threats. Axel teams up with a new local “partner” (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and old pals Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton) for help uncovering what turns out to be a big conspiracy.

It’s a formulaic and predictable plot that still serves as a solid framework for a classic crime story. Murphy effortlessly slips back into Foley’s shoes, delivering the wisecracks with that million dollar charisma that made the character a fan favorite (and himself a certified movie star). It’s fun to see Reinhold and Ashton in action again, but they are mostly there to serve up some additional ‘memberberries. Cast additions Paige and Gordon-Levitt inject some fresh energy into the mix, which, despite their characters both feeling underdeveloped, is more than welcome.

The film takes the nostalgia to the next level, including the overuse of the franchise’s best-selling soundtracks. There are three classic tunes in the opening ten minutes, which feels like a gimmick to get viewers settled into a certain mindset. It works, because this trip through familiar territory is one that relies heavily on the ability of its audience to “just go with it.” Director Mark Molloy delivers what fans expect, from serviceable action sequences, lighthearted humor, and a safe formula that is far from groundbreaking (because it doesn’t need to be).

“Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” is a good enough nostalgia-filled reunion with Murphy’s iconic character. It’s ultimately forgettable, but still provides an enjoyable ride for those looking to revisit old friends and relive the magic of the original films.

tmdb51616167,6.0,"Recently, I watched ""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F,"" a fresh adaptation and essentially a long-awaited sequel to the original Beverly Hills Cop.

Eddie Murphy truly impressed in his revival of the character, bringing him back to life on the screen, albeit the small screen this time. Despite being a streaming movie, it had the potential to succeed in theaters.

While it may not have been a blockbuster hit, it could have enjoyed some success on the big screen. However, I believe it could have been even more successful. The recasting of the daughter was a letdown for me. Her acting and storytelling towards her father felt forced and insincere, lacking authenticity and depth.

It seemed like the character was neglected in terms of development and emotional depth, which was disappointing. Despite this, the action sequences were thrilling, the storytelling was decent, and the overall plot was reasonably solid.

I wish we had seen more of her involvement in the court case, as that was a central part of the narrative. However, the focus seemed to shift primarily to Eddie Murphy's character, sidelining her story even though it was meant to be significant.

In the end, ""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"" is a decent movie. It has its moments, but it falters in certain aspects due to weak writing, especially concerning the daughter's character. Perhaps she would be better suited to smaller roles until she can enhance her emotional depth and acting skills.",2024-09-03T01:54:48.025Z,280180,3 stars,0.5915995240211487
flash82,4.0,"My username hints at my birth year. I was a child of the 1980s and movies like the Beverly Hills Cop franchise were what I grew up on.

Well, that is to say that's what I watched in the 1990s, when my country finally got around to airing Hollywood movies on free TV some 4 to 5 years after their release. It was a great childhood though, with action (+ comedy) movies that featured stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis or Sylvester Stallone. Well, I mentioned the big three, but there are a ton of others worth being added.

With this as my background, ""Axel F"" should be the blast from the past I've been waiting for all decade long. Well, you'd think so, but the early happy feelings don't last more than the moment of recognition. Seeing Eddie Murphy on screen - and reappearing in his defining role no less - was great and he looked surprisingly fit for a 60 plus actor.

But soon enough it became clear, that while the meat was there, it didn't taste right. It's the same disappointment I felt when Bruce Willis did Die Hard 4 over a decade after the third one, only more intense.

Unlike Die Hard though, this movie production was likely based on the premise of bringing the original 80s vibe back. One thing you have to ask yourself though: how could it ever *feel* authentic, when it's actually set in the 2020s? Some things are just painfully cringy, others horribly sad. Like a 60+ old Axel Foley still not having grown up, still wanting to be a street cop and instead of being that lovable screw-up he was in earlier movies, what I saw in movie number four was merely a sad empty shell of a beloved childhood character. You could almost see it in the actor's face, that he's only doing this for the money - for him the $20 million he's rumored to have earned as both producer and actor seem to be worth spitting on the legacy of this franchise. Not that the second but particularly the third movie were as good as the first one, but I still enjoyed them as a teen.",2025-01-09T16:53:34.460Z,280180,3 stars,0.404406875371933
CinemaSerf,6.0,"Danny (Mike Faist) is a would-be journalist who is interviewing Kathy (Jodie Comer) who is married to Benny (Austin Butler) who is a member of the ""Valdals"". They are a motor cycle club run by Johnny (Tom Hardy) with an almost masonic approach to looking out for each other. She takes us back to how they met, and of her nervousness about mixing with this outwardly aggressive fraternity, but as she gets to know them and they her, she begins to understand they are no threat, and that in many ways are all the family the others will have/need. As time moves on, though, the ""Vandals"" become a victim of their own success and a proliferation of chapels emerges, introducing a younger more venal and violent element to challenge the existing status quo. Using the stresses and strains of their relationship as a bedrock for the chronology, we follow the ups and downs of this disparate gang and their leader. Sadly, this isn't really a film that catches fire. It's based on real characters, and upon the book written by Danny Lyon, but ""The Wild One"" (1953) it isn't. It's often as if we are just a small fly on the wall observing their day to day routines and dependencies, but we never really get to know the characters. Comer does fine, but she really serves as little better than the narrator rather than an impassioned character increasingly concerned for her husband's wellbeing. There's also precious little dialogue from either Butler or Hardy and the rigid structure of the drama makes it quite hard to empathise with any of them, really. There is also a dearth of action here. For all the bikes, leather and testosterone we are left with just one or two scenes that raise the pulse a little - and they have been well exploited already in the trailing for the film. It's a good looking film but after all the hype, I was a bit disappointed with it's shallowness.",2024-06-26T16:39:39.151Z,1008409,3 stars,0.6941677927970886
r96sk,8.0,"It’s a bit light on story, but <i>‘The Bikeriders’</i> is a film I enjoyed.

The stellar cast list is probably the main reason, because everyone onscreen do great work. Austin Butler and Jodie Comer are the obvious standouts as leads, both are good value throughout; even if the latter’s accent is slightly grating at a few moments. Tom Hardy is, as always, terrific too, while it was awesome to see Norman Reedus appear.

As noted, I do think there’s just barely enough there for a movie - it is a plot that is stretched as far as it could possibly be. It is all shot well and all that, the bikes look and sound ace. I also like how the film wraps up. All in all, it’s very good and most certainly worth a watch.",2024-07-04T22:53:12.494Z,1008409,4 stars,0.7905794978141785
TheSceneSnobs,6.0,"The Bikeriders presents an interesting Shakespearean kind of tale, depicting the story of 'The Vandals' Motorcycle Club. The narrative captures the essence of motorcycle club culture, showcasing moments that resonate as authentic and familiar. Each scene featuring the club members is compelling, particularly those with Tom Hardy's Johnny and Austin Butler's Benny, whose performances are truly fantastic.

Tom Hardy and Austin Butler deliver standout performances that elevate the film. Hardy brings a raw intensity to Johnny, capturing the character's complexity and inner turmoil. For instance, scenes where Johnny grapples with leadership decisions reveal Hardy's ability to convey vulnerability beneath a tough exterior. Butler, on the other hand, exudes charisma as Benny, making his character's journey both engaging and poignant. His chemistry with Hardy is palpable, adding depth to their on-screen relationship.

However, Jodie Comer's character, Kathy, poses some challenges. While Comer’s acting is solid, the direction and certain choices surrounding her character are problematic. Kathy’s accent is particularly distracting, detracting from the immersion of her scenes. This is less noticeable during her interactions with the club members but becomes glaringly obvious in scenes where she talks to the photographer documenting the club. These segments, intended to provide narrative bridges or twists, feel awkwardly inserted and disrupt the flow of the story.

The decision to have Kathy narrate the story while speaking to the reporter, who is based on the real-life author of the book the film is adapted from, feels misplaced. It might have been more effective to narrate from the reporter's perspective or tell the story in a straightforward manner. For example, a linear narrative would have maintained continuity and made the time jumps less jarring. The disjointed structure often breaks the momentum, making it difficult to stay fully engaged with the plot.

Despite these issues, the core story of The Bikeriders remains compelling. The film captures the camaraderie, conflict, and emotional highs and lows of life within a motorcycle club. The writing, though disjointed due to the non-linear timeline, still conveys the drama and intensity of the characters' lives. A more linear approach could have enhanced the storytelling, providing a clearer and more cohesive narrative arc.

Overall, The Bikeriders is a film with a lot of potential, highlighted by outstanding performances from Tom Hardy and Austin Butler. Their portrayal of Johnny and Benny injects the film with energy and emotional depth. However, the film is hampered by narrative choices and distracting elements, such as Kathy’s accent and the fragmented timeline. While these issues don't entirely diminish the story's impact, they do detract from the overall experience. The film is worth watching for its strong character portrayals and the authentic depiction of motorcycle club culture, but it could have been more powerful with a more straightforward narrative approach.",2024-07-09T15:04:28.103Z,1008409,3 stars,0.6233704686164856

It's well done. Acted. Good to see Michael Shannon. I enjoyed it but I don't know if I recommend it. Seems pointless. Maybe: Accept and don't be mean to the youth else they'll murder you when they take over. Bikes are cool.",2024-07-12T03:06:09.307Z,1008409,3 stars,0.39963266253471375
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,8.0,"“The Bikeriders” offers a gritty and atmospheric portrayal of a Midwestern motorcycle club’s transformation over a decade, capturing both the allure and peril of a subculture defined by rebellion and camaraderie.

Written and directed by Jeff Nichols, the film delves into themes of loyalty, brotherhood, and the evolution of identity amidst a changing America, and features terrific performances from Jodie Comer, Austin Butler, and Tom Hardy. While not a true story, the movie is inspired by a 1963 photo essay and book by Danny Lyon, a photographer who spent time with the Chicago Outlaws riding club in an effort to document the life and times of the American biker. Nichols creates a fictional world inspired by a culture that was a very real part of the Sixties.

Set against the backdrop of a tumultuous era in American history, the film introduces bad boy Benny (Butler), a newcomer to a local motorcycle club called the Vandals. Led by the enigmatic Johnny (Hardy), the club initially serves as a sanctuary for misfits and outsiders seeking a sense of belonging in a world that seems to have left them behind. In other words, Benny fits right in. Most of the narrative revolves around his complex relationship with the strong-willed Kathy (Comer) and the tug of war that ensures between Benny’s allegiance to the club and his feelings for his old lady.

It’s a story of love, loyalty, identity, and brotherhood that’s filled with power struggles and eventual violence, and Nichols captures the heart of his narrative as the club and its members undergo a transformation that spans roughly a decade. The evolution of the characters can sometimes feel a little too predictable, but Nichols captures the spirit of the time with a sometimes-subtle (and sometimes not) exploration of the motorcycle club subculture and its various intricacies and complications.

One of the more surprising things I liked about this film is how it romanticizes masculinity in a way that’s reminiscent of classic Hollywood. Benny is a Brando type, with a rugged individualism that’s more muted than overpowered with a showy bravado. These are rugged, tough men, who abide by an unspoken code of brotherhood. It not only makes the characters more appealing, but it also adds to the authenticity.

Nichols visually captures the essence of his film’s setting too, immersing viewers in a world where leather-clad riders navigate the open road despite the turbulent dynamics within their own ranks. The production design and cinematography are a perfect fit, both working in tandem to enhance the gritty realism of the biker world and the allure of rebellion.

Anchored by solid performances and a nostalgic portrayal of American masculinity, “The Bikeriders” gives an effective and entertaining look at motorcycle culture.

garethmb,-1.0,"The wizards at Pixar have crafted a new gem with “Inside Out 2” which is a rare achievement in that it is a sequel that outdoes the original film.

The movie opens with Riley (Kensington Tallman), just after her 13th Birthday as Joy (Amy Poehler) recaps her accomplishments and sets the stage for her big Hockey Game with her friends Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green).

Their success on the ice attracts the attention of the coach of the local Firebirds who invites the trio to a three-day camp which will set the stage for them to be included on the team as freshmen.

Things take a turn when a Puberty alarm goes off followed by a construction crew to upgrade the console. Fear (Tony Hale), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Liza Lapira), and Sadness (Phyllis Smith),  do not react well to this and the arrival of the new emotions Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui  (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter-Hauser), sets the stage for new conflicts.

Riley arrives at camp and becomes enchanted with the popular girls who are fronted by Valentina (Lilimar), and Riley excludes her friends as a chance to be part of the in-crowd.

The new emotions set a course to keep Riley safe from her potential future issues and banish the old emotions that they view as hindering Riley and setting a path for future failure.

Forced to travel to the furthest reaches of Riley’s mind to recover something of necessity; the old emotions hope to undo the damage being done and restore Riley who is in the turmoil of being a teen and hampered by the flood of new and often conflicting emotions and circumstances that she encounters.

The movie is filled with charm and humor as well as presenting an honest look at the changes and pressures that children face during their teen years and does so without being heavy-handed. The emotions new and old are great and there are many moments throughout the film that will bring laughter as well as nostalgia for adults; especially those with children who are about to enter their Teen years.

The film is moving and there were more than a few eyes welling up near the end of the film during our screening as Pixar has once again crafted an enjoyable and relatable tale that can be enjoyed by the entire family.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"I really quite enjoyed the first of these (2015) but I struggled a bit to stay engaged with the one. ""Riley"" is still happily coasting through family life until one day, she embarks on the yellow brick road that is puberty. Towit, her control gallery is no longer the purview of just her lifelong guides like ""Fear"", ""Joy"" and ""Anger"" - now she has also to deal with the likes of disgust, envy, boredom and worst of all - anxiety. It's maybe the latter that the film should be called as we now embark on quite a humourless swipe at the culture of validation that young people must navigate. It's all about being popular. Being liked. Being the best - in the ice hockey team. Old loyalties go under the bus in favour of new aspirations and yes, much of it does ring quite true as an evaluation of the fickleness in all of us. Thing is, though, there's just too much inevitability about what comes next and there's way too much incessant dialogue. ""Anger"" has some fun along the way, and there is the odd comedy one-liner from the laconic ""Ennui"" but it just didn't resonate with me at all. The animation is standard Pixar fayre that does the job colourfully but unremarkably, and by the conclusion I was hoping there was an off button on that great big console. Yep - I'm probably too old to really appreciate this the way the kids can, but the trick for these studios has to be to engage the adults at the same time as the weans, else out come the mobile phones as our own version of ennui sets in.

MannyD,-1.0,"Poor Pixar! They just haven't been able to catch a break this decade! Having a majority of their originals dumbed on Disney+, Lightyear flopping, and Elemental just barely managing to make a comeback after having the studio's worst opening yet. They just can't catch a break, specially with Disney laying off their animators and refusing to let them make any originals anymore. Safe to say, they've had it rough! But Inside Out 2, despite many things working against it actually managed to be good, in fact great! Almost as good as its predecessor. I'm not gonna fully say it's a masterpiece like any of their older films, or even films like Soul or the first Inside Out, but it's still a pretty great movie! A movie that honors the original while adding to the original's themes. Instead of just being the first movie again, they actually do things a little different, by adding new emotions, covering the themes of puberty and anxiety, and adding some new locations. I also like how they don't just reset Joy back to the way she was in movie 1, they actually stick to her character development, letting the others help her, especially Sadness, and being open to new ideas. She's still flawed, of course, but it's more still growing as a character rather than just learning the same lesson again. They even subvert the originals message. Inside Out 1: it's okay to not be happy. Inside Out 2: It's okay to let happiness in. You are valued and you are good enough. There's also one scene in the movie : the panic attack. I won't spoil what happens but I really love how this scene played out. Altogether, a pretty solid film that builds on the original ti the point where I'd actually say I'd be open for a 3rd movie, something I thought I'd never, ever say ever!!! Congrats, Pix! U made a good sequel, keep it up!

TheSceneSnobs,8.0,"When I first heard about the sequel to Inside Out, I approached it with a mix of excitement and apprehension. The original film is a masterpiece, one of Pixar’s finest achievements, seamlessly blending humor, emotion, and a profound understanding of human psychology. Given Pixar’s recent uneven track record, I feared that the sequel might not live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. However, I am delighted to report that isn't the case here.

I can confidently say that Inside Out 2 is a worthy successor to the original. It almost reaches the same level of excellence, taking the story in a fresh direction with a new cast of characters that enrich the narrative.

The sequel introduces a beautifully nuanced character: Anxiety, portrayed by Maya Hawke. Hawke’s performance brings a sympathetic depth to the role, making Anxiety a character that audiences can relate to and care for. The character adds a layer of complexity to the story that resonates on multiple levels. Anxiety's interactions with Joy, played masterfully once again by Amy Poehler, highlight the inevitable struggles of growing up. Poehler’s Joy continues to be the heart of the film.

The story’s emotional core remains as powerful as ever. As a father, the original film spoke to me deeply about understanding and acknowledging my children's emotions all by extension. This sequel shifts the focus inward, reflecting the internal emotional landscape of adolescence and early adulthood. Riley, our protagonist, is growing up, and the introduction of more complex emotions reflects the reality of her development. The film brilliantly captures the awkwardness and discomfort of this transition, making it relatable for both younger audiences and adults.

Some interactions in the film are cringe-worthy because they are so true to life. We've all experienced moments of anxiety and self-doubt, and seeing them portrayed so authentically on screen is both uncomfortable and cathartic. 

Amy Poehler's portrayal of Joy remains a highlight, and Maya Hawke’s Anxiety is a beautifully crafted antagonist who evolves throughout the film. By the end, Anxiety isn’t just a source of conflict but a character that facilitates growth and understanding. This development adds depth to the narrative, making it more than just a children’s film but a profound exploration of emotional growth.

Inside Out 2 is a summer movie that stands as a high point for family entertainment. It balances humor and emotion with a storyline that speaks to both children and adults. Pixar has once again delivered a film that not only entertains but also enlightens, reminding us of the importance of understanding and embracing all our emotions. For anyone who loved the first film, this sequel is a must-watch, capturing the same magic while exploring new emotional territory.

If you cherished the original for its insightful portrayal of emotions, you will find Inside Out 2 a worthy and enriching continuation of Riley’s journey. It’s a film that promises to be both a hit with families and a valuable conversation starter about the complex world of emotions.",2024-07-09T14:21:50.441Z,1022789,4 stars,0.7022990584373474

moviepoptime,-1.0,"Inside Out 2 is a suggestion to follow Riley’s troubles during adolescence, which adds new characters to this animated movie – Anxiety and Envy, – besides Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust. Both animation and voice acting are great, and the animation properly shows the confusion and disorder of a teenage girl’s mind. Compared to ‘Toy Story 2,’ it may not be as rich in genuine sentiment, but it returns all viewers, children, and adults, to the challenge of the act of growing up.

I also enjoyed the comedy and the themes present in it and maybe because of the continuous showings or better comprehension of it allowed me to have less of a feeling compare to the first one although at some parts it is sort of teary. It was interesting to see how Joy and Anxiety interacted with each other these characters are more real in terms of showing us how emotions work during decision-making when you’re in trouble.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Now my Irish geography isn't brilliant, but even I know that to drive from Galway to Belfast takes about four hours and does not involve any forest tracks. Nevertheless, pet shop worker ""Mina"" (Dakota Fanning), who is still coming to terms with a not very recent tragedy, sets off with her rare yellow bird only for her car to break down in the middle of an ancient forest. With no phone reception, she decides to leave her car and taking the caged bird with her, proceeds to wander through the trees shouting help! Pointless? Well no, as it happens, because she luckily encounters ""Madeline"" (Olwen Fouéré) who lives in a large concrete bunker with ""Daniel"" (Oliver Finnegan) and ""Ciara"" (Georgina Campbell). It appears that they have all been stranded in the woods and take shelter after sunset from the ""watchers"". These are mysterious creatures who like to come and watch their guests, via a great big one-way mirror, for a while each night. ""Mina"" is determined to escape and with the help of ""Daniel"" reckons she has a plan, but this just irritates their captors to the point that their ""coup"" is no longer safe. Hey, but wait - there's a submarine hatch in the floor, and when they go down they discover a lot more about who their enemy are, what they want and just who built this equivalent of a nuclear fall out shelter under the trees. Can they use this information to escape the trap and make it to freedom? At times it is quite menacing with their dark and wooded surroundings adding a degree of malevolence to an antagonist that we never really see and whose Gaelic mythological provenance is disappointingly undercooked. It has a go at ending a few times, but then comes back to add a little more to signal what I thought was that there'll be a sequel along shortly, rather than finish the adventure completely. It's not terrible, and Fanning delivers adequately - as does the gorgeous yellow bird, but you'll never remember it.",2024-06-14T10:09:59.750Z,1086747,3 stars,0.5747241973876953
TheSceneSnobs,4.0,"The Watchers marks Ishana Night Shyamalan's directorial debut, with her father, M. Night Shyamalan, serving as a producer. For her first feature film, Ishana adapts the book The Watcher into a movie. The story centers on Mina, a U.S. immigrant living in Ireland, who works at a pet shop. She is sent to the countryside to make a delivery, only to find herself stranded in the middle of a forest. Seeking refuge, she discovers an old building with three walls and a window. She meets three other people who inform her that she cannot leave because 'The Watchers' are always watching and keeping them there.

The visual style of the film is impressive, showcasing Ishana Night Shyamalan's potential as a director. The atmospheric setting of the forest and the eerie, partially ruined building effectively create a sense of isolation and tension. 

Despite its strong visual elements, the story itself falls short. The plot feels longer than necessary, with certain elements that don’t always make sense. The pacing drags in places, causing the suspense to wane rather than build.

The acting is another weak point. The performances come across as stale, with characters making choices that often seem illogical and uninspired. Mina’s interactions with the other stranded individuals lack depth and emotional resonance, making it hard to connect with her plight. The other characters also fail to leave a lasting impression, contributing to the overall sense of disengagement.

The themes of isolation and surveillance have the potential to be compelling, but they are not fully realized in this film. The concept of being constantly watched by an unseen force could have been used to create a more intense psychological thriller. However, the execution falls flat, resulting in a narrative that feels disjointed and unconvincing.

Overall, The Watchers is a visually striking film that ultimately fails to resonate on a deeper level. While Ishana Night Shyamalan shows promise as a director with her ability to create atmosphere and tension, the film is let down by weak performances, a disjointed story, and lackluster character development. It’s a forgettable film that doesn’t leave a lasting impact. However, I am looking forward to seeing Ishana’s next directorial outing, hoping she can build on her strengths and deliver a more cohesive and engaging film in the future.",2024-07-09T14:41:07.255Z,1086747,3 stars,0.5024003386497498

CinemaSerf,7.0,"I'd completely forgotten about ""Bad Boys for Life"" (2020) but luckily there are were few flashbacks to remind me that ""Mike"" (Will Smith) had been the target of a son he didn't know about - ""Armando"" (Jacob Scipio) - and that both he and partner ""Marcus"" (Martin Lawrence) risked life and limb to get him behind bars. Well now, a few years later, ""Mike"" has just got married; ""Marcus"" has had a revelatory out-of-body experience and their beloved ""Capt. Howard"" (Joe Pantoliano) has been killed. The authorities become increasingly convinced that he was on the take from the drugs cartels. $20m in your bank account can arouse some suspicions - though the Porsche and beautiful waterside home of ""Mike"" might have too! Anyway, our duo are having none of these scurrilous allegations and decide to investigate. ""Howard"" expected some sort of disaster, so has left the pair some breadcrumbs that lead them to suspect that there is someone close to them who is corrupt. With the body count piling up, they turn to the incarcerated ""Armando"" who thinks he may be able to identify the ringleader. That just makes him a target too - so pretty soon it's a nimble, deadly and quite grumpy triumvirate who are on the trail of the murderers. From now on we have a standard and predicable action adventure with loads of lively pyrotechnics, car stunts and an hungry albino crocodile to accompany some quite witty repartee between the two men who are clearly very much at ease in each other's company. There's a bit of eye candy from Alexander Ludwig and the underused Vanessa Hudgens and the pace of the drama builds to a denouement that works well enough whilst screaming sequel at us loudly. It's nothing at all new, but is an engaging exercise in on-screen charisma and I did quite enjoy it.",2024-06-07T07:23:27.615Z,573435,3 stars,0.47388190031051636
r96sk,7.0,"For a fourth outing, <em>'Bad Boys: Ride or Die'</em> still finds a way to produce the goods.

I enjoyed what I watched. The previous installment remains the clear standout of the series comparatively speaking, though I was pleased to see this one still deliver the nessacary entertainment; it's perhaps my second favourite from the franchise. It does have flaws of course, like I'd say it's more serious than humourous and the more sincere stuff doesn't always hit as intended; especially the bits about Howard.

Still, there's enough positive humour in there. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence continue to please in the lead roles, they are a great match. The rest of the cast are all decent enough, Ioan Gruffudd plays what feels like a typical Ioan Gruffudd character well. Jacob Scipio, meanwhile, is pretty solid.

I will say, though, that Rhea Seehorn is underused - she's way too good for these sorta bit part roles! There are also cameo-esque appearances from Tiffany Haddish and DJ Khaled, which sounds bad on paper but, actually, both of their scenes are actually quite amusing! Away from those onscreen, camera work and editing are both pluses.

Do we need a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? No. Would I watch a fifth <em>'Bad Boys'</em> film? Yes. Yes I would.",2024-06-27T22:43:26.052Z,573435,4 stars,0.5737419128417969
TheSceneSnobs,7.0,"I didn’t know what to expect going into the fourth installment of one of my favorite buddy cop franchises. Having seen the first movie in theaters at age 13, I grew up with this series and had my doubts about its ability to evolve. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised.

This film was a joy to watch, even though it was missing Theresa Randle, whose absence was felt. Despite this, the filmmakers managed to capture the heart and spirit that fans have come to love. The narrative remains engaging, and seeing these characters return was a real treat.

The film experimented a lot with camera techniques and visual effects. While some of these choices didn’t resonate with me, they reflect a bold attempt to refresh the series. For instance, there are several action sequences that use innovative camera angles and CGI that might feel overdone, but they also add a new layer of excitement. This experimentation is evident in a particularly intense chase scene where the dynamic camera work heightens the tension, even if it occasionally feels a bit disorienting. Definitely A LOT of Neon.

One concern I had from the trailer was the Reba McEntire joke, which seemed lame out of context. However, within the film, it actually pays off in a funny and unexpected way. This moment exemplifies how the film often exceeds expectations, taking seemingly minor elements and turning them into memorable highlights.

The heart of the film and its story align well with what fans love about the franchise. The camaraderie and banter between the leads are as sharp as ever, providing both laughs and heartfelt moments. For example, a scene where the partners reminisce about their first case together brings a touch of nostalgia while reinforcing their enduring bond.

Overall, this fourth installment is a pretty good sequel that honors the legacy of its predecessors while introducing fresh elements. Despite some reservations about the new visual styles, the film’s core strengths—its characters and story—remain intact. If you are a fan of the genre and especially this franchise, you’ll likely find much to enjoy here. The film strikes a balance between innovation and familiarity, ensuring that both longtime fans and new viewers can appreciate its charms.",2024-07-09T14:29:25.423Z,573435,4 stars,0.8161154985427856
GenerationofSwine,1.0,"We liked Bad Boys because it was Lethal Weapon in Miami, and we like Lethal Weapon because it was just like the other 356 buddy cop movies we saw before it.  It's a timeless LCD flick that you're going to go and see because you know it delivers....

... the thing is, it didn't.  This one took itself a bit too seriously.  It had to, the actors are a bit too old to be on the money like with were in the first two...

... well Martin is, Will I think can still pull off the action bit.  He's clearly still in good shape.

But a lot of the comedy is absent, a lot of the bickering is gone, and we like buddy cop movies because we like the humor and we like seeing two hard men bickering like an old married couple...

... because men who have known one another forever tend to bicker like that and it's always fun to watch and listen to even when it's not in an action movie setting.

And frankly, they lost sight of that too.

So what is left is a buddy cop movie that forgot a lot of the tropes of the buddy cop movies... and that just doesn't work.  We watched Bad Boys because it was Lethal Weapon, and we watched Lethal Weapon because we liked the other 789 buddy cop flicks we saw before it.

But... again, it's 2024, our expectations are so low that we will let this slide and think it's great because, honestly, modern movies suck and this one didn't suck as hard.

So back to 1995 when they remade Lethal Weapon and brought in elements from Miami Vice and... yeah, the movie still wasn't great, but it was really fun and entertaining and that is what counted.",2024-07-09T21:07:14.248Z,573435,3 stars,0.46545636653900146

The downsides, in short order, include a rapper gangsta vibe, that's overcooked to the point of cultural cremation. Its no helped by humour, that's, for most of this film, rarely even remotely funny. 

The upside is what you would expect, polished and unrelentingly, over the top action, which, taken on its own, is entertaining. Backed by a serviceable, if basic, story.

In summary, if you can look past the gangster, rapper bombast, Bad Boys, Ride or Die, is an enjoyable, synapse neutral, action flick, for a slow day or evening.Worth a look.",2024-07-16T00:33:39.467Z,573435,3 stars,0.7075214385986328
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,9.0,"I had an absolute blast watching “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” the fourth installment in the popular buddy comedy / action franchise that started off with a bang way back in 1995. Co-directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, back at the helm after 2020’s “Bad Boys for Life,” pay homage to the “Bad Boys” legacy while injecting new life into it. As a longtime fan, this film actually over delivers. It is everything I wanted and more. I feel like the word-of-mouth on this movie is going to be electric and if audiences decide to show up, it very well could be the movie that saves the summer box office.

When their former Captain and friend Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano) is implicated in a corruption scandal involving a dangerous cartel, Miami police officers Marcus (Martin Lawrence) and Mike (Will Smith) have to work to clear his name. After a series of unexpected events, the partners find themselves on the other end of the law. Now on the run as wanted criminals (and on a hit list of local gangs), Mike and Marcus must stay ahead of the cops and the cartel while rushing to solve the mystery of who wants to frame the late Captain Howard. With danger closing in and not knowing who to trust, the men must rely on their wits, their friendship, and their street-smart instincts to survive.

There is a lot that works well here, starting with a strong story where the stakes are high, the danger feels real, and the villain is formidable. The plot, which isn’t loaded with silly twists and turns, is actually plausible. It’s a rare combination in what could’ve been just another mindless summer blockbuster, and there’s a lot more meat on the bones, narrative-wise. The film also rekindles a love for what I now consider modern iconic characters. Marcus and Mike may be older, but their banter, camaraderie, and comedic timing all still feel relevant. Most of this is due to Smith and Lawrence being a terrific pair, bickering with a natural chemistry that comes across as effortless. You believe these two guys would give their lives for each other, which makes the story even stronger. It is such a pleasure to see these two back together again.

The R-rated action is among the best of the franchise, too, from high-speed chases to intense, bloody shootouts. There are a series of inventive scenes that are expertly choreographed and storyboarded, and it’s been a while since I’ve seen such fresh and original action sequences like the ones here. The creativity sets (and hits) a higher bar, and El Arbi and Fallah’s contemporary directorial approach is stylish, energetic, and results in adrenaline-fueled action scenes that are so well done that the film is a literal heart pounder. This is one of those stand up and cheer type of films that’s best experienced with an audience that’s also fired up to be there.

I absolutely loved everything about “Bad Boys: Ride or Die.” It’s the type of action film that’s done so well, you’ll leave the theater feeling that overwhelming sense of exhilaration that can only be described as a Hollywood high. If you love the genre, make it a priority to go see this one.

Chandler Danier,9.0,"Good job, Bad Boys. You're gonna make a satisfying film when I come for you. 

I kind of ignored the first hour and a half but definitely the first hour. It might be for the best but Lawrence is good. Will is good. But they're also bad.

I like the spiritual overtones and comedy. Satisfying buddy comedy. The drones are sweet. I liked the AI camera effects. The psycho killer younger guys are good. Insane violence at the end. Seemed so PG until you hit the violence and there is so much celebration of violence. Maybe I missed some previous violence but it seemed quite intense and sudden.

I hope they make a sequel with the psychos. Grandpas can Denzel some guys. Hopefully they'll match their speech with the rest of the graphic content. All the humour is so tame. I hear you get to say more shit when you get old. BBCU4L",2024-07-23T03:22:26.129Z,573435,3 stars,0.5299477577209473
Per Gunnar Jonsson,6.0,"I will not deny that I found this movie somewhat entertaining. Maybe even fairly entertaining.

This mostly comes from the action and a few entertaining humorous scenes splattered across the movie.

However, it could have been so much better if the script had not been written by the usual bunch of low IQ Hollywood hacks.

Most of the humor is just unintelligent and cringeworthy. Marcus Burnett is simply nonsensically silly most of the time. His feeding nonsense followed by this ridiculous “I am immortal” crap and rubbish dream scenes were not funny at all but rather dragged down the movie.

The attempt to create drama by making Lowrey have psychotic episodes which ruined the mission and action on several occasions was also totally unnecessary in my opinion.

The bad guy started off really good with the first scenes where the entire plot is set up. Then however, he just became your average Hollywood villain. The initial badass bad guy vibe was never developed.

The script itself is a classical Hollywood action script. That is, it is simple, very predictable, unrealistic with lots of plot holes and really just a rehash of something done a million times.

However, in this context, it was not bad. It was certainly good enough for this type of movie.

This could have been a really good movie if the task of coming up with a script had just been given to someone with some actual talent.

As it stands this is just a somewhat (maybe even fairly) entertaining Hollywood action movie.",2024-10-26T12:44:03.249Z,573435,2 stars,0.42102017998695374
Ahmetaslan27,4.0,"**A Villain Without Depth, A Plot Without Weight – Ride or Die Stumbles**

The title of the movie has little to do with the actual plot—a point many have noted before.The story follows Mike Lowry and Marcus Burnett, as they face major life changes. Mike finally settles down and gets married, while Marcus undergoes a temporary health crisis that shifts his outlook on life. Amidst this, a shocking revelation emerges: new evidence suggests their late former boss, Captain Howard, was corrupt and involved with Mexican drug cartels. Unsurprisingly, Mike and Marcus refuse to believe this accusation.

I wasn’t excited about this movie for several reasons, one being my dislike for the previous movie. Since the directors, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, remained the same, I didn’t expect significant improvements. The movie starts off well by avoiding a major flaw from the last one—the jarring shift between serious and comedic tones. Will Smith, despite my overall disappointment with the movie, delivered an energetic performance, and his comedic timing felt genuinely sincere.

However, the story itself is underwhelming and below average. The premise—a beloved former police captain’s reputation being tarnished—lacks depth, and the explanation for his alleged corruption is unconvincing. The plot feels incomplete, and both the beginning and ending are mediocre, which is a significant drawback.

Another issue lies in the villains. The antagonist in this film is poorly written and unconvincing—evil simply for the sake of having a villain, rather than being a well-developed character. This weakens the movie further.

Ultimately, it seems the filmmakers assumed audiences would watch simply because it’s another Bad Boys movie, not because of a compelling story. The characters lack depth, the plot offers nothing new, and no fresh dimensions are added to the franchise.",2025-07-13T20:31:55.520Z,573435,2 stars,0.6422758102416992
CinemaSerf,6.0,"This latest effort from the quirky imagination of Yorgos Lanthimos employs the services of Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons and Willem Dafoe in varying roles across three short stories that question just about every aspect of human behaviour and attitudes. The first (my favourite) sees Plemons as ""Robert"". He is an outwardly professional man who lives with is wife ""Sarah"" (Hong Chau) and works for ""Raymond"" (Dafoe). He has just recovered from a very slight car accident - and on meeting with his boss we discover a little more of just what that was about and of the somewhat curious nature, and dependencies, of their relationship. The second didn't engage with me so well as cop Plemons is ""Daniel"" struggling to deal with the loss of his wife ""Liz"" at sea. When she turns up somewhat unexpectedly, she appears completely different somehow and some fairly ghastly sacrifices are soon necessary before anyone can see any light at the end of this emotional maelstrom of a tunnel. Finally, the two share the leads more looking for the ideal candidate for a cult run by ""Omi"" (Dafoe). Candidate for what? Well so long as she is the right weight and her breasts are equidistant from each other and her navel, then it'd doesn't seem to matter... Thing is, she has an estranged husband (Joe Alwyn) and a daughter who are keen to have her back - and he is prepared to use some fairly ghastly methods to see she is ""contaminated"". The scenarios are quite hard to describe. They are surreal in places, brutal in others - but I found rarely entertaining. We are presented with the façades of characterisations but it's the questions their escapades pose to us that is more interesting. What might we do to satiate our cravings for love, affection and a sense of feeling needed? How easily led we can be. The things a person will do for a tennis racket smashed by John McEnroe in 1984! It's not that it blurs lines of sexuality. There aren't any. It's sexually fluid and frequently presents us with an environment where people behave according to instinct and not societal morals. Dafoe takes the acting plaudits for me, his ownership of his roles is unnervingly creepy at times. Stone, though, seems to be resurrecting her ""Pretty Little Things"" (2023) style of characteristic (lots of racing around taking short steps) and Plemons is adequate enough, but somewhat just a little too anodyne with roles that ought to have taken us more by the scruff of the neck. It also didn't really resonate with me as a comedy either. I could see where the humourous elements were supposed to be but I prefer my humour more subtle - these punches just didn't land well enough. It's a long old watch, and though at times I did enjoy it, I doubt I'd bother again.",2024-07-02T09:51:07.621Z,1029955,4 stars,0.47080644965171814
Brent Marchant,7.0,"I’m going to say up front that this is a film I’m probably going to be processing for quite some time. The latest offering from writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos – best known for films like “The Lobster” (2015), “The Favourite” (2018) and “Poor Things” (2023) – is as much a puzzle as anything else. Told in three loosely interlaced stories with mostly the same cast members playing different roles in each, the film primarily deals in explorations of control and abuse examined from various angles. The individual stories plumb an array of additional subjects, including life, death, sanity, religion, cult membership, sexuality, dreams, surreality and self-indulgence, among others, most of which are tinged with exceedingly dark, macabre, cynical, satirical humor (evident even in its title) very much in the same vein as one of the filmmaker’s other, more troubling releases, “The Killing of a Sacred Deer” (2017). Unlike that mess of a picture, though, “Kinds of Kindness” is somewhat more coherently structured, both in its individual segments and overall, even though the finished product still has an overly cryptic eccentricity that could have benefitted from better delineated refinement. To be sure, “Kindness” has its strong points, such as its sardonic humor that may often have you giggling at things that you probably think you shouldn’t be laughing at. It also has strong performances from many of Lanthimos’s regulars, including Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe and Margaret Qualley, along with newcomers Hong Chau and Jesse Plemons, winner of the Cannes Film Festival Best Actor Award (though I can’t help but wonder what effect this film may have on the future of their careers, talent notwithstanding). And, much to my surprise, the pacing is fairly well sustained for a movie with a 2:45:00 runtime, probably because it holds viewer attention well, leaving audiences perpetually wondering where each of the vignettes is going next. On the downside, however, its graphic imagery, explicit sexuality, extreme violence and other questionable story elements may easily turn off some members (myself included at times), particularly when they push the limits of acceptability (sensitive viewers take note, especially animal lovers). So the bottom line questions here would be, “Did I like it?” and “Would I recommend it?” Well, that depends on how open one is to edgy content that clearly pushes the envelope. To be honest, there are things about this offering that I truly liked, but, then, my tastes tend to be more open-ended than those of many more conventional moviegoers. Because of that, however, this may consequently be seen as the kind of picture that many of those same audience members might find unduly troubling and offensive, readily labeling it as such and claiming that this is the sort of movie that gives many reviewers a bad name (and they probably wouldn’t be entirely wrong in saying that). Lanthimos has certainly pushed limits in many of his previous works, such as “Poor Things,” “The Lobster” and “The Favourite,” but the edginess of those releases had a playful, warmer, more whimsical feel to them than this outing, which is much more akin to the disturbing shadowiness of a film like “Sacred Deer.” Keep all of the foregoing in mind if you’re contemplating a screening of this one. And, in any event, if you come away from it outraged, disappointed or confused, don’t say you weren’t warned.",2024-07-05T23:49:00.596Z,1029955,4 stars,0.3564389646053314
TheSceneSnobs,2.0,"I have only walked out on one other film in my life. It was warranted then and warranted when I walked out on Kinds of Kindness. I enjoyed Yorgos Lanthimos's previous film, Poor Things, also starring Emma Stone and Willem Dafoe. In my opinion, that film is a shining star in his filmography. Before that, I found most of his work to be beautiful and intriguing in premise but ultimately very dull. Kinds of Kindness is not just dull but completely boring with no real intrigue.

The movie is divided into three separate stories, all revolving around the initials 'R.M.F', which are used by many of the cast playing multiple characters. This narrative structure, intended to interweave various tales of absurd kindness and humanity, fails to deliver a cohesive or engaging storyline. The disjointed nature of these stories makes it difficult to form any emotional connection or investment in the characters' journeys.

Although I found all of the characters in this film just as boring as the movie overall, the ensemble cast does their best to bring distinctiveness to their roles. Each character played by the talented actors has their own nuances, highlighting their skill despite the weak material.

The biggest credit goes to the location scouts and art departments for providing beautiful scenery to an otherwise mundane movie. The visual composition of the film is stunning, with carefully chosen settings that enhance the aesthetic appeal.

I did return to finish the film a couple of days later so I could properly review it. Unfortunately, this did not change my initial impression. The film remained an exercise in tedium, with no scenes or moments that redeemed its slow pace and uninspired plot. Even the most beautifully shot scenes couldn’t hold my interest for long. The disjointed narrative and the lack of engaging content made it a struggle to sit through the entire film.",2024-07-09T15:07:16.689Z,1029955,2 stars,0.7108321785926819
r96sk,9.0,"Quite the thing! I really enjoyed <em>'Kinds of Kindness'</em>.

I'm also someone who loved <em>'Poor Things'</em> from these folk, so I guess me also liking this isn't any sort of surprise. It is a truly bizarre movie and I can see many disliking it, a thought supported by the fact that in a cinema with around 10 others alongside me, 3 left before the conclusion; 1 left at the end of chapter one, then a group of 2 left at the end of chapter two.

I'm personally absolutely cool with absurdity if the filmmakers truly commit to it, otherwise what's the point? Yorgos Lanthimos & Co. evidently did just that and I was thoroughly entertained across the entire run time, which is impressive given it lasts for almost three hours; it flew by for me.

I'm already a big fan of those onscreen so didn't need much convincing to see them act again, and I'm glad I did because all those acting here are great. Jesse Plemons is the standout in my eyes, what a terrific showing from that man - such a top actor! Emma Stone is, obviously, excellent as well, as is the awesome Willem Dafoe. Margaret Qualley, Hong Chau and Mamoudou Athie merit praise too.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,7.0,"“I mostly loved it, but I kinda hated it” has pretty much become my mantra with the filmography of Yorgos Lanthimos, a writer/director whom most moviegoers will either loathe or adore. There are those of us who are firm fence sitters with his tales of absurdism and cruelty (although I skew towards the yay! versus the nay!), and it’s honestly a toss-up whether or not you’ll enjoy his latest bizarro project, “Kinds of Kindness.”

Written as a triptych fable that weaves together three distinct narratives, the film has layers upon layers of hefty, rich themes that are as thought-provoking as they are (at least on the surface) head-scratching. The first is a story of a man who has no choice in his life path, but is finally trying to stand up and take control of the direction his existence has been heading. The second is a totally weird tale of a policeman whose wife has gone missing at sea, but he becomes convinced that a doppelganger of her has returned home, where he delights in torturing her mercilessly. The final story is about a spiritual cult member who is determined to find a mysterious woman with a special ability who can lead the group to their destiny. It’s better to go in knowing as little as possible about the narrative, because the memorable surprises and general “WTF?” moments are also the film’s most successful.

As is the case with most of his former projects, Lanthimos once again gravitates towards the surreal, with unsettling stories that explore themes like fate, identity, free will, authority, power dynamics, and the complexities of human connection. It’s macabre and funny; dramatic and disturbing. The contemporary stories interconnect with a subtlety that’s incredibly well done through shared themes and recurring motifs, and the film blurs the line between dreamlike fantasy and harsh reality.

Further connecting the three stories together and keeping with coherent themes, Lanthimos keeps his cast small, utilizing the same actors (including Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, Willem Dafoe, Mamoudou Athie, Margaret Qualley, and Hong Chau) in different roles in each of the fables. Very few directors working today can consistently draw out exceptional performances from their actors, but Lanthimos is one of the true greats. Everyone is top-of-their-game terrific, with a jaw-dropping, standout turn from the limitlessly versatile (and immensely talented) Plemons.

Obviously, “Kinds of Kindness” isn’t a film that will appeal to everyone. With its existential musings, experimental narratives, abstract storytelling, and deliberate pacing, Lanthimos certainly does not cater to mainstream tastes. But the small segment of movie lovers at which this visionary project is aimed will be up to the challenge (and of course, absolutely delighted).

tmdb51616167,3.0,"The movie ""Kinds of Kindness"" was a perplexing and convoluted film that left me scratching my head. Clocking in at over three hours, it has earned the reputation of being the ultimate headache-inducing movie due to its scattered narrative.

Initially, the film showed promise with its stellar casting and intriguing storyline. I found myself drawn into the characters and their interactions, particularly with the protagonist's boss. However, as the plot unfolded, it spiraled deeper and deeper into confusion, leaving me feeling exhausted and questioning how much more I could bear.

Honestly, I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this film. It won't clean your house like a vacuum, that's for sure. It's the kind of movie that makes you say, ""No thanks, I'll pass."" Unfortunately, that's all I can really say about it. The only standout aspect was Emma Stone's portrayal of a sexually driven character, which left me wondering about her choice of roles. Perhaps she's chasing an Oscar by taking on such provocative characters, but it left me more puzzled than impressed.",2024-09-02T02:52:31.152Z,1029955,2 stars,0.656215250492096
moviepoptime,-1.0,"Kinds of Kindness is a thought-provoking film that explores themes of affection, toxic love, and the complexities of human relationships. Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, the film presents three interconnected stories that delve into the darker sides of kindness and cruelty.

My experience with the movie was a mix of fascination and discomfort. The cinematography is striking, capturing both beauty and bleakness, which enhances the storytelling. While some moments are deeply unsettling—featuring elements like cannibalism and self-mutilation—the film's exploration of abuse and its impact is handled with a level of depth that kept me engaged.

The writing is sharp, filled with dark humor that contrasts with the serious themes, making it an intriguing watch despite its almost three-hour runtime. However, I found that the film's forced weirdness sometimes detracted from its emotional core.

Overall, Kinds of Kindness is a unique cinematic experience that challenges viewers to reflect on the nature of kindness itself. It's not for everyone, but those who appreciate unconventional storytelling may find it rewarding.

The film's action sequences are brutal, exciting, and innovative, featuring engaging set pieces and characters. Despite a somewhat thin premise, the action remains a standout. #ChrisHemsworth delivers a compelling performance, his intimidating presence suggesting potential for a spin-off origin film for his character. #AnyaTaylorJoy is commendable, bringing sufficient depth to her role. However, the subplot exploring Furiosa's origins feels weak and underdeveloped. Overall, Furiosa serves as a worthy prequel with unparalleled action choreography, although the climax may feel off and stretched, potentially disappointing fans expecting a stronger ending.\r\n\r\nWatch or Not?\r\nIf you liked Mad Max Fury Road, then go for this, action lovers go for this.

""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga deepens its titular protagonist and the respective post-apocalyptic world, offering a captivating origin story that enriches Fury Road, but its excessive runtime, predictability, and time spent addressing the other installment's flaws hinder its enjoyment.

The action set pieces lack the same novelty factor and frenetic pace, but the stunts remain impressive. The performances of Anya Taylor-Joy and Alyla Browne as Furiosa deserve praise, as does Chris Hemsworth's insane portrayal of Dementus.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"The young ""Furiosa"" (Alyla Browne) is captured by some rogue bikers and despite the best efforts of her sharp-shooting mother is help captive by the menacing ""Dementus"" (Chris Hemsworth) who rather paternally calls her ""Little D""! This dystopian world really consists of three powers. The ""Immortan Joe"" (Lachy Hulme) in an unassailable citadel where food and water are plentiful, the ""Guardian of Gastown"" (Peter Stephens) who runs the last refinery producing petrol and the ""Bullet Farm"" - a quarry. They have a loose bartering arrangement that allows each to hold their own territory and this is arrangement ""Dementus"" and his army of thousands wants to take control of. He does manage to secure a better deal with ""Joe"" but only if he trades his ""Little D"" as part of the bargain. Once she's been duly swapped and introduced to his harem, she determines that she needs a new ID! Years go by as she passes for a boy, moves up the food chain at the Citadel and is finally sent on war-rig duties trading gas for food. It's now that she (Anya Taylor-Joy) encounters the war-rig driver ""Praeteorian Jack"" (Tom Burke) and, thinking he might be a conduit for her to get back home, joins forces for some battles royal. As origin stories go, this is good end to end stuff, quickly paced and packed with action right from the beginning. Hemsworth is highly entertaining as the prose-spouting monster and there are loads of supporting characters - the likes of ""Smeg"", ""Rictus Erectus"" and ""Scrotus"" to characterise these gangs of violent and ruthless half-wits. ATJ doesn't really have that much to do for most of this, and has virtually no dialogue - but when she is on screen she works well with her ninja skills coming to the fore. I didn't love the ending, it drags a bit and is entirely predictable, but this holds up well for 2½ hours and the stunt work and live-action photography is impressive.",2024-05-28T07:37:14.296Z,786892,4 stars,0.6665611267089844
MovieGuys,6.0,"Whilst Furiosa isn't a bad action film, I suspect its lacklustre response from audiences, reflects not whats on offer but whats absent. 

On the upside is loads of heart stopping action, amazing cinematic's, great sets, plus strong performances from the cast.

A lesser aspect of the downside is the unnecessarily drawn out back story, replete with details about the key character, no one cares about, which, in turn, leads to the main fault in this film.......ITS NOT ABOUT MAD MAX Rockatansky.

Lets be honest, no one's really interested in peripheral characters or their back story, they want the REAL DEAL. That's where this film was always going to fall flat with viewing audiences.

If this film had been about Mad Max with a back story covering as yet unrevealed aspects of the life of  the younger and older Max, in the latter case played by the actor who made the franchise famous, Mel Gibson, then I suspect Hollywood would have a real HIT on their hands. 

In summary, you don't make a major film about the back story of a peripheral character from a franchise, you make the film about the MAIN character, its as simple as that. I'm amazed this wasn't obvious.",2024-05-30T04:24:18.329Z,786892,3 stars,0.5214767456054688
r96sk,8.0,"I enjoyed <em>'Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga'</em>, which is a rightful addition to the <em>'Mad Max'</em> franchise.

I personally would say that the run time is way too long, like this does not need to be a 2hr 20min+ movie. With that said, I still got the desired amount of entertainment from this 2024 flick. Chris Hemsworth is outstanding, easily the most I've wanted to see a character onscreen from this series; he fits the role perfectly.

Anya Taylor-Joy puts in a very good showing as well, her character doesn't say much so a lot of the performance is reliant on her visual emotions - which Taylor-Joy portrays on point. The rest of the cast are on the same level to me, all support the show well without rising near the lead two; similar-ish story for the whole franchise, in truth.

Visually the movie looks cracking, while the action matches prior installments in providing the vast majority of what makes these films so worth the watch. This prequel/spin-off is one I'd put in the top bracket from this series, it's up there with <em>'Mad Max: Fury Road'</em> - which does just slightly edge ahead.",2024-05-31T19:26:28.996Z,786892,4 stars,0.6953126192092896
JP Hastings-Spital,-1.0,"I really enjoyed this film! It is _a lot_ of explosions and brutality, but it was continually compelling — even as I questioned why I was so invested. At 2h20m it definitely made me feel my sleepy age (I saw it on my 39th birthday, and I was squinting and yawning by the end!) but I felt more impressed that a relatively slow paced film gripped me for so long.

It's a proper odyssey, with poor Furiosa only wanting to get home; but the trials she faces grow organically out of the plot and the universe, and give Furiosa a depth I didn't expect from a character/actor who's almost entirely expressionless through the film.

This entry in the Mad Max continuum (though I've only watched [the first](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/9659-mad-max), and [Fury Road](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/76341-mad-max-fury-road)) steers away from exploring the whats and whys of the apocalyptic world they live in, tempting though I'm sure it was in a 2024 that has _so many_ parallels, and instead lets us draw our own conclusions. The men in power who lie and rabble-rouse to get the power they desire, just so they can watch the world burn (again); how much we all embrace making ourselves vulnerable for the hope of human connection; the power dynamics and game theory in a world where two thirds of what you need is only necessary because of collective attitudes.

I'm certain I'll watch this again—and as a stand-alone film—which, for a long and relatively simple plot, is something very uncommon for me. I hope you enjoy it too!

TheSceneSnobs,5.0,"This installment of the Mad Max saga was disappointing. Personally, I would have preferred a continuation of Furiosa's story with Charlize Theron rather than an origin story. However, once Anya Taylor-Joy was cast, my excitement returned. Her performance in The Menu is one of my favorites, and she has never given a bad performance. Despite my anticipation, I walked out of this movie feeling underwhelmed.

The film feels a bit detached from the franchise. Returning to an origin story, especially in this series, feels like a misstep. The strength of the first four movies lies in their forward momentum and the development of their characters. We've already seen the beginning in Mad Max; what the audience craves is progress, ideally with Max at the forefront but I would like to see 'Furiosa' along for future rides.

While the cinematography is undeniably gorgeous, the editing leaves much to be desired. The film spends too much time on areas that don't align with what makes a Mad Max film great. For example, the original films excelled in their high-octane action sequences and tight pacing, whereas this installment meanders, losing the kinetic energy that defines the series and limits an entire war to a montage.

Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of Dementus is a mixed bag. He brings a certain fun to the role, but his character often feels frustratingly inconsistent. There are moments where Dementus' choices seem out of character or simply don’t make sense, disrupting the narrative flow and diminishing the overall impact of the film. Some could argue that his demented nature is the reason for his decisions but even that idea falls flat.

One of the most disappointing aspects is that this movie lacks the fun, rewatchable quality of its predecessors. The previous films in the series are known for their relentless pace and compelling characters, making them enjoyable to revisit. This installment, however, doesn’t capture that same magic, leaving it feeling somewhat deflated in comparison.

While 'Furiosa' offers some stunning visals and strong performances, it ultimately fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessors. The decision to focus on an origin story rather than continuing Furiosa's journey feels like a missed opportunity. Fans of the franchise may find some enjoyment in the film, but it doesn’t possess the same exhilarating spirit that made the earlier movies iconic.

Moving forward, it would be more satisfying to see the series return to its roots, focusing on character-driven narratives that push the story forward. A continuation of Furiosa’s journey or a new chapter with Max would likely resonate more with audiences, capturing the essence of what makes Mad Max an enduring and beloved franchise.",2024-07-09T14:26:32.478Z,786892,2 stars,0.6967509388923645

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,5.0,"There’s no doubt that “Furiosa” is a strong, entertaining, and high quality film, but director George Miller‘s latest installment in the Mad Max franchise falls short in delivering the same fresh and original experience as “Fury Road.” Miller builds on the legacy of the 2015 Oscar-winning hit, but the film still struggles with a repetitive narrative (and a tired retread of visuals) that fails to capture the groundbreaking innovations that made its predecessor such a worldwide phenomenon. I liked this movie a lot, but I certainly didn’t love it.

As the world collapses, young Furiosa (Alyla Browne) is forcibly taken from the Green Place of Many Mothers and captured by a formidable Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth). As they traverse the Wasteland, they encounter the Citadel, ruled by Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme). Amidst the power struggle between these two tyrants, Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy) must endure numerous trials to gather the resources needed to find her way back home.

The film tells the origin story of the renegade warrior (and certified badass) Furiosa before her encounter with Mad Max. It’s a prequel to “Fury Road,” and this movie builds a satisfying history to the unlikely female hero. The first half of the story is the most compelling, as the narrative traces Furiosa’s journey from a young girl held captive in a brutal world to her development into a fierce combatant. The first part of her history is also filled with the most emotional depth, outlining the motivations of her character and the harsh realities that shaped her. It adds layers of complexity to the character, which is why I found this part of the movie to be the most engaging.

The second half began to wear me down as it falls into a repetitive cycle of desert chases and action scenes that feel all too familiar. While they’re executed with Miller’s signature flair, they seem lacking in innovation. The whole “been there, done that” vibe really puts a damper on things. I think part of the problem here is that “Fury Road” set such a high bar with its inventive visual style and storytelling, and a lot of that is replicated (flaming fireballs, armored trucks, vast expanses of golden deserts…even some of the exact same stunts are in play). This makes the film too predictable and slightly disappointing, especially when that element of surprise and eye-popping awe has come to define the franchise. The action is a blast and the post-apocalyptic setting and costumes are exceptional, but the envelope isn’t quite pushed as far as it could’ve been.

The brightest spot is, without question, Simon Duggan‘s cinematography. This is a gorgeous looking movie from beginning to end, and the visuals capture the brutality as well as the stark beauty of the wasteland. The special effects are also flawless, but all of these technical achievements (and strong performances from the cast) can’t quite compensate for the weaker elements — although I would venture to guess that diehard fans aren’t going to care.

“Furiosa” is a worthy addition to the Mad Max saga, even if it doesn’t reach the creative heights nor deliver the groundbreaking experience that delighted all of us with “Fury Road.”

JPV852,6.0,"Some decent action sequences as expected though, from my memory, doesn't come close to the epic chaos from Fury Road. The acting for the most part was fine and Chris Hemsworth seemed to be having some fun in his villain role while Anya Taylor-Joy was fine as Furiosa. However, having this coming out 9 years after Fury Road and a spin-off of a character that frankly I had little interest in, was the downfall of this prequel. Beyond that, the plot itself wasn't enthralling and at times I was pretty bored.

I wish we got an actual Mad Max: Fury Road sequel with Tom Hardy; why they went this route is puzzling, but not to mention taking so long to get it out. It's not too surprising this bombed at the box office and was the death nail of the franchise. **2.75/5**",2024-08-10T05:13:13.606Z,786892,3 stars,0.4647195637226105
Mangoturtle,8.0,"George Miller definitely had it him to make it epic.

I hadn't seen Fury Road since it came out, so I took the liberty to watch it and finish it an hour before I went to go see Furiosa, and personally, I liked Furiosa more. 

The antagonist felt a lot more connected to the plot and the world building was better, you were able to get more of a scope of the world. 

Anya Taylor-Joy is one of my favorite actresses, everything she's in is good and this is no exception. 

The cinematography of this movie was also more creative.

The only drawback for me was that the vehicle designs did not seem as special as Fury Road's. They just seemed like the basic motorcycles and 18 wheelers, which isn't that bad, it's just a little sad.

Overall a great watch, better than any of the fast and furious movies for sure.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,9.0,"I do not know if I expected another woke Hollywood turd and therefore was really positively surprised or if the movie is just really good but, to me, this is a really good movie.

I had heard rumblings about it being bad but, again too me, that is just not true. It is also claimed that it didn’t do as well as expected at the box office but then this is oftentimes clueless Hollywood bean counters with unrealistic and overinflated expectations causing this.

This is the kind of action filled, crazy and fairly violent movie that you would expect from a Mad Max movie.

The action is good, the characters are good, the settings are good (the Bullet Farm was mostly a whole in the ground and a bit underwhelming though), and the story is actually not bad at all.

Also, there is no woke, far left preaching that I could notice in the movie which in todays world is a great plus.

Overall I really liked the movie and its two and a half hour run length did not really feel too long.

If I should complain about something it would be that they just skipped over the war between Dementus and Immortan Joe with some bla bla about humans always having fought wars.

The movie also felt a bit “sanitized”, that is lacking grittiness and gore, for being a Mad Max movie. The R rating that it apparently got in the US is pretty ridiculous. In France it got a 13+ rating.

kevin2019,6.0,"""Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga"" is enjoyable enough and George Miller is an amazing director, but the film is overlong and it does have a tendency to meander too much of the time. It is basically nothing more than a high octane succession of action scenes at its core, but don't get yourself too excited by the prospect of this. The scenes in question lack the raw excitement of the original trilogy and this is principally because most of the action is obviously taking place in the comfortable security of the studio. This is disappointing, especially when compared to the downright reckless derring-do of the original films where the absolutely superb stunt teams risked life and limb in pursuit of the imaginative and timeless sequences they captured on film for our enjoyment back in the hazardous days where health and safety precautions barely existed at all whereas today the most serious injury you are apt to receive is when your harness suddenly goes a little crazy and bounces you off the nearest green screen.",2024-12-28T02:52:32.420Z,786892,3 stars,0.659490704536438

Here, he's a rather geeky teacher (Gary) who teaches philosophy at a college whilst occasionally helping out the cops with some criminal profiling. When one of their investigators ""Jasper"" (Austin Amelio) goes a bit too far and gets suspended, Gary gets drafted in last minute and proves quite effective at getting folks who want to bump of their nearest and dearest for $5,000 to admit their cunning plans to a well wired-up con.

When her husband is found dead, he thinks he knows exactly who did what and how best to exact his revenge...

r96sk,9.0,"<em>'Hit Man'</em> is fun!

Glen Powell and Adria Arjona team up to form a strong acting chemistry, I enjoyed seeing them both feature all the way through - two great performances. On the note of the cast, good to see Austin Amelio appear; I like that guy from his <em>'The Walking Dead'</em> days.

This movie is paced very well, the two hour run time did not feel of that length at all. It holds an interesting and fairly amusing plot, one brought to life by everyone involved on and off screen very nicely. It's goofy in certain ways, though that is only a positive to be honest. I also thought it was going to end slightly differently, but again that's not a negative.",2024-06-08T11:26:23.064Z,974635,4 stars,0.7384763360023499

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,3.0,"Richard Linklater‘s “Hit Man” is a film with a serious identity crisis. This genre blending disaster starts out as a wannabe goofy comedy, then veers off the rails into dark noir, finally settling on a bizarrely erotic femme-fatale rom-com. This movie is absolutely terrible, and its only saving grace is its lead’s bonafide Hollywood star power.

Straight-laced professor Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) has an odd hobby: he moonlights with the New Orleans Police Department as a fake hit man. With a penchant for inhabiting different personalities and donning outrageous costumes, Gary has a knack for telling potential clients (and marks) just the right things to get them arrested. Things get complicated when he falls for Madison (Adria Arjona), a potential criminal who meets with Gary to discuss hiring him to murder her awful husband. The two start a romantic relationship in a sea of deception and moral ambiguity, which changes Gary’s life forever.

It’s a great premise for a film, but Linklater just can’t make it work. While he admittedly isn’t one of my favorite directors, he completely misses the mark here. The narrative is disjointed and the tonal inconsistencies are too jarring, and no amount of talent can balance the uneven, overstuffed elements of comedy, romance, and thriller. The film struggles on just about every level, but thankfully Powell saves it from being completely unwatchable.

Powell is the highlight here. His charm and versatility shines as he navigates the complex layers of his character. This is an actor who is a true chameleon, and the film at least provides a vehicle where he can showcase his range. Powell is great; the movie is not.

Linklater introduces a lot of bland melodrama with the relationship between Gary and Madison and, despite a believable chemistry, it causes the film to stumble even more. With her character’s motivations being murky at best, it was impossible to feel fully invested in Madison’s relationship with Gary’s alter-ego, Ron.

For a film that had the potential to be so unique, it ends up feeling generic and unsatisfying. Despite having a small theatrical release, “Hit Man” is a disappointing effort that appropriately feels right at home as a streaming title on Netflix.

RalphRahal,7.0,"Hit Man by Richard Linklater is a solid watch, blending a deliberate pace with engaging character work. The first act feels like it lingers a little too long, but by the time the final act rolls around, you realize it was all intentional. That slower setup creates a nice payoff later, making the transitions between acts smooth and well-timed. It’s clear Linklater knew exactly how much breathing room to give the story, even if it left me wishing for a bit more energy upfront.

Glen Powell and Adria Arjona carry the film with their performances, delivering exactly what their roles demand without overdoing it. Their character arcs extend nicely into the second act, which keeps things interesting and makes you care about what happens next. The plot itself isn’t groundbreaking and leans on some predictability, but it seems like Linklater aimed to keep things simple, possibly to avoid overwhelming the audience. Still, a touch more depth in the story wouldn’t have hurt.

Visually and musically, the film doesn’t go above and beyond, but it also doesn’t drop the ball. The cinematography and score do their job without overshadowing the narrative. Overall, Hit Man may not wow you on every front, but it’s an enjoyable and well-crafted movie that knows its strengths and sticks to them. It’s the kind of film where the characters and pacing shine more than the visuals or complexity, making it a worthwhile experience.",2025-01-05T22:01:46.268Z,974635,4 stars,0.8279842138290405
CinemaSerf,6.0,"The heavy trailing of this and the fact that it's part one does little to help any sense of menace as we follow the young ""Maya"" (Madelaine Petsch) and boyfriend ""Ryan"" (Froy Gutierrez) on their road trip to Portland. She's heading to start a new job as an architect, and it looks like she might have been responsible for manscaping her boyfriend's perfect visage as this annoyingly loved up and clingy couple arrive at a remote rural diner. They're not married, which seems to rile the locals and when they go to leave, their brand new car won't start. Ha! Luckily, there's an air b'n'b nearby. A remote cabin fully equipped with all the home comforts - even some Dolly to play on vinyl. They're famished so he borrows a motor bike to go fetch some burgers, she's left behind and that's where the paranoia sets in. Is she being watched? Is she alone? Will ""Ryan"" get back before she has finished smoking a dodgy joint, listening to an entire LP and having a long shower? Was the burger joint in California? Anyway, it's soon clear that they are in some danger and together they must use all their skill and guile to stay alive! The scenario works a bit like ""Cabin in the Woods"". The moonlit forest serving as a backdrop for some ridiculous choices and some woefully bad acting/writing. It does manage to engender a slight degree of peril near the conclusion, but there's really nothing at all new here and from fairly early on it is clear just what part two will be all about.

r96sk,5.0,"<em>'The Strangers: Chapter 1'</em> is a let-down.

It sets the scene well with some tension and is held together by a strong score, visually in terms of cinematography and literally in the case of the masks it is fairly effective too but the film doesn't really do enough - with those aforementioned positives and just in general. It starts onscreen by describing forthcoming events as ""brutal"", yet by the end I don't really feel like I saw anything all that noteworthy; just your standard horror fare, at best, really.

Madelaine Petsch and Froy Gutierrez are good in the lead roles I will say, though some of their character decisions (as is typical with this genre, I guess) are frustratingly dumb; I'm looking at you in particular, Gutierrez's Ryan. Some of their dialogue isn't much better, either. All in all, I'm disappointed as this could've been real great. Instead, we're left with something that I'd personally class as poor, unfortunately.

Chapters 2 + 3 might improve things, let's hope so, but I wouldn't be surprised if this basically just gets rehashed in those next installments, let's hope not in that case.

TheSceneSnobs,1.0,"This reimagining of the far superior original was an abysmal disappointment. While attempting to build a trilogy or franchise, it's crucial to ensure that each movie can stand on its own. Unfortunately, this film fails to achieve that, presenting a boring three-act structure where nothing significant happens.

The film's suspense is nonexistent, failing to create any sense of tension or atmosphere. A suspenseful movie should keep viewers on the edge of their seats, but this one falls flat. 

The characters are mostly unlikable, making it hard to invest in their fates. In a horror film, it's essential to have characters that the audience can either root for or fear for. Here, the protagonists' lack of depth and development leaves viewers indifferent. For example, there's a scene where the main character faces a crucial decision, but due to poor character development, the moment lacks emotional weight and impact.

I recall an experience at Universal's Halloween Horror Nights Terror Tram ride in Hollywood, where we were led through the mountains all the way to the Bates Motel. During this trek, I encountered a Haunter dressed as the 'Sackhead Man' from the original movie. This character exuded an eerie presence that was genuinely unsettling. In contrast, the 'Sackhead Man' or ""Scarecrow"" as credited in this film, doesn’t even make the top three performances of 'Sackhead' that I have encountered. This portrayal lacks the menace and charisma needed to make a lasting impression.

Overall, this reimagining fails to capture the essence of the original. It lacks suspense, atmosphere, and compelling characters, resulting in a tedious and forgettable experience. For a film to succeed in revitalizing a classic, it must honor the original's strengths while introducing fresh and engaging elements. Sadly, this movie does neither, leaving fans yearning for the original's superior storytelling and tension.",2024-07-09T15:13:41.794Z,1010600,2 stars,0.684165894985199
kevin2019,5.0,"""The Strangers: Chapter One"" is completely devoid of everything that made ""The Strangers"" (2008) such a compelling and menacing motion picture. The strangers of the title are immediately at a disadvantage this time around because they obviously no longer have the element of surprise on their side. We have seen it all before as they silently move through the shadows while observing their unsuspecting prey before finally attacking them without mercy or remorse. The jump scares are all tepid and ruined by well signposted and unimaginative camera angles and it is unfortunate the stabbings at the end are actually shown and no longer suggested (the human imagination is one of the most subtly powerful allies at a director's disposal during such moments). However, it is somewhat surprising this film isn't a good deal more tiresome and monotonous, but having said that it also never manages to rise above being an average and overly familiar waste of time which boasts only a few insignificent and uninspiring changes to the formula used in the first film.",2025-01-02T01:26:09.703Z,1010600,2 stars,0.6746717691421509

""Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is an intriguing addition to the franchise, full of fascinating parallels and a thought-provoking exploration of Caesar’s legacy, despite some lack of depth linked to the motivations of some characters.

The exploration of important themes such as religion, war, and distinct perspectives on biblical figures leads to the most immersive moments of a film that takes time to find its rhythm. With a clear vision from Wes Ball and fantastic performances, the impressive motion-capture work contributes tremendously to a visually mesmerizing experience.

For fans of the saga, it’s a continuation worth following with interest, promising more moral reflections on the evolution of nature and the inevitable cycle of life.""

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Quick question. So it was a virus that led to the role reversal between the speaking humans and their ape counterparts? Now the apes have the upper hand and humanity is back in the caves. What I don't really get is why everything is in ruins and why there's an escalator in the middle of a forest full of zebras? Speech is crucial for communication, granted, but as the apes now thrive amidst the ruins of human construction I couldn't quite figure out why it was all decimated in the first place. Was there a war? Did I miss it? Anyway, Simian society still claims derivation from ""Caesar"" and in typical human fashion is just as divided. The apes live a peaceful life stealing the eagle's eggs from precariously perched nests so they can rear them themselves - and the eagles don't really seem to mind. The militaristic gorillas raid their village and drag them all to the seaside resort of ""Proximus"" where he is trying to break into an human, subterranean, vault. The raid caused havoc amongst the peaceable apes and left only ""Noa"" to try to free them. En route, he encounters ""Mae"" (Freya Allan) - an human who can speak, and upon arrival she befriends another talking person ""Trevathan"" (William H. Macy) who are both expected to help reach the treasures of the vault. She knows what's in there, and with the help of her new friends hopes to salvage what she was sent to retrieve - but without allowing any weapons inside to fall into enemy hands. It takes far too long to get going, this, but once we've established who is who and the story has kicked in, it's quite an exciting tale with some great visuals effects and just a little philosophy to keep it from falling into a trap of franchise mundanity. The acting isn't really up to much, but an enthusiastic effort from Kevin Durand as the menacing leader and some authentic looking acrobatics not seen since Johnny Weissmuller make for an entertaining episode in what is clearly a soap-style plot development where this is but an episode in a what happens next scenario.",2024-05-11T09:59:43.930Z,653346,3 stars,0.5067006945610046
r96sk,6.0,"Has its moments, though overall I kinda found <em>'Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes'</em> a bit of a slog to sit through.

The original trilogy are films that I do enjoy, they're very good. This fourth installment, however, underwhelmed me throughout its 145 minute run time. It starts off a new plot, obviously given how <em>'War for the Planet of the Apes'</em> concluded, and the new characters and their stories didn't really interest me.

Some of the action is watchable, the military bunker angle is decent, the visual effects are strong (but we already knew that) and the bits directly with Noa and Raka are the film's best in my opinion. I don't, though, really recall much else about this and remember feeling quite nonplussed whilst watching; the literal final music-filled shot got me pumped though, out of nowhere. None of the cast (voice or otherwise) stand out, either.

I'd have finished this franchise with the 2017 flick, but very much sounds like the filmmakers are planning another trilogy with this one. Hopefully I'll enjoy those (and the inevitable 2030s 'new' trilogy... 😏) more.",2024-05-17T19:55:53.723Z,653346,3 stars,0.7524768114089966

The CGI is now good enough for what is probably our first really in-depth look at the ape civilization following the fall of man.

Sure, it doesn't have as grandiose a story as Caesar's but it does a grand job of world building and showing us how the ape society of the distant future is functioning. The exploration of the mythology which has built up with regards to their past and Caesar's time is also interesting.

Proximus isn't even really a villain as such, which makes him and his vision for the future a nice counter to the uncertain goals of Noa's human companion.

Particularly enjoyed the ending, which, when you realise it is coming, you have to laugh as it has been set up throughout the movie.

And the little kicker was good too. Setting us up nicely for a sequel which may see this reboot series veer back towards it's origins.

Kingdom (as I'll refer to it) is entertaining but it really does little, in this reviewers estimation, to move the franchise forward in a meaningful way. Its story is rather formulaic and you do quickly feel like you have ""seen it all before"", in one form or another. 

Having said this, I do not think Kingdom is a bad film. That would be unfair. Its CGI is top notch, as I said its story is basic but it does work, with well paced, varied action. Commendably, they even managed a little human/ape interest, which lifts the characters beyond being mere, cardboard cut outs.  

In summary, entertaining, watchable but really as far as I can see, nothing new is on offer here, either.

TheSceneSnobs,7.0,"The Planet of the Apes prequel films have been nothing short of astonishing, and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes continues this trend with remarkable filmmaking. The decision to set this installment 300 years after the previous films, yet still focus on Caesar's legacy, was a brilliant move. It effectively addresses the absence of Andy Serkis and Caesar by weaving his influence throughout the narrative.

Our protagonist Noah and his clan emerge as standout characters, bringing new life to the series. Their dynamic and struggles are compelling, adding depth to the narrative. Proximus Caesar serves as an effective villain, embodying the darker aspects of Caesar's legacy. His complex motivations and ruthless tactics provide a formidable challenge for Noah and his allies. 

My biggest gripe with the film lies in the portrayal of the human element. There is a lack of clarity regarding humanity's current state within this franchise. More understanding or explanation of humanity's status would have enriched the story. For instance, scenes involving humans operating missile silos 300 years after their construction strain credibility without sufficient backstory. A deeper exploration of how humanity has adapted or regressed over the centuries would have added valuable context.

Despite this flaw, the overall filmmaking remains top-notch. The visuals are stunning, with meticulous attention to detail in both the ape civilization and the post-apocalyptic landscapes. The special effects, particularly the motion capture work, are exceptional, bringing the apes to life with astonishing realism. 

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is a fantastic addition to the series, successfully balancing new elements with the rich legacy of Caesar. While the human storyline could benefit from greater depth and clarity, the film excels in its primary focus on the apes and their evolving society. This installment delivers a satisfying conclusion to the saga, and I would be content if the series ended here, preserving the integrity of Caesar's legacy and the high standards set by these prequels.",2024-07-09T14:32:02.605Z,653346,4 stars,0.7389203310012817

An ""If"" is the imaginary friend a child has when they are young. It is a comfort and a companion to get them through the growing up years. But where does the imaginary friend go when it is used up. Apparently, the word ""imaginary"" needs to be changed.

The film, written and directed by Krasinski, aims to be kind of like a live action ""Monsters, Inc"". It's really an idea that can only work in animation since it takes out that sense of reality that makes it look too silly. The plot just seems like an idea that has difficulty finding a believable footing.

TheSceneSnobs,2.0,"IF promised an intriguing premise but unfortunately fell short of delivering a compelling narrative. The film heavily relies on celebrity cameos, which, overshadow the story's substance. This overreliance on star power creates a superficial experience that fails to engage the audience meaningfully.

The movie attempts to pull on the heartstrings of the audience, but it does so without a satisfying payoff. Emotional scenes feel forced and unearned, lacking the depth necessary to make a lasting impact. 

The narrative structure is weak. The pacing is uneven, jumping from one celebrity cameo to another without allowing the plot to develop naturally. This results in a fragmented viewing experience that leaves the audience struggling to connect with the characters. 

The film's attempt to evoke emotion through its storyline falls flat because it doesn’t give enough attention to character development. We see glimpses of potentially interesting backstories, but they are never fully explored. A scene involving a character’s past trauma is introduced but quickly abandoned, leaving the audience with unanswered questions and a sense of incompleteness.

Overall, IF is a movie that misses the mark. Its reliance on celebrity cameos and superficial emotional appeals results in a lackluster film. To improve, the filmmakers should have focused more on developing a strong, cohesive narrative that allows the characters' stories to resonate deeply with the audience.

oswaldovzki,7.0,"As a fan of John Krasinski, I was really looking forward to watching ""IF,"" but I have to admit, it left me a bit disappointed. Not because it’s a bad movie but because I went in with expectations that weren’t quite met.

""IF"" is a solid, well-made film with some great ideas, but it doesn’t fully explore the potential it sets up. It’s clearly aimed at a younger audience, which is fine, but the simplicity of the plot and the way certain moments are handled left me wanting more depth. There are scenes in which the movie tries to make feel urgent but falls flat and doesn’t carry the weight it should. They felt rushed, and that’s a feeling I had throughout much of the movie.

The film has a charming fantasy element that could have been expanded to create something truly magical, but instead, it skims the surface. The pacing is quick, and while that might work for kids, I was hoping for a bit more exploration and development of the ideas presented.

The acting, however, is a bright spot. The cast does a great job with their roles, bringing humor and warmth to the film. Steve Carell as Blue was especially a standout, delivering a performance that was both funny and heartfelt. I just wish we had more of John Krasinski himself, as his presence always adds something special.

I guess I am not the core target audience, it feels more aimed at kids/families despite the moral, though I still didn't really sense much to speak positively about with this one.

I will say that it does set the tone early on nicely (up until the introduction of Blossom & Co.) and concludes with some heart, though everything in-between is underwhelming. The voice cast includes Phoebe Waller-Bridge (who voices the aforementioned) and a fair few other known names, though only Steve Carell (minorly) stood out to me to be honest.

Cailey Fleming does well in the lead role, I already admire her acting due to her time on 'The Walking Dead' - I wish we got more of her as Judith, in fact. Ryan Reynolds - someone I tend to enjoy - feels miscast, I'm all for seeing him play against type but it's just that his character doesn't really do enough to warrant having that sorta actor.

Brent Marchant,2.0,"After watching this piece of incoherent, unfocused rubbish, I would have much rather watched the TV glow instead. Writer-director Jane Schoenbrun’s incomprehensible smart horror offering is an absolute utter waste of time, not to mention the ticket price. This glacially paced story of two psychologically and emotionally troubled teens, Owen (Ian Forema) and Maddy (Brigitte Lundy-Paine), who bond over a cheesy late night 1990s young adult sci-fi/horror television series called The Pink Opaque struggles mightily to find its way. As Owen grows into an adult (Justice Smith), his cohort vanishes mysteriously when the TV series is abruptly cancelled, leaving him wondering what happened to her until she just as mysteriously reappears years later with a disjointed story that makes no sense from top to bottom. As the film’s narrator, Owen tries earnestly to explain, but his recounting of this experience is equally baffling, especially when he tells why Maddy has come back after her protracted absence. The result is an unintelligible tale that’s far from frightening (even metaphorically speaking) and ends up being a convoluted mix of 1990s teen angst, extended and inexplicably incorporated music videos, an exploration of sexual ambiguity, and a woefully wayward attempt at symbolically addressing issues related to personal disassociation and self-actualization. There are also numerous story elements and images that are included in the narrative that go undeveloped and unexplored. To its credit, the picture features a fine production design, intriguing cinematography, a good measure of campy comic relief (though not nearly enough of it) and a skillfully assembled soundtrack (handily this release’s best attribute). However, when a film’s musical guests receive greater billing than its cast members and the soundtrack ends up being its strongest asset, that doesn’t speak well about the production’s overall quality. To be honest, I get genuinely annoyed (and feel egregiously ripped off) when I leave the theater having screened a picture whose trailer and marketing seem to offer so much promise and end up failing miserably when it comes to delivering the goods, and that’s very much the case with this pretentious, sophomoric cinematic train wreck. Don’t waste your time or money on this one.",2024-05-11T22:52:14.086Z,858017,2 stars,0.5780999064445496
TheSceneSnobs,5.0,"I was disappointed in the flow of the story in 'I Saw The TV Glow'. Despite this, the melancholy feel of the film is beautifully conveyed throughout, enhancing its themes effectively. The visuals are stunning, and the combination of top-tier editing and visual effects elevates the cinematography to an exceptional level.

The film’s melancholic atmosphere is one of its strongest points. This pervasive mood adds depth to the narrative, making the emotional and thematic content more impactful. For example, scenes depicting the isolation and struggles of the characters are visually striking, with a muted color palette and hauntingly beautiful landscapes that mirror their inner turmoil. The layered storytelling warrants another viewing to fully appreciate the intricate details and symbolism woven into the film.

The film also provides a profound look into the LGBTQIA+ community, offering perspectives that encourage empathy and understanding. After watching it, I felt compelled to have an open conversation with my sons about the importance of being able to talk openly about anything, assuring them of our unwavering support. This horror movie effectively portrays the harsh realities that no person should have to endure, making its social commentary both relevant and poignant.

The direction and performances were lackluster. Their portrayals are emotionally charged and authentic, bringing a raw intensity to their characters. 

While Ian Foreman and Brigette Lundy-Paine deliver memorable performances, the supporting cast falls short. Justice Smith’s character, Owen, is particularly underwhelming. His character lacks depth and is only marginally more interesting in scenes with Lundy-Paine. The supporting characters are mostly forgettable, which diminishes the film's overall impact.

The TV show set within the film, The Pink Opaque, and its antagonist, as well as the overall antagonist of the film, are clearly meant to be metaphorical. However, the vague nature of these elements, while potentially serving as a good analogy, ultimately hurts the story by leaving too many questions unanswered. A bit more backstory and clarity would have enriched the narrative and provided a stronger connection to the metaphorical themes.

I Saw The TV Glow is a film with commendable visual and thematic depth but falters in its storytelling execution. The melancholy atmosphere, stunning visuals, and strong lead performances are highlights. The film is worth watching for its social commentary and emotional resonance, but it falls short of being a fully engaging cinematic experience.",2024-07-09T16:49:07.359Z,858017,3 stars,0.5578573942184448

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Told using a verity of storytelling techniques, this is a curious film that certainly has a potent point to make but somehow it just can't get there. It's all about the relationship between two folks on the periphery of society. ""Owen"" (Ian Foreman then Justice Smith) lives with his parents whilst ""Maddy"" (Brigette Lundy-Paine) abides with her indifferent mother. She's a few years older than he, and they initially bond over a television show called ""Pink Opaque"" that she has been watching for a few seasons, but it's on past his 10.15 bedtime. She makes it pretty clear that her sexual interests lie elsewhere but he, not remotely bothered, just wants to see the show. A sleepover starts the ball rolling on their enigmatic friendship that invites us to consider a range of issues surrounding sexual and gender identity, fluidity and the sometimes quite traumatic effects these can have on people emotionally and psychologically ill-equipped to deal with at a young age. The use of the television series is quite an effective conduit for the theme as it uses the super-natural to instil both an element of fear and an element of the ridiculous - especially the ice cream man and the totally non-menacing ""Mr. Malevolent"" whose purposes and dynamic evolve as the characters do throughout the narrative. Suddenly, she goes AWOL for ten years then returns to his life with questions to ask and to answer, but is she still the same person and are either of them any more at ease with whom they truly are? It has brief moments to lighten the mood, but for the most part it's quite an intense and slowly paced look at two characters that I just didn't feel I knew. I suspect this may resonate intensely with people dealing with gender identification complexities, but for the rest of us it pointed us in the right direction but then more or less abandons us to infill too much of the personalities of ""Owen"" and ""Maddy"" to fit our own expectations or aspirations for them. It's as if auteur Jane Schoenbrun has given us the edge of the jigsaw puzzle and left us to do the rest - without there necessarily being a right way to do it. It also has one or two goes at bringing things to a conclusion - or as much of one as we are to actually have, and that didn't really work for me. I didn't need ""the end"", but what we did get was a bit frail. It is an intriguing piece of cinema at times, but for me it lost it's way.",2024-08-13T07:49:00.680Z,858017,3 stars,0.5707362294197083

""The Idea of You can't seem to find enough standout elements to compensate for the lack of narrative innovation, thematic depth, or compelling execution.

Michael Showalter gets lost in the shallowness of the genre's countless formulas, the excessive fluffiness of the dialogues, and the dull clichés that fill a very familiar premise, failing to justify a frustratingly incoherent ending. While Anne Hathaway and Nicholas Galitzine's performances are blameless, the movie leaves much to be desired in terms of emotional impact.

TheSceneSnobs,7.0,"I am not usually drawn to romantic films where a woman changes her life and finds love when she least expects it. These films don't typically resonate with me, but I watched this one for review purposes and found myself really enjoying it. While the plot is simple, it is not without charm, and the acting meets the expectations for this genre, complete with its share of cheesy moments. However, it tells a pleasant story with some worthwhile themes.

The plot may be straightforward, but it is executed well, providing a satisfying narrative arc. The story centers on a woman trying something new and unexpectedly finding love, a familiar trope that is handled with care and sincerity. 

Anne Hathaway is the standout performer in this film. She has a remarkable ability to elevate even the most formulaic scripts, bringing nuance and depth to her character. Her performance is both heartfelt and engaging, making her character's journey compelling to watch. 

While the film includes many of the genre's typical elements, such as predictable plot points and moments of cheesy dialogue, it manages to use these conventions to its advantage. The familiar beats of the romantic drama are present but are handled with a light touch that makes them enjoyable rather than tiresome. 

This film is a pleasant surprise. It might not break new ground in the romantic drama genre, but it offers a heartwarming story with strong performances. It's an enjoyable movie to watch with your significant other, providing a comforting mix of romance, humor, and genuine emotion. If you're looking for a feel-good film that touches on themes of love and self-discovery, this one is definitely worth a watch.",2024-07-09T15:43:10.814Z,843527,4 stars,0.7803389430046082
CinemaSerf,5.0,"A group of twenty-somethings have rented a ""literal"" mansion (I wish writers would find out what that word means and use it properly!) and are having a few fireside beers outside it whilst subjecting us to their dull relationship issues. Needless to say the gang are a politically correct assemblage that tick just about every box and are frankly all pretty well deserving of what's to come. On that front, the clue's in the title. Exploring the house looking to top up their supply of booze, they find a locked room full of all things occult and that includes an unique set of tarot cards. Rather foolishly, but typically disparagingly, they demand that ""Haley"" (Harriet Slater) read their fortunes. Next thing they are dropping like flies - all in a manner they gradually realise is akin to the results of the tarot reading. As they gruesomely dwindle, they realise that they are going to need some help and so thanks to Google spook, they find a woman (Olwen Fouéré) who informs them of the bleak history of their toxic tarot and tells them that the cards' destruction might be their only road to salvation. Thing is, can they survive long enough to get back to the house? There's nothing at all original here, sorry. We've seen it loads of times before and the uninteresting dynamic between the characters is even more predictable than the denouement. To be fair, the candle-lit visual effects are quite effective at times, but the acting is pretty dreadful and the whole frat-like presentation left me looking at the clock after half an hour. It's a shame. The whole astrology and mythology surrounding the tarot could have offered us a rich vein to tap into and exploit, but here we simply get a rather lazy and formulaic light-horror enterprise that's really devoid of much imagination.

TheSceneSnobs,1.0,"Tarot was a terrible horror movie from start to finish. It’s another low-budget studio horror film that relies heavily on formulaic tropes, stacking one cliché after another in a convoluted story that makes no sense.

The plot is riddled with the usual horror clichés, making it predictable and uninspiring. For instance, the film features the classic haunted object, the mysterious stranger, and the inevitable jump scares. These elements, rather than building suspense or adding depth, only serve to make the narrative feel tired and unoriginal. The lack of creativity in the storyline means that even potential twists are telegraphed far in advance, leaving little room for genuine suspense.

The only bright spot in the film is Jacob Batalon, who adds some much-needed comedy to the otherwise dreary proceedings. His comedic timing provides brief relief from the monotony and gives the audience something to enjoy amidst the chaos but does little to improve the movie.

Even the horror elements, which should be the film’s strength, are poorly executed. The scare scenes are predictable and lack the punch necessary to leave a lasting impact. The build-up to these moments is often clumsy, with telegraphed scares that fail to deliver the desired jolt. 

On The Scene Snobs Channel, we believe that if you don't like a movie, you should recommend another. If you are not a fan of Tarot, I suggest watching 'Dead Silence' from 2007.

And the casting is quite bad as well because none of the actors really sell me on their performance, just seems they're phoning it in. The villain doesn't have a great performance either but that's mostly due to poor writing, they could've done something far greater than her. But the creativity that's present is short lived if it's constantly followed by a villain saying a poor landing joke, or even a main character.

How can a Garfield movie truly be done? After seeing this I have little hope for Garfield movies in the future.

One of the standout elements of the movie is the introduction of Garfield’s father, Vic. This addition brings a fresh perspective to the Garfield universe. The dysfunctional father-son dynamic adds depth to the story, making it more engaging. 

The plot cleverly intertwines this family dynamic with a heist storyline, which adds excitement and keeps the narrative moving at a brisk pace.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"There's a bit of the television series ""Kung Fu"" (no panda) to the start of this film as we see a young deaf/mute boy being intensively trained by a mysterious and highly-skilled shaman deep in the jungle. Why? Well it turns out that civilisation is being governed by the dastardly, seriously hammy, ""Van Der Koy"" family and that every year they round up their enemies and kill them all on live TV. Remind you of anything? Our nameless, muscle-bound, hero (Bill Skarsgård) has an axe to grind with them, and egged on by his mentor sets about wreaking revenge on them for killing his family. Sadly, there's nothing at all original throughout the rest of this pretty dull action thriller that relies too heavily on a slightly comedic narration (his thoughts) guiding us through some set-piece and repetitious combat scenes that after about fifteen minutes left us in no doubt as to the conclusion we were headed for. The more heavily armed soldiers you have guarding something, the easier it is for one man to... The arrival of Michelle Dockery and the sparingly used Famke Janssen add nothing at all, indeed the former is actually pretty terrible and doesn't become any more menacing just because she takes on a mid-Atlantic drawl. It's a fight/stunt co-ordinators' wet dream this film, but for the rest if us it's ""Hunger Games"" light. Very light.",2024-05-01T10:25:47.868Z,882059,2 stars,0.4679912328720093
MovieGuys,6.0,"Boy Kills World is a mash up of by now well known martial arts action genres. 

Perhaps the most obvious nod is to films like ""Kill Bill"" which in turn is a satirical parody, of cheesy 70's, 80's and 90's, martial arts action films. 

Boy Kills World is superficially quite watchable but it feels truncated. This is especially evident in terms of character development and grim comedy. 

Had it delved further into its potential for larger than life, well rounded characterisations and better exploited its rather dark humour, it could have become a bit of a cult hit. 

By contrast, its, at times, gratuitous violence, like the creative but painfully cringe worthy, cheese grater scene, is something, I personally felt, needed to be dialled down. 

In summary, a watchable martial arts action mash up with a cheesy nod to older films, in the genre. Let down a little by missed opportunities for character development and dark humour. Not to mention, at times, over the top violence.",2024-05-24T20:51:52.738Z,882059,3 stars,0.5318425893783569
Manuel São Bento,8.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://talkingfilms.net/the-fall-guy-review-a-thrilling-tribute-to-the-unsung-heroes-of-cinema/

""The Fall Guy emerges as a passionate ode to the brave, audacious stunt doubles, neglected by the film industry for so many decades. David Leitch offers an experience full of action, comedy, romance, and mystery, highlighted by the impressive physical feats performed by the stunt department, mostly without the aid of visual effects.

It’s a necessary tribute to those who risk their lives daily to elevate the entertainment power of cinema. Although it occasionally loses focus due to multiple storylines, the movie conveys a clear message about the importance of creative freedom and respect for all involved in filmmaking.

With charismatic performances by Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, as well as an energetic score by Dominic Lewis, this celebration of cinema and the hard work behind the scenes is one of this year’s must-see IMAX screenings.""

r96sk,8.0,"Undoubtedly fun, even if I did want a touch more from <em>'The Fall Guy'</em>.

The cast are great, definitely the film's strongest part in my opinion. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are an all-star pair and I enjoyed them both, they worked well together. Hannah Waddingham and Aaron Taylor-Johnson add good showings too. Stephanie Hsu and Winston Duke are involved as well.

The story produces entertainment, even if it could've had more flavour added to it. I felt watching that in a few parts it does overstay its welcome ever so slightly, not for a negative impact but enough that I couldn't rate it any higher. All the stunt stuff is fantastic though, as it ought to be given the subject matter. It's solid humour-wise, my favourite bits were actually the background actor interactions; s/o wife's sister guy.

Overall, I liked this one. Improvements were possible, though what's there is good enough - an easy watch, to be honest.",2024-05-03T19:31:11.032Z,746036,4 stars,0.7497814893722534
CinemaSerf,7.0,"This does suffer a bit from having been trailed to death in the cinema, and the story is really pretty thin - but there's some engaging chemistry on display between the two stars as their adventures hot up. ""Colt"" (Ryan Gosling) is the stunt double for the all action hero ""Tom Ryder"" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) whilst sort of dating aspiring director ""Jody"" (Emily Blunt). An accident on set drives ""Colt"" away from the business altogether until a random call from producer ""Gail"" (Hannah Waddingham) informs him that ""Jody"" is to direct her first film in Australia and he has been especially requested! Of course he hadn't, and when he turns up - much to the surprise of the production, they sort of settle for a truce as he gets back into the swing of rolling cars and jumping from burning wreckage. Where's the star though? Well it transpires that's what ""Gail"" has really brought him to establish. He's gone AWOL. Not for the first time, ""Ryder"" is a bit flaky - but all ""Colt"" need do is track down their wayward pretty boy and then he can escape this embarrassing scenario and go back home. Needless to say, his investigations soon immerse him in a dangerous world of drugs, unicorns and even more car chasing and pyrotechnics. Can he find his charge and maybe even restore his romance? There's precisely no jeopardy with any of that, even if there is quite a daft twist in the tale at the end, but that doesn't matter. This is an excuse for some good looking people to have fun celebrating the life of the movie stuntman. It's good fun to watch with Gosling oozing charisma as we go along on a trip that reveals just a little of the smoke and mirrors that is routinely used to convince us that what we see on screen is real - and that nobody usually dies! Sydney harbour is used to good effect, though I maybe wouldn't have wanted to be the general manager of the opera house when their film crew turned up, and the dialogue is quite a witty mix of hackneyed metaphor, old lines from famous movies and plenty of corn and cheese. ATJ doesn't really feature so much, but when he does he's clearly taking a pop at all things vain and superficial about the cult of image, and Blunt looks like she is enjoying herself as she tries to get her film in the can despite her missing frontman, the wrong kind of sand on the beach and her clearly having the hots for her ex. A good soundtrack helps it all along and though I doubt I'll recall much about this in three months, it's a lively poke at the characters that make movies and I quite enjoyed it.",2024-05-07T07:26:23.569Z,746036,3 stars,0.611550509929657

TheSceneSnobs,8.0,"It bothers me that this film didn't perform better at the box office. This movie is an incredibly fun ride with a stellar cast and some of the best action sequences I've seen on the big screen in years. The chemistry among the cast members is truly fantastic, elevating the film's enjoyment factor.

The cast is a significant highlight, with each actor bringing their A-game. The interactions between characters feel genuine, adding a layer of authenticity to the high-octane action. The camaraderie between the lead and his team is palpable, making their collective journey more engaging. This dynamic is particularly evident in scenes where quick banter and teamwork are essential, showcasing their rapport and adding to the film's overall appeal. 

I can attest that there isn't much that a crew of professional filmmakers can't do together in a short amount time with a good plan. The stunt team most of all! 

The action sequences are top-notch, meticulously choreographed, and thrilling to watch. The film excels in creating high-energy moments that are both visually spectacular and narratively compelling. 

I find myself torn about the film's release platform. On one hand, I wish it had been released on streaming so more people could have easily accessed and enjoyed it. On the other hand, this is precisely the kind of movie that benefits from the immersive experience of a theater. The grandiose action sequences and stunning visuals are best appreciated on the big screen, where their impact is maximized.

The movie fits into the current trend of ""hero"" films that blend traditional tough-guy action with emotional depth and vulnerability. Unlike older action heroes who often suppressed their emotions, the protagonists in this film openly confront their mental health issues and emotional struggles. This approach adds a refreshing twist to the genre, making the characters more relatable and human. For example, the lead character's journey includes moments of introspection and personal growth, highlighting his inner battles alongside the external conflicts.

Overall, this movie is a fantastic blend of action, heart, and camaraderie. It's a film that deserves to be seen and appreciated by a wider audience. Whether you're a fan of high-stakes action or character-driven narratives, this movie offers something for everyone. I highly recommend checking it out, especially on the big screen, to fully experience its exhilarating and emotional ride.",2024-07-09T14:51:04.156Z,746036,3 stars,0.4928937554359436

HappyPagan,7.0,"I'm disappointed. I was a huge fan of the series back in the day. But the movie didn't really try to capture the spirit of the show. It leans much more heavily towards being a generic romance movie. Although, to its credit, it does subvert quite a few of the romance tropes.

For an action movie that's supposed to be an homage to the unsung heroes of cinema, the stuntmen, it falls flat. I streamed the extended version, maybe the cinematic version was better. But the extended version was edited with the standard choppy style that didn't allow for the stunts to really shine. You're left with the impression that they cut to a different angle to hide something.

It wasn't all bad. It did have its moments. It was overall an enjoyable ride. And I'm pretty sure it's the first time in cinema history that a sound effect has had a cameo. No, I don't mean the Wilhelm scream. It was one of the best Easter eggs I've seen. But when that's the highlight of the film... well.",2024-09-01T15:13:41.438Z,746036,3 stars,0.5814219117164612

Sofia Boutella is enjoyable once more, but Ed Skrein isn't as interesting this time around; I would've preferred a new villain for this one, to be honest. Djimon Hounsou does have more to work with on this occasion though, which is only a positive thing. Bae Doo-na has a few nice moments, even if she is underused for the majority.

First of all, I gotta say, the proper poster is so good! Thankfully, the movie matches. I enjoyed my time watching this one, I do have some (very) minor issues with the pacing and music (that blaring club track is a bit much) but in truth they evaporate given how high quality the rest of the film is.

The cast are great. Zendaya is the obvious star of the 131 minutes, she is top notch throughout. Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist are just as impressive though, they more than hold their own alongside Zendaya. I've seen O’Connor before in TV's <em>'The Crown'</em> so I'm not all that surprised or anything, though this is the first time I've see Faist act.

Aside from the earlier noted track, the music is overall excellent though. I also like how the tennis is portrayed, I'm only a casual viewer of the sport but it all felt believable in that regard. I think the run time could've been trimmed a tad, while the amount of different timelines is perhaps a little excessive. Again, mind, these are not major concerns of mine, just worthy of noting.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Tennis playing ""Art"" (Mike Faist) and ""Patrick"" (Josh C'Connor) have been best mates since school but there's a fly in the ointment of their bromance. That's the upcoming superstar that is ""Tashi"" (Zendaya) - whom both of the boys take a shine to. A shared beer in their hotel room and she declares she's no home wrecker - but as this story progresses we arrive at a scenario that sees her own career aspirations tragically thwarted and rather vicariously transferred onto now husband ""Art"" whilst her ex-boyfriend ""Patrick"" and he now barely speak. Having won six slams, ""Art"" is running out of steam - but his unfulfilled wife is not ready for him to quit. Can he win an elusive US Open? For that matter, can he even win a confidence-building Challenger event in which he must beat his former friend. It's this match that serves as the conduit for the story as we dance about the timelines delivering a story that I felt was rife with pretty toxic ambition. Zendaya handles her really ambiguous, sometimes quite cruel and selfish, role here real quite unnervingly well as Luca Guadagnino allows all three actors to develop characteristics that vary from the engaging to the detestable - and he lets us be the judge. They are all flawed individuals spurned on by hormones, desire and the highly charged and competitive nature of their touring existences makes for quite a compelling look at just what makes these guys tick! After his appearance in ""Mothering Sunday"" (2021) O'Connor has no issues getting naked, the others prove a little more restrained as the sexual chemistry becomes more palpable and destructive and by the denouement - well who knows what will happen? I like that uncertainty - and I know what I wanted to occur... If you can't like yourself, can anyone else?",2024-04-30T09:22:22.718Z,937287,3 stars,0.4078553020954132
Cinema_Snobb,9.0,"While I have found Zendaya to be an attractive and stylish young woman, I haven't really warmed up to her as a serious actress all that much. She was fine in the ""Spider-Man"" franchise since it didn't require any great stretches for her. I feel that in the ""Dune"" series she is overshadowed by other, more talented actors. And in the more serious ""Malcolm and Marie"" she was in over her head in the cheap imitation of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?""

""Challengers"" is a big step for her as an actress. And while I do still feel as though her two co-stars were more convincing, I think that this part is a brave move into meatier and more challenging roles.

The film is told over a thirteen year period. Zendaya plays Tashi a rising star in the tennis world. She seems to be the next great thing. At one of the tournaments she meets Art and Patrick, played by Mike Faist and Josh O'Connor. They are also competitive tennis players and best friends. And they both fall for Tashi. Who wouldn't?

Over the next several years they each start a relationship with Tashi. Not surprisingly they grow apart, but their stories continue to intersect as they both move closer to an inevitable confrontation...both off and on the court.

It's the kind of movie that Hollywood rarely makes anymore. It's about people and their feelings, and their ambitions. It's not a sequel or a remake, or comic book. This is why I find stories about real human emotions to be so much more exciting than the latest, generic action retread. The plot is advanced by the things the characters say and how their emotions guide their futures.

The film offers ambiguous motivations. On the surface we see them caring for each other, but what lies deep beneath is a much more selfish reality that put them in a survival mode. Each of them is a well written being. There is no hero to the story...nor a villain.

While Zendaya holds her own, Faist and O'Connor are the best part. They move the story and are also the central interest to me. This is, after all a love story, but we don't really understand early that it is also an unconventional one between the two male characters as well. All three of them hold a certain amount of sexual tension between them.

If I was to have a small gripe, it would be that the last twenty minutes is stretched too long. I'm glad that the filmmakers didn't rush it like many films do, but...they do milk the final in too many slow motion and trick shots. It adds tension, but it gets close to making us lose a bit of interest as well. Just get on with it!",2024-05-01T15:41:29.153Z,937287,4 stars,0.4446108043193817
Horseface,3.0,"A story about a sociopathic, egocentric, racist narcissist who - not knowing what love is - treats two young men who both fall in love with her as pawns in a twisted game of life.

The havoc she wreaks, and the lives she break, are of no concern to her, as she continues on and on trying to satisfy her quench for power, control, and admiration.

It's not that I necessarily have a problem with films spun around an antagonist, or with demonic female characters, there's just something about the way it is on display in this film that makes me nauseous and tired. Perhaps it's the poor writing, or the lack of any real protagonist, as the two who are supposedly our protagonists are really willing victims, so it's hard to feel for them. Maybe it's the disorganized structure of the script. And pairing it with an atrocius score certainly doesn't help. 

Oh, and the supposed ""tennis"" they're playing is so far detached from actual tennis that you can't help but laugh out loud at times when the film is trying to be very dramatic. Quite unfortunate.

TheSceneSnobs,7.0,"Challengers presents an intriguing story centered around an unconventional love triangle with a twist. The film is well-crafted, showcasing impressive performances, direction, editing and cinematography.

The plot of Challengers revolves around the complex relationships between the three main characters, exploring themes of love, rivalry, and redemption. The story is engaging, with a narrative that keeps the audience invested in the characters' journeys. 

Mike Faist and Josh O'Connor deliver solid performances as Art and Patrick, two friends whose relationship becomes strained. Their chemistry feels authentic, adding to the film's emotional weight. 

However, Zendaya's performance as Tashi is the film's standout element. She commands every scene she is in, bringing depth and nuance to her character. Her portrayal of Tashi's internal conflicts and external manipulations is both compelling and believable. 

The film's technical aspects are equally impressive. The cinematography beautifully captures the film's mood, using lighting and framing to enhance the emotional impact of the scenes especially on the court. The editing is top-notch, ensuring a smooth narrative flow and maintaining the film's pacing. The seamless transitions between past and present help to build suspense and deepen the story.

Challengers is particularly appealing to younger generations and aspiring filmmakers. Its fresh take on a classic trope, combined with high-quality filmmaking, makes it a standout in contemporary cinema. The film's exploration of modern relationships and personal growth resonates well with a younger audience. Additionally, its artistic approach provides inspiration for filmmakers looking to push the boundaries of traditional storytelling.

Overall, Challengers is a well-made film with a compelling story and strong performances. Zendaya shines as Tashi, supported by the solid performances of Mike Faist and Josh O'Connor.

redlionking,-1.0,"A Game of Love, Rivalry, and Resilience

The Challengers, directed by Luca Guadagnino, serves up more than just a tennis love triangle—it’s a story about passion, ambition, and the lengths we go to reclaim our sense of self. Zendaya shines as Tashi Duncan, a once-dominant tennis star turned coach, whose life is as complex and intense as the sport she mastered.

This film takes the audience on a whirlwind of emotions, following Tashi’s journey as she navigates a challenging personal and professional dynamic between her husband, Art, and her ex-boyfriend, Patrick. What starts as a sports drama quickly evolves into a tale of love, loyalty, and the complicated ties that bind us. Guadagnino’s direction brings the tension of a tennis match to every scene, where every glance, word, and play feels like a volley in an emotional game that none of the characters are fully prepared for.

At the heart of The Challengers is a powerful message about resilience and the relentless pursuit of purpose. Tashi’s return to the court—albeit from the sidelines as a coach—is emblematic of her unwillingness to give up, even when her own dreams seem beyond reach. She embodies the law of assumption, believing in the possibilities that lie ahead, even when the present seems tangled in a web of broken relationships and lost potential. By daring to assume victory, not only in the game but in her own life, Tashi embraces a future filled with the abundance of second chances.

What makes this film so compelling is the complexity of its characters, all of whom are struggling with their own vulnerabilities. The tennis matches are metaphors for life’s battles—hard-fought, full of unpredictable twists, and always demanding more than expected. It’s in the emotional back-and-forth, the moments of doubt and the sparks of hope, that The Challengers truly comes alive.

Ultimately, The Challengers is about the fight to reclaim one’s identity and the power of belief—belief in love, in oneself, and in the idea that we are always capable of bouncing back from life’s toughest setbacks. It’s an inspiring, beautifully crafted film that reminds us, whether on the court or off, that every challenge we face is an opportunity to grow stronger.

If you’re looking for a story that blends high-stakes competition with profound personal growth, The Challengers is a must-watch. It serves up drama, passion, and the belief that, no matter the odds, we always have the strength to rise.",2024-10-22T18:07:24.136Z,937287,4 stars,0.6436055898666382

TheSceneSnobs,6.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare. Guy Ritchie crafts an intriguing story about Winston Churchill’s team of highly skilled misfit soldiers recruited for the dirtiest missions against the Germans. This film combines historical drama with Ritchie's signature style, resulting in an engaging and action-packed experience.

Henry Cavill stands out as the deranged leader of this unorthodox team, delivering a performance that balances madness with a fierce sense of duty. His character's unpredictable nature keeps the audience on edge.

Cavill stands out as the deranged leader of this unorthodox team, delivering a performance that balances madness with a fierce sense of duty. His character's unpredictable nature keeps the audience on edge. 

Simultaneously, the subplot involving two Allied spies embedded within the German ranks adds an exciting layer of espionage. Babs Olusanmokun and Eiza González deliver fantastic performances, navigating the perilous environment with a blend of cunning and bravery. 

However, not all elements of the film work seamlessly. The scenes featuring Winston Churchill are notably weaker, often disrupting the narrative flow and diminishing the film’s intensity. These moments feel out of place, detracting from the otherwise tight and focused storytelling. 

On the technical front, the film excels with masterful cinematography and outstanding sound design. The visual style captures the gritty and chaotic nature of war while maintaining clarity during intense action sequences. The sound design immerses the audience in the film’s world, from the clamor of battle to the subtle tension of stealth operations. 

The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is a compelling addition to the war film genre, distinguished by its strong performances, engaging dual storylines, and technical prowess.

Wuchak,6.0,"**_Snazzy WW2 flick about a brazen raid off the coast of West Africa_**

Churchill refuses to surrender to Germany and so backs the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which was the precursor to what is today known as black ops. The unorthodox team carry out Operation Postmaster in early 1942, a daring attack on an island near Cameroon to disrupt the Nazis' U-boat resupply operation.

Helmed by Guy Ritchie, ""The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare"" (2024) is similar in plot to 1968’s “Attack on the Iron Coast,” which covered the St Nazaire Raid on the shore of German-occupied France, a raid that happened to take place 2.5 months after Operation Postmaster. Interestingly, the SOE were considered for heading that raid (in the aftermath of the great success of Operation Postmaster), but the mission was determined to be beyond the capabilities of the small-scale group.

While the plot is reminiscent of “Attack on the Iron Coast,” the ‘hip,’ smirky style is along the lines of Tarantino’s “Inglourious Basterds,” mixed with bits of “The Dirty Dozen” and “Where Eagles Dare.” If you favor those movies, you’ll probably like this one, but it’s the least of ’em IMHO with the exception of the low-budget “Attack on the Iron Coast,” which was shot in B&W.

Don’t get me wrong, this is a top-of-the-line production with a quality cast, including the likes of Henry Cavill, Alan Ritchson, Eiza González and Babs Olusanmokun. It just needed a little more human interest to draw me into the characters and care about the manic events.

The dynamic score brings to mind Spaghetti Westerns and includes a piece that rips off “Immigrant Song.”

It runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot at Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, London, and Antalya on the southwest coast of Turkey.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"I don't know that I've heard Tchaikovsky ever used so menacingly before, but here his ""Swan Lake"" and some deadly pas seul are used to good effect! A group of kidnappers has been assembled by ""Lambert"" (Giancarlo Esposito) to kidnap the daughter of a wealthy man. They are to whisk her away to a remote, quite spooky, manor house where she is to be held hostage til dad stumps up $50m. Thing is, this butter-wouldn't-melt little girl has a secret even bigger than most of the rather disparate gang of folks who used their complementary skills to snatch her. These folks are led by ""Frank"" (Dan Stevens) and it's ""Joey"" (Melissa Barrera) who is left to keep an eye on the young ""Abigail"" (Alisha Weir). Quite quickly we realise that it's not her who is trapped in their web, but vice-versa and what now ensues sees quite a fun series of daft and gruesome encounters as their gang gradually dwindles and they have to fight for their lives! It runs out of steam a bit towards the ending - which seems to happen quite a few times, but a solid cast including the entertaining Kevin Durand and Kathryn Newton, some quickly paced direction and some pithy writing keeps most of this moving along with the diverse range of characters (and intellects) making for quite an enjoyable romp in a sort of ""Cluedo"" with loads of ketchup style.

MovieGuys,6.0,"Abigail isn't exactly a novel idea but its executed convincingly enough to offer up a moderately watchable, horror, experience.

In spite of its grounding in vampiric horror, I didn't find Abigail especially frightening. There's no sense of creeping menace and frankly, that's a shame. It does ""have a go"", so to speak, at first but never really takes it far enough or handles the material subtly enough, to pull it off.

Instead, Abigail is more in line with you standard vampire fare, where for the majority of the film you know who and what, you are dealing with. This tends to move the narrative and exposition, more towards a bloody action framework. 

This film is not unwatchable, don't get me wrong. The acting is decent, the setting appropriately creepy and the horror sequences are polished. That said, I did find myself feeling like I'd seen it all before, in one sense or another.The ending fizzes when it could have ""popped"", too.

In summary, Abigail's handling feels like a missed opportunity to do something far more terrifying and creepily menacing, than what we get with the actual final product. Not bad but nothing special.",2024-05-10T04:11:04.596Z,1111873,3 stars,0.6268855929374695
r96sk,10.0,"Boy did this one catch me by surprise! I absolutely loved watching <em>'Abigail'</em>! An unexpected gem!

I knew nothing pre-watch aside from that it was classed, on Wikipedia at least, as horror, so was simply expecting the usual fare à la <em>'Imaginary'</em> and/or <em>'Immaculate'</em> (former bad, latter good fwiw). Clearly, what I in fact saw knocked my socks off! I had a tremendous amount of fun with every second of this, it's unsettling as it is amusing... every department did a grand job!

Not even sure where to start with my list of many positives. Alisha Weir is the star of the whole thing, what an utterly brilliant performance from the youngster - so damn convincing, particularly early on. Melissa Barrera is also outstanding, I previously found her fairly forgettable in <em>'Scream'</em> but here I undeniably liked watching her act. Dan Stevens (another I've found 'meh' elsewhere) impresses as well, as does Kathryn Newton. Heck, everyone onscreen is great.

I love how they showed the bloody (and the blood in general) body implosions, great use of (I assume) practical and special effects - proper thrilled me each time. I was happy to see the film get straight into the plot too, no messing about. It does a good job after that opening portion in setting up the characters before the mess truly hits the fan, which is when the movie seriously clicks into gear. Everything from that point on was an absolute blast - quite literally, eh?!

Going back to that opening few scenes, I was actually a touch concerned when it went from the initial fun escape to a one-location dynamic; I thought that was going to slow it down and make it more in keeping with the vibes of those two earlier 2024 movies that I noted at the top of my review. However, each moment in that one location is fantastic to watch, I have zero complaints. It's all paced to perfection!

Almost stunned at how much I enjoyed this, probably because I wasn't expecting anything from it. Looking at my ratings I've just now realised that I weirdly haven't got a favourite horror movie. According to the Letterboxd sort, I haven't even rated any films from this genre at anything above 9/10 - and even with that score it's only nine flicks, none of which I strongly adore. An unnoticed blind spot in my taste is evidently no longer.

The reviews for this seem generally favourable (at worst), which is nice to see. I've seen many online in agreement with me, what a ride! Not that it needs stating, but I'd highly recommend you check this one out!",2024-05-16T23:40:01.313Z,1111873,5 stars,0.4783368706703186
TheSceneSnobs,6.0,"Abigail is a fun, action-driven vampire movie that seamlessly blends good comedy with its supernatural elements and violence. The film offers a delightful mix of thrills and humor, making for an enjoyable viewing experience.

The standout performances in the film elevate its overall impact. Dan Stevens brings a charismatic presence to his role, delivering both action and comedic moments with ease. Melissa Barrera also shines, adding depth to her character with a nuanced performance. However, it is Alisha Weir as the young vampire Abigail who truly steals the show. Her portrayal is both endearing and fierce, capturing the complexities of a young vampire navigating a chaotic world.

It is always a pleasure to see Giancarlo Esposito on screen, and his role in Abigail is no exception. He brings a gravitas to the film that balances the lighter, more chaotic elements. I would have preferred more of his character in the film.

The rest of the cast is a mixed bag of chaotic characters that fit well within the tone of this horror comedy. While some characters are more memorable than others, they collectively contribute to the film’s energetic and unpredictable atmosphere. 

The comedy in Abigail is well-timed and effectively breaks up the tension of the action scenes. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, allowing for playful moments that enhance its entertainment value. The twists, while not entirely unexpected, are executed with enough flair to keep the audience invested. For example, a late-film revelation about Abigail's origins adds an intriguing twist to the narrative, adding depth to her character and setting up potential future installments.",2024-07-09T15:27:01.905Z,1111873,4 stars,0.7334482073783875

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,7.0,"I feel like “Abigail” is going to be one of those horror movies that audiences and genre fans really like. This latest project from Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett has everything you’d want in a film, and it delivers on them all. From its wicked sense of humor and slightly taunting tone to its fully committed, talented cast and plenty of bloody gore, this is one entertaining ride from start to finish.

A menagerie of would-be criminals (Melissa Barrera, Dan Stevens, Kathryn Newton, Kevin Durand, Angus Cloud and William Catlett) have taken a mysterious job at the behest of a man named Lambert (Giancarlo Esposito) to kidnap Abigail (Alisha Weir), the preteen ballerina daughter of a very powerful figure in the underworld. It’s a $50 million ransom and payday, and the gang holes up in a creepy old mansion overnight until her daddy makes with the cash. Nothing goes according to plan, and they’re especially thrown for a loop when they eventually discover that they’re trapped inside not only with no way out, but with a 12-year-old girl who is definitely not normal.

It’s a very simple premise and story, but everyone involved makes the most of it. The film exceeds expectations, and it’s so much better and more satisfying than you’d expect. A lot of that is due to the terrific cast and performances, stylish directing, and a series of genuine surprises and twists that are both shocking and sometimes even silly. (In fact, the story’s surprises are one of the biggest strengths, so avoid all spoilers if you want to have the most fun watching this one).

Another thing that sets the film apart is its unexpectedly well-developed characters. In a genre often filled with simple throwaways, screenwriters Stephen Shields and Guy Busick take the time to flesh out each character, making their backgrounds, struggles, and terror feel real. While the adults are understated for the most part, Weir tends to overdo it a bit in some of the later scenes. Her dramatic (and a little goofy) performance, especially when ballerina dancing is combined with throat-ripping, just screams out “corny horror movie.” But that’s also what makes it all so entertaining.

Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett include a handful of lazy jump scares but never rely on them, which is refreshing. There are plenty of bloody and gross moments that’ll appease fans looking for grisly effects, and even those are played with a lightly farcical touch. I wouldn’t call this film scary, but it’s definitely amusing.

There are some glaring plot holes, so your willingness to look the other way will probably be a major deciding factor if you’ll enjoy or hate this one. It’s a straightforward story, but it’s also clear a lot of effort has been put into every aspect of the movie. “Abigail” knows exactly what it wants to be and delivers on that promise.

tmdb51616167,7.0,"I went into ""Abigail"" expecting a chilling horror movie with a unique ballerina twist, but I was surprised to find it leaning more towards comedy. The exaggerated fight scenes between adults and a young girl provided some comedic moments that had me chuckling.

While the film does explore character development, it unfortunately disposes of two characters without much impact. Despite this flaw, the plot's unexpected twists and turns keep the story engaging and make for an overall enjoyable viewing experience.

The final act may feel a bit chaotic, but the climactic battle scene is reminiscent of classic movie showdowns, adding to the excitement. Melissa Barrera's presence in the film harkens back to her role in the ""Scream"" franchise, evoking a sense of nostalgia.

Unfortunately, the film falters in its conclusion with an unnecessary cameo from the father, disrupting the emotional dynamic of Joey. This misstep detracts from an otherwise entertaining movie.",2024-09-02T20:52:22.379Z,1111873,3 stars,0.7140410542488098

Manuel São Bento,6.0,"ABIGAIL is a stylish, bloody vampire flick that thrives on its energetic performances and slick production quality. Melissa Barrera, Dan Stevens, and Alisha Weir shine in their roles, with Weir in particular proving to be a standout young talent. Matt Bettinelli-Olpin & Tyler Gillett's partnership continues to be incredibly successful, blending humor, action, and horror seamlessly. Really fun atmosphere, making it an entertaining ride from start to finish.

While the film impresses visually and keeps a fast-paced momentum, it lacks depth in its storytelling. The plot feels familiar, sticking closely to vampire genre tropes without much thematic exploration. Yet, for those looking for a light, enjoyable experience with excellent performances and sharp direction, ABIGAIL delivers exactly that. It's not groundbreaking, but it's worth watching for fans of stylish horror.

Wuchak,6.0,"**_“And Then There Were None” meets “The Lost Boys” meets Tarantino_**

Several kidnappers take a 12 years-old ballerina captive and hold her at a locked-down mansion until her filthy rich father pays up. But this ain’t no typical little rich girl.

“Abigail” (2024) is amusing horror in the mold of “From Dusk Till Dawn” meshed with ""We Summon the Darkness.” The basic plot is old hat if you consider “The Beast Must Die” from fifty years earlier and ""Howling V: The Rebirth"" from the late 80s. Yet it works well for the first 85 minutes before devolving into splatter horror overkill, like the original “Scream” did.

Interestingly, Elon Musk and Joan Jett are featured in the cast. Not really, but it seems like it (I’m talking about Kevin Durand and Melissa Barrera respectively). Speaking of brunette Barrera, she’s a highlight on the feminine front along with blonde Kathryn Newton.

While not of the caliber of “From Dusk Till Dawn,” it’s superior to ""We Summon the Darkness.”

It was shot in Dublin and is overlong at 1 hour, 49 minutes. They shoulda tightened it up by shaving off 15-20 minutes.

MovieGuys,7.0,"Its nice to see Nicolas Cage in a film deserving of his talents. 

Arcadian is not an exceptional horror thriller but what it does do, is done competently enough to be deserving of praise. It has a serviceable story, that reminds me a little of ""A Quiet Place"" from 2018. The core premise is not quite the same but the monster effects are similar, as is the rural setting. 

The tension is ratcheted up nicely as the story progresses. As is always the case with what is essentially a survivalist horror, we know the creatures are going to get in but what happens next is, of course, the interesting part. Along the way we get to know the key characters, including Cages father figure. His effective absence part way through film and his return near the end, is a little disappointing but given this film has a coming of age component, its understandable. 

Acting is decent throughout and you can certainly relate to the plight of Cages little ad-hoc family. The creature effects work well enough too but somehow, they are just not all that creepy or especially menacing. This tends to rob the film of a real post apocalyptic horror vibe. I think revealing exactly what they are, early on, was a mistake too that took away any reveal/jump scare potential, from the film. 

All that said, Arcadian is in most respects a worthwhile watch that you should consider adding to your horror/thriller inventory. Definitely worth a look.",2024-05-02T04:19:24.404Z,1051896,4 stars,0.6220093369483948

No, I didn't say it was original, but it's quite well paced as the loved-up ""Thomas"" manages to get a bit too close to these nocturnal monsters which causes his father to get injured and requires ""Joseph"" - the brains of the family (who reminded me the entire time of Dan Radcliffe) to come up with some clever ruses to keep the whole lot of them alive. Cage barely features which is no bad thing here as the two boys and girlfriend ""Charlotte"" (Sadle Soverall) make a perfectly good job of keeping the thing moving along quickly and quite entertainingly for and hour and an half. The visual effects aren't the best, but the claustrophobic settings; the regular axe-wielding; a fair bit of burrowing and a the help of a chest freezer work fine.

TheSceneSnobs,5.0,"As a long-time fan of Nic Cage, I went into Arcadian with high expectations. The trailer was intriguing, hinting at a familiar story with potential for new and exciting directions. However, the film felt like two different movies in one. While I enjoyed both aspects separately, they didn't blend well together.

The film starts with a grounded, realistic tone that sets up an engaging story. Nic Cage delivers a solid performance, immersing himself in a character that is both relatable and compelling. However, the narrative takes a sharp turn into absurdist territory, introducing elements that feel out of place in the established world. For example, the grounded scenes where Cage's character navigates personal challenges are suddenly juxtaposed with bizarre, otherworldly events that disrupt the film's coherence.

The grounded part of the story focuses on Cage's character dealing with real-world issues, offering a nuanced exploration of his psyche. This segment is filled with strong character development and emotional depth. In contrast, the absurdist elements, featuring creatures that seem to belong in a different genre, clash with the film's initial tone. 

While it's possible to successfully combine grounded and absurdist elements in a film, Arcadian struggles to achieve this balance. The creatures introduced do not fit seamlessly into the world we are shown, leaving many questions unanswered. The lack of cohesion between the two parts of the story makes it difficult for the audience to stay engaged. 

The film raises intriguing questions about the nature of reality and perception but fails to provide satisfying answers or connections between the disparate elements.

Despite its narrative shortcomings, Arcadian boasts solid acting and impressive cinematography. Nic Cage's performance is a highlight, bringing intensity and authenticity to his role. The cinematography enhances the film's atmosphere, capturing both the grounded and surreal elements with skill. 

Arcadian is a film with strong individual components that fail to coalesce into a unified whole. The acting and cinematography are commendable, but the disjointed narrative undermines the film's potential. To improve, a more seamless integration of the grounded and absurdist elements would be necessary, providing clearer connections and answers to the questions posed. Despite its flaws, the film offers moments of intrigue and is worth watching for fans of Nic Cage and experimental cinema.",2024-07-09T15:51:50.517Z,1051896,3 stars,0.5832933187484741

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Truth, if it were needed, that Lesley Manville can turn her hand to anything, but otherwise this is a rather unremarkable biopic of a woman whose character, I must confess, I didn't actually like very much. She is the nan of Amy (Marisa Abela) and the two have a special bond. Amy lives with her mum who is divorced from her dad Mitch (Eddie Marsan). He fancies himself as a bit of a crooner and she is steeped in jazz, determined to write her own songs and make a success of herself - on her own terms. Enter Nick (Sam Buchanan) who works for music mogul Simon Fuller and she is, after an initial bit of hostility, signed up and on her way. The remainder of the chronology is all pretty straightforward as Sam Taylor-Johnson decides to focus on an entirely speculative look at how her personal life developed. Amy's increasingly strained relationship with her friends and her father, her grandmother's terminal illness and her ""toxic co-dependent"" relationship with the charismatic Blake (Jack O'Connell). There's no doubting that many of her songs are great - even if the role of Mark Ronson in any of that is largely ignored, and hats off to Abela for putting her own slant on them. She does her own singing and though she does rather over-egg it, she does imbue a sense of the sheer force of personality this woman had. O'Connell, too, does well enough - especially with his Shangri-La dance in the pub when they meet, but somehow the whole narrative is just too bitty and episodic. The presentation of her character is way too shallow and frankly she is portrayed as a bit of an obnoxious brat. Her increasing exposure to the hounding paparazzi is well illustrated and that growing sense of exasperation obvious, but again we jump around too much as we seem to be rushing to a conclusion we know all about. At two hours it is too long in many ways and too short in others. The dialogue offers us little insight into just who she was and by the end, I felt sad for her but can't say I really cared about any of them. The aggression of the photographers seems to receive a disproportionate share of the blame for her predicament whilst rather discounting her own series of bad choices fuelled by her own immaturity and by the public's obsessions with watching what it builds up come crashing down. They couldn't sell their photos if we didn't want to buy them. A memorable musical legacy left behind by one who, along with so many other ground-breaking but flawed musical geniuses, might just have been better left for our ears.",2024-04-10T09:25:56.411Z,998846,3 stars,0.5728915333747864

""Back to Black completely fails in adapting Amy Winehouse’s life to the big screen, falling into common biopic traps, and drowning in them. The film not only disrespectfully omits and revises critical facts from the artist’s life but also fails to convey the emotional depth of her music and the challenges she faced.

By turning her story into a superficial, cheap version, not even Marisa Abela’s remarkable performance can save the horrendous work of Sam Taylor-Johnson and Matt Greenhalgh.

It deserves no recommendation, serving only as an example of what to avoid when adapting the life of a real person to cinema.""

r96sk,6.0,"<em>'Back to Black'</em> is not the best.

The opening chunk of the movie, say the first 30-45 minutes, is not good, a very rocky beginning. The introduction to the characters felt unnatural, the spontaneous moments of the lead character (who they make a tiny bit unlikeable at around that point) singing... borderline cringe. I will say, though, from after that the film does improve, funnily enough once the titular track plays I enjoyed this more.

Now for the cast. Marisa Abela is, acting-wise, decent enough, I'm not sold on her likeness to Amy Winehouse but I only really know of the musician minimally in her later years so I could very likely be wrong to question it to be fair. Her accent forced as well, though that could be a similar case as to what I just mentioned with the resemblance.

I did feel like I was watching Abela acting like Winehouse, rather than Winehouse portrayed by Abela. What I mean by that is in the best biopics I feel like I'm watching the person depicted, almost documentary-esque, but here it felt more obvious that I was watching someone act as someone, if that makes sense. Same can be said for Jack O'Connell, I know zero about Blake Fielder-Civil but still felt like O'Connell was overtly imitating someone.

There are positives, though. Lesley Manville puts in a good performance, her scenes with Abela are the film at its strongest. Eddie Marsan is solid too. It also does what's needed to make you care for the main character, even if that isn't all that difficult. Winehouse's big songs, at least all the ones I know of, are featured well; I most liked 'Valerie' years back, but that eponymous track really is outstanding.

No doubt super sad how Winehouse's life played out, I knew she died fairly young but when the epilogue details that she passed at just 27 it really does hit hard... such a waste. As for this movie in itself, mind, it's not all that unfortunately.",2024-04-16T17:18:27.204Z,998846,3 stars,0.4725838303565979

A film that transcends political boundaries, focusing on war journalism, the moral dilemmas faced by those who risk their lives to tell stories that cannot be ignored, and the personal transformation necessary to carry out such an inhuman task.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Nope, sorry, this just didn't work for me. It appears that there is a civil war amongst these United States. California and Texas have seceded from the Union and Florida seems to be having a wobble too. The President (Nick Offerman) makes a speech assuring the rest of his country that they've nothing to worry about, but hardened photo-journalist ""Lee"" (Kirsten Dunst) and her cohort ""Joel"" (Wagner Moura) reckon that the conflict is quite likely to come to an altogether different conclusion. They bravely decide to travel the 800-odd miles to Washington DC to try and interview him. Their out-of-shape veteran associate ""Sammy"" (Stephen McKinley Henderson) thinks they are mad, but also wants in on the trip. Meantime, the enthusiastic young photographer ""Jessie"" (Cailee Spaeny) has managed to hook up with the team and so, rather implausibly, they agree to take her on this perilous journey. It's that implausibility that carries the whole thing as the completely preposterous scenario unfolds before us. No effort is made to fill us in on the cause of this warfare. Did the President seize power? Was he elected from a party these states didn't vote for? Are they just brutal and well armed revolutionaries? Then we have the ridiculous dialogue - usually from Henderson with his ""always take fuel when you can"" or ""this way only leads to death"" type profundities as the group travel through a remarkably stable, well fuelled and provisioned, nation where there's hardly the merest hint of mass migrations, fear or terror. Indeed, their blue ""Press"" helmets and a little bit of kevlar seem to render them immune to the deadly drama that they are supposed to be experiencing. Jesse Plemons makes a brief appearance - that actually leads to the only vaguely exciting part of this chronology, but otherwise it's all a bit on a non-event. Dunst starts off as a strong and characterful woman but that dwindles away and, well, I was just a bit bored as the denouement hoved into view with all the predicability of the sun coming up.

The filmmaker’s gripping tale of a quartet of journalists (Kirsten Dunst, Wagner Moura, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Cailee Spaeny) covering a civil war in a dystopian version of America of the near future follows the reporters as they make their way from New York to Washington via a circuitous route that shows them all sides of this nightmarish scenario. Essentially a road trip film, “Civil War” provides the principals and viewers with an array of images and situations graphically depicting what’s left of the US as a distraught population attempts to make sense of the circumstances and find ways to survive. The purpose of the protagonists’ journey is to secure an interview (likely the last one) with a corrupt, egomaniacal President (Nick Offerman) as rebel forces close in on the capital. They set out on this treacherous odyssey despite the dangers involved both in making the trip and in their roles as journalists, who are looked on with suspicion and have been accused of fanning the flames of the hostilities. While some have complained that the film doesn’t provide enough social and political background about the conflict, I submit that this consideration is fundamentally unnecessary: Garland is making an unadulterated statement here that, when the bullets start flying, ideology won’t matter and no one will care, a point driven home with chilling clarity over and over. The madness that consumes the population is all that’s important at that juncture, one driven by bald-faced hostility on steroids both among the combatants and the overzealousness of the reporters in seeking to “get the story,” no matter what. In achieving this end, the filmmaker holds nothing back, making this an often-difficult watch, one definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart. But the picture’s message is one of grave importance, especially in today’s trying, polarized climate. We’d be wise to pay attention to what’s being said in this important work, handily the best – and most troubling – release of 2024 thus far.",2024-04-14T17:07:12.331Z,929590,4 stars,0.44795748591423035
edrddz,7.0,"The film, although set in a context of armed conflict, deviates from the traditional war theme to focus on war photojournalists, promoting a perspective on the work of such professionals. Through a series of small scenes, the director seeks to compose a portrait of these professionals' actions on the battlefield without declaring the reasons for the war or identifying the sides involved.

Each scene, individually, is well-executed, standing out for the quality of cinematography and an immersive sound work that amplifies the tension. However, these scenes, although effective individually, fail to come together cohesively. The result is a film that seems less than the sum of its parts. The main problem with the film is a lack of depth.

Although technically well-produced, particularly in terms of audio, the film falls short of a deeper approach, which could have elevated it from a mere display of impactful scenes to a truly impactful work.",2024-04-29T22:44:14.979Z,929590,2 stars,0.48295357823371887
MovieGuys,6.0,"In spite of its pretensions, Civil War is essentially a derivative affair filled with  calculatedly disturbing visuals and violent exposition.

Character development and a functioning back story are largely absent, from Civil War. This is an exposition driven road trip from hell, with a nihilistic objective, that plays out to a predictable conclusion. 

That does not really leave a lot, for the viewer, to take away from this film. A film which should have a lot to say but is, instead, conspicuously silent. Perhaps this is a reaction to the climate of division and fear that exists in the USA today? That said, why make a film about something contentious, if you have nothing contentious to say?

In summary, this film really needed to be more opinionated, even if that means offering up opposing perspectives. Instead, it offends no one (as is the norm these days) by saying little to nothing, of any real consequence.",2024-05-23T21:43:18.032Z,929590,2 stars,0.5139118432998657

TheSceneSnobs,7.0,"This film is wonderfully chilling, with an atmosphere that haunts you long after the credits roll. The familiar settings of cities, towns, and roads serve as a stark backdrop to a raging war within the United States, creating a sense of unsettling normalcy disrupted by chaos.

The film’s atmosphere is one of its strongest elements, expertly crafted to keep viewers on edge. The juxtaposition of familiar, everyday settings with the terror of internal conflict adds a layer of realism that intensifies the horror. 

Kirsten Dunst delivers one of her best performances in this film, bringing depth and nuance to her role. Her portrayal captures the fear, resilience, and complexity of a character navigating through turmoil. The supporting cast is equally fantastic, each bringing their characters to life with authenticity and emotional weight. 

The film’s themes are deeply resonant, exploring the terrifying implications of a society on the brink of collapse. The narrative delves into the human psyche, examining how people react under extreme pressure and the moral dilemmas they face. 

In conclusion, this movie is a masterclass in atmospheric horror. It sticks with you like a dark cloud, leaving a lasting impression with its chilling narrative and powerful performances. The entire cast deliver exceptional work, supported by top-notch filmmaking that brings every terrifying detail to life. This film is not just a horror story but a poignant reflection on the human condition, making it a must-watch for fans of the genre and anyone seeking a thought-provoking cinematic experience.",2024-07-09T14:37:16.683Z,929590,5 stars,0.7334844470024109
PeaceMeal,3.0,"I was very interested in watching Civil War for a number of reasons. Mainly I wanted to see how the various political sides were portrayed in the very divided ""United"" States.  Indeed, there are many countries in the world that are near evenly split amongst two groups: High Government Involvement (money, immigration, etc.) vs. Free Market Capitalism.

Unfortunately, there was no coverage of that in Civil War, with the only difference being regions, letting you imagine on your own the differences. They are relying on a regional stereotype to push that the ""South"" is made up of angry white people that just like killing those that don't agree with them.  That put the movie right away into a political category.

When the movie had finished, I was left with some lasting feelings that were intentionally pushed by the story and director:
1) the international press are the only real heroes; 2) all American white men just like war and killing.

It's unfortunate that this seemed to be the main narrative from start to finish. There were so many missed opportunities.

Summary:  The was like a little like watching the movie Apocalypse Now with the sole main character being the press photographer who was always portrayed as the hero.

The writer and director pushed that those many wartime videographers had a large audience that only desired seeing the upclose expressions from people that were shot and dying. They also pushed that they would be so highly respected and protected from all waring sides. Those continual assumptions caused the movie to lose significant realism.

With such a large production budget and vast thirst for this movie topic, Civil War was a major letdown. Better writing and direction could have made this a movie blockbuster. Instead, it won't be remembered in 3-5 years, and certainly no one would every consider rewatching it.",2024-10-26T17:02:31.965Z,929590,2 stars,0.497104287147522

r96sk,9.0,"Slightly too long, but pretty much every other element of <em>'Monkey Man'</em> is more than enough to compensate.

I had a very good time watching what is Dev Patel's directorial debut. He himself is outstanding, having portrayed the role of the titular character perfectly. I had only seen the guy in two films (<em>'Slumdog Millionaire'</em> & <em>'The Last Airbender'</em>) prior to this, so very much happy to see him act further. An excellent job from him on and off screen, I'm happy that he managed to get this made in the end.

As noted, I do think the run time could've been trimmed a little. It's not a major issue of mine, at all, but at a few moments I did feel my interest wane a bit. The story itself is a good one though, one that is entwined with a lot of fight (literally) but a lot of feeling too. Visually, it's a beauty. As for those behind Patel, Pitobash and Vipin Sharma are positives; Ashwini Kalsekar does well too.

""Monkey Man shows that Dev Patel still has much to learn when it comes to directing and writing, but his unwavering commitment to a culturally and thematically rich story deserves countless praises.

A revenge arc with some pacing issues narrative-wise, but with action sequences loaded with energy and adrenaline, even when chaotically choreographed and shot. Predictably dedicated performance from Patel that avoids some genre formulas while paying homage to some of the classics that inspired him.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Dev Patel has spoken a lot about him not wanting to be ""James Bond"" but it looks like those stories have inspired quite a bit of this pretty derivative revenge thriller that actually reminded me a bit of his ""Hotel Mumbai"" (2018) outing too. We know that he (""Kid"") routinely dons a monkey mask for some wrestling and he duly gets a pasting - but that this all has purpose. That purpose starts to come together when he manages to organise a subtle sting operation on ""Queenie"" (Ashwini Kalsekar) who runs an high-end gentleman's club. His reward here is a job. In the kitchens, bleaching the toilets and washing the pots. A means to an end though as he befriends the drug-pusher ""Alphonso"" (Pitobash) - who has a nifty, turbo-charged, tuk-tuk, and is soon elevated to the rank of waiter to the corrupt and profligate of city society who frequent the place. Interspersed with his burgeoning career, we begin to see flashbacks of his childhood - and of the brutality that reduced him to his present, vengeful, circumstances. The story is set against a backdrop of political turmoil and with an election looming, he becomes aware that there are wheels within wheels and that his principle antagonist is firmly amongst the secular and religious plotters. He also finds himself being cared for by a sagely monk ""Alpha"" (Vipin Sharma) who helps him to focus both his mind and his body as we build to a denouement that can be seen from space by anyone who's ever seen a ""John Wick"" film. Patel is a charismatic man but that's not what's needed here. That's something just a little more original to keep this over-long two hours from becoming just a bit dull and procedural. It's not terrible, but it's not really up to much either.",2024-04-10T14:04:04.157Z,560016,3 stars,0.5306771397590637

cleverashu,7.0,"There's a recurrent metaphor throughout the film, of Hanuman trying to eat the sun leaping towards it Icarus-like and being stopped by the gods eventually. Maybe Dev Patel was aware of how well this metaphor would encapsulate his brave directorial debut too, all throughout the film he's trying to reach the narrative he wants to tell but he eventually pulls his own punches. Only if he knew his film would eventually not release in Indian theaters at all, howmuchever he restrains himself.

Don't get me wrong, this is a highly enjoyable film. But the commentary on the current Indian society and what is plaguing it and all the classist and casteist divides we have setup within ourselves -- all of that comes out a tad bit feeble and a bit too watered-down.

You can see Dev touching majorly on religious blind-faith intermingling with politics, but also offhandedly on caste and patriarchy too -- there's even a montage of real-life videos of a few of these evils thrown in for good measure -- but everything is a bit too sanitised and it doesn't jolt you. Not for a single moment did the film drown me in itself with these thoughts, always swimming on the surface. Water and fire are another recurrent tropes which occur throughout, another piece of foresight by Dev on how his fire would eventually be watered and we would just swim on the surface of it.

Having said that all out, I completely dig the film for its action and how it tries to mix Indian music and instruments throughout. **There's Zakir Hussain in it ffs, now THAT is what true cameos should be like, completely unexpected and swooping you in.** I've always liked Dev's performance and here he proves he's as good behind the camera as he is on it. It was great to see familiar Indian faces as well. There's also one homage to _Ghajini_ in there which I feel was a great nod.

One last piece of critique and then I would leave: the fictional cities and villages all feel lived-in and real, but at the same time a little bit Westernised too to be uniquely identified as Indian.",2024-04-28T12:12:31.739Z,560016,4 stars,0.5561878681182861
TheSceneSnobs,8.0,"When I saw the trailer for Monkey Man, I was unsure of what to expect. It seemed like a standard revenge tale with a horror twist. However, what I got was one of my favorite films of the year. Dev Patel shines not only in his acting but also in his directing. This film is much more than another John Wick type of movie; it delves into deep themes and presents a complex narrative that I thoroughly enjoyed.

Initially, the trailer gave the impression of a conventional revenge story with some horror elements. However, the film exceeds these expectations by offering a richer, more nuanced narrative. The themes explored are profound, touching on revenge, justice, and the human condition. 

Dev Patel's dual role as actor and director is impressive. His performance is both intense and layered, bringing depth to his character's journey. Additionally, his direction is sharp, balancing action with moments of introspection.

The film is more than just an action-packed revenge story; it explores deeper themes that resonate on multiple levels. The narrative examines the nature of revenge and its impact on the individual and society. For example, the protagonist's quest isn't just about personal vendetta but also about addressing the broader corruption and injustice in the city. This thematic depth sets the film apart from more straightforward action movies.

My biggest gripe is that the story could benefit from a longer runtime (which I NEVER say). The film occasionally feels rushed, particularly in the latter half when the protagonist begins his hunt. More time to build tension and develop interactions would enhance the overall impact. 

Despite this minor flaw, the movie is fantastic. It stands out for its strong performances, thoughtful direction, and complex narrative. Dev Patel has proven himself as a talented filmmaker capable of delivering both action and substance. I look forward to seeing more from him in the future and hope he continues to explore and expand on these rich themes.",2024-07-09T15:57:21.014Z,560016,5 stars,0.496559739112854
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,8.0,"Fans of elevated revenge action films are going to be flat-out dazzled by “Monkey Man,” the directorial debut of Dev Patel (who also co-wrote and stars as the titular character). Many actors are unsuccessful when attempting to make the transition from in front of the camera to behind it, but Patel has the talent to back it up tenfold. This story of vengeance is done so well that I have very few criticisms. It exceeds expectations in all respects.

The anonymous Kid (Patel) makes a living by sparring for cash in a seedy underground fight club. His gimmick includes wearing a gorilla mask and agreeing to take the fall to his more popular opponents. After enduring bloody beatings for years while carrying with him a terrible childhood trauma, Kid’s rage has grown to astronomical levels. When he discovers a way to infiltrate the city’s elaborate network of corrupt leaders who are responsible for his mother’s death, Kid makes it his personal mission to exact revenge. In the process, he becomes a savior of the people, an underdog who helps the powerless settle the score and right the wrongs that they’ve all endured at the hands of the elite.

It’s a simple story that works well for a revenge film, as Kid has a great motivation for unleashing his violent retribution. This makes him a hero you want to root for. He’s a murderer, but the people he kills most certainly had it coming. Patel (along with co-writers Paul Angunawela and John Collee) include culturally-appropriate thematic elements that make a statement on the current political climate in India, which lends a depth to the story that makes it as meaningful as it is entertaining.

Heavily influenced by “The Raid,” “John Wick,” and Korean cinema, eagle-eyed viewers will catch many references and homages to these films. Thankfully, Patel’s approach doesn’t feel like a sad imitation of similar revenge action movies. The production values are fantastic, and every element falls into place. Patel has a great visual style that feels like he’s approaching his direction as a fan who understands the language of cinema (particularly action). There is some really creative stuff here, from the inventive kills to the exciting stunts.

The fight choreography is nothing short of excellent, and the realistic makeup and stunt coordination combine to make the hand-to-hand brawls feel so authentic The sets and creative duels are absolutely terrific, and fans of the genre will not be disappointed.

The film has its share of violent, bloody mayhem, but it’s not as action-packed as you may be led to believe. There is a lot of story, but it’s a strong one. The fighting doesn’t start until a good 40 minutes into the film, so it’s a good thing that the dramatic elements work so well (the narrative lags briefly about halfway through, however).

The biggest surprise to come out of the film is that Patel actually has the talent to back up everything he attempts, from the stunt work (which resulted in multiple personal injuries), writing, direction, and acting. Lanky and thin, he’s an atypical action star, but he sells it here as a scrappy yet powerful fighter who is dismissed as “a kid from the gutter.” You will cheer when Kid embarks on his savage rampage of revenge, especially when this nobody eventually becomes a somebody. Turns out, Patel is a badass action star with an undeniable charm, which makes for a magic combination.

“Monkey Man” strikes the right balance between meaningful political commentary and full-speed fun, and Patel does both equally well. Topped off with its stylish, gritty atmosphere and high-energy action, this is the type of film that will get you energized about the genre.

Chandler Danier,6.0,"Cool but somewhat sloppy, like the first half of this story doesn't need to happen. I'd have liked to see more of Monkey's journey to the city, or his establishment as kind slum overlord. More adventure than scenes of him getting beat up. How'd he build up to such an elaborate purse snatching? Seems more lucrative than his night job. Rigged, zero-stakes fights of our guy wearing a mask. I suppose it couldn't have been called Monkey Man without.

Engaging look into a side of India that seems to be ignored by many films. I liked the grit. Kept me engaged. Good scenes, unbelievable story elements. Our lead doesn't seem overly religious, his mission isn't one of a god fearing man...yet the focus of all the mother scenes is preaching the one true god.

CrazyJekyll,8.0,"Monkey Man might be thematically Incoherent, but it's action is just so insane and grimey that you can't help but enjoy the killer debut.

There is clear potential in Dev Patel's direction, he utilizes dynamic and powerful camera work without sacrificing too much clarity, and instills beauty and warmth besides all the rage, violence, and savage brutality of his fights. I also like how clear the character development is shown throughout this movie, by using both cinematography and choreography to showcase his growth from sloppy, anxious, and erratic kid to fast, slick, and stylish fighter.

You can really feel all of his sloppiness and mistakes in the first half of the movie with how sloppy and shaky the camera work is. It also has a lot of fast cuts between multiple people, and had constant use of blurry and bokeh shots.

But once the protagonist trains and heals in the 2nd half, (in a very sick montage btw) we now see much longer takes, much more stable and clear camera work, and has evolved himself into a more methodical, faster, and untouchable no-bullshit fighter who can destroy his opponents with one kick.

All of this is just so fucking fun to see, especially for a first time director. And despite a lot of it still needing more refinement, these flaws honestly just makes me more excited for his future projects. Because if this is Patel at his base form, just imagine what happens when he truly unlocks and polishes all of his techniques.

In summary, MONKEY MAN is a fucking fun protagonist driven action flick with insane, bloody, and entertaining fight scenes.",2025-06-16T14:18:56.902Z,560016,4 stars,0.6162476539611816

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Novice ""Margaret"" (Nell Tiger Free) arrives in Rome to a welcome from her cardinal sponsor ""Lawrence"" (Bill Nighy) where she hopes to complete taking her vows. She is greeted with open arms and taken on a tour of what she hopes will become her new home. This is when she encounters the shy ""Carlita"" (Nicole Sorace) who spends much of her time in solitude drawing. This intrigues ""Margaret"" but not as much as some of the other goings on in the maternity ward of the hospital. Her concerns are only exacerbated by a meeting with ""Fr. Brennan"" (Ralph Ineson) who spins her an horrific yarn that makes her head spin and sets her on a detection task that reveals a conspiracy to end all conspiracies - one that is conceived by the church for it's own perpetuation, but that could bring down both it and mankind. At times it's quite a decently paced watch, this, with a little gruesomeness (isn't it odd that the tools of medicine so often look like those of torture?) but given we have known the denouement since 1976 the lack of any real jeopardy does rather rob the film of much of a sense of menace and what ""jump moments"" there are are all a bit predictable. Free does try to imbue her character with a bit of passion, and she manages along well enough but Nighy is weak and the single appearance from Charles Dance adds nothing at all to these lacklustre proceedings. Prequels are always hard to deliver. This tries, but sadly we've seen it all before and I fear the nun theme is beginning to self-flagellate itself to death.

MovieGuys,6.0,"The First Omen, like so many latter day spin offs, of well respected franchises, fails to understand what made the original films so successful. 

I well remember the original Omen film and how it held me. Its intricate story, which chillingly displaced a sense of normalcy with a ever growing  horror and otherworldly menace, was truly compelling. 

By contrast. The First Omen lacks true progression and originality. For well over half the film, it is, in fact, rather dull. It does make vain attempts to utilises tropes and events of the earlier films but fails to develop a measurably meaningful, original narrative, to accompany them. Moreover, as other reviewers have stated, quite correctly, in my view, its safe ending does little to mitigate the overriding sense of cinematic malaise.

In summary, if you have never experienced the Omen franchise, don't start with this film. The original films are horror masterpieces, well worth your time. By contrast, this film will, I suspect, be remembered as a minor footnote with Omen fans, like myself and that's if its lucky.",2024-06-04T21:32:59.090Z,437342,3 stars,0.5607743859291077

TheSceneSnobs,2.0,"This movie was ultimately pointless. While it featured some cool visuals and interesting death scenes, it was overall very boring and failed to add anything significant to the lore of the franchise.

The film does have moments of visual flair, with certain scenes showcasing impressive special effects and creative cinematography. A major issue with the film is the way it handles its female characters. The writing falls into condescending tropes that undermine the potential for strong storytelling. Female characters are often depicted in stereotypical roles, diminishing their complexity and impact on the plot. 

Additionally, the film attempts to delve into the Christian-based horror sub-genre, specifically exorcism themes, but falls short of creating genuine scares. Studios often struggle with making these films truly terrifying because they lack a deep understanding of the faith’s principles. The result is a portrayal that feels hollow and inauthentic.

One solution could be to hire screenwriters who are well-versed in Christian theology and culture to bring authenticity to the sub-genre. Marketing these films to a Christian audience might also prove interesting and create a more engaged viewer base. Authenticity in storytelling could transform the genre, making it more impactful and frightening. 

As someone who does not identify as Christian, I can see the potential for more meaningful and scary films within this sub-genre if approached with respect and depth. The current approach, however, leaves much to be desired and feels disconnected from the true essence of the faith it seeks to portray.

Overall, while the movie offers some interesting visuals and death scenes, it ultimately fails to deliver a compelling or original story. The condescending portrayal of women and the hollow execution of Christian-based horror elements significantly detract from its potential. Studios need to rethink their approach to both character writing and genre-specific storytelling to create more engaging and authentic films.",2024-07-09T15:00:51.382Z,437342,2 stars,0.7526246905326843

GenerationofSwine,1.0,"I really don't see the point of making a prequel that retcons the original films.  Hollywood does it all the time, and when you hear the creators it is always to own the fans in some way.  As in: ""this will anger the fans of the original"" 

I don't understand how they think it's a good idea given that the fans are the reason the movies are worth making sequels, prequels, and reboots of.

So they seem to intentionally NOT want the fans to see it, and then are always angered when the movies fail.

But sometimes it's because Hollywood hires people who proudly didn't see the source material and then don't require them to watch the source material.

In either case they always seem shocked when the movie fails.

I read the plot and... didn't see it until fate made me, and the reason I didn't see it is because they outright said what they retconed.  

I'm not sure if it failed or not, but watching through it I couldn't help but think ""Why rewrite the Omen?

kevin2019,7.0,"""The First Omen"" approaches the whole franchise in much the same way as George Lucas did with his ""Star Wars"" prequels (1999-2005). Lucas took some ideas which had only been hinted at in the dialogue and then he simply expanded upon them. The ""Omen"" film which emerges here using this same method has been superbly directed by Arkasha Stevenson and it does manage to create a particularly threatening atmosphere which is allowed to subtly develop from the very beginning and then it gradually comes to the forefront and eventually permeates everything by the end. The idea of a sinister conclave existing within the church  and working its own agenda is a magnificent concept and it has been marvellously used here with deeply disturbing results. However, it is somewhat unfortunate this film also resembles ""To The Devil A Daughter"" (1976) at least in the beginning. This realisation hits home almost as soon as Margaret makes her first appearance on screen and the moment of revelation which comes much later on has no real impact at all because of it.",2024-12-26T01:32:55.985Z,437342,4 stars,0.43401074409484863

""Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is a “more” version of the previous installment. More Hollow Earth, more Titans, more gloriously giant fights filled with fantastic visual effects… and much more nonsense too.

Through an openly absurd narrative, Adam Wingard takes the charm and chemistry of his cast to help focus the film’s main spotlight on the titanic protagonists, Godzilla and Kong, delivering two hours of pure, unadulterated entertainment.

It won’t convert the most skeptical, but it will certainly solidify the unashamed passion of MonsterVerse fans.""

CinemaSerf,6.0,"It has to get at least three stars because it's got Dan Stevens (and his piercing eyes) in it. Otherwise, this is an entirely derivative and predictable effort that leaves nothing at all to our imagination. A truce has broken out since the last time (2021), with ""Kong"" ruling the roost deep in ""Hollow Earth""; ""Godzilla"" curled up asleep in the Coliseum and ""Ilene"" (Rebecca Hall) and the troubled ""Jia"" (Kaylee Hottle) keeping an eye on things for ""Monarch"" and mankind. ""Kong"" has a bad tooth so he comes to the humans for help. Fortunately, ""Trapper"" (the aforementioned DS) is a dab hand at grand-scale dentistry but it's while the ape is topside that alarm bells go off. ""Godzilla"" starts marauding again and an undiscovered vortex in the nether world requires investigation by ""Kong"" and his human pals. With ""Bernie"" (Brian Tyree Henry) back in the gang, off they all go to discover that a new menace has arrived, destroyed their monitoring outpost and it is now setting up a battle royal with just about every Titan left on Earth - above or below. Adam Winyard does just about everything on this film, and that shows in a complete lack of objectivity when evaluating this third rate adventure, the banal writing and equally lacklustre acting. It's as plain as the nose on your face why ""Godzilla' - who doesn't feature so much in this - is collecting energy, and when we do eventually get to them, the combat scenes are repetitive and too tightly choreographed. The scale is all over the place too. At times ""Kong"" appears the size of an house, at others he's more like a mouse. The visual effects are put to good use, but Hall just underwhelms, Henry talks way too much and Stevens' busky humour just doesn't hit home at all. I know it's difficult to keep coming up with new ideas for this genre and it must be difficult for the actors to constantly engage with nothing but some greenscreen, but the story is thin and the film reminds you of just about everything from ""Jurassic Park"" to episodes of ""Stargate"".

r96sk,5.0,"A whole load of nothing!

<em>'Godzilla × Kong: The New Empire'</em> is not a good movie, in my opinion anyway. It is similar to its predecessor in that sense at least, this is a minute improvement on that 2021 entry mind. It's basically a Kong film though, Godzilla goes missing for large periods. There is less human to be found onscreen which is good to see, but what's added in its place with Kong is just so dull to me.

The needless humanising of Kong continues, though this time it's actually done in and around the other monsters because... well, actually I'm not sure why monsters are acting human-like to each other but, eh, the movie, I guess. That Suko young ape character is particularly annoying too, it sounded like a clown horn and looks more belonging to that one Coldplay music video.

The whole film feels like if <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/films/in/avatar-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/"" rel=""nofollow"">Avatar</a>'</em> and the <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/films/in/planet-of-the-apes-reboot-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/"" rel=""nofollow"">Planet of the Apes</a>'</em> reboots had a baby and that's not a positive. It felt watching that it was also taking bits and pieces from other films too, mind perhaps that's just me reaching? The best scene of it all features the two titular characters in Giza, their bits together in Hollow Earth are decent too but their opponents are incredibly lame.

Cast-wise, it's OK. Rebecca Hall and Kaylee Hottle are as fine as previously, Brian Tyree Henry is marginally improved and Dan Stevens is serviceable. None of the others are all that noteworthy to me, but that actually is a true plus for this production; last time out I wanted less humans and less humans is what we get here.

My review kinda reads as if I hate this 2024 release. I do not, there are far worse pictures out there of course. It's just a heap of disappointment. I guess I just want pure, turn-off-your-brain titan carnage from these flicks, which evidently is not what the Monsterverse is necessarily trying to do... that's probably on me.

Catching up on this franchise has made me want to even more check out the 'proper' Godzilla releases out of Japan, so there is that. As for these American ones, I like <em>'Kong: Skull Island'</em> at least...",2024-04-11T23:11:56.480Z,823464,2 stars,0.5355961322784424

The eye candy aspect of this monster action flick is well done. In fact, its flawless and whilst this might evoke ""ooohs and ahhhs"", on the big screen, there's a lot more to any film, than visuals. 

Unlike Godzilla minus One, this Hollywood affair fails to deliver beyond the superficial. Its back story, sprinkled with the usual woke fluff, is formulaic, unimaginative and frankly, a little lazy. 

The results a film whose elaborate exposition, holds you, for a time but equally, its effect quickly dissipates. A little over half way in, I became thoroughly bored and distracted.

Sejian,6.0,"It took me two attempts to get into Godzilla x Kong. The first 25 minutes of this movie are utterly boring. I've got no problem with human drama in movies like this when it's done right, or at least engaging. Monarch was engaging. For the main human characters here, this only ever gets engaging at the very end.

I'm beginning to think the problem here is that movies like this are no longer ""movies"", they're ""installments"". They don't feel like self-contained polished products anymore, they feel like filler episodes filled with smaller barely connected filler episodes. Godzilla x Kong is like the opening to Age of Ultron, except it's the majority of the movie. You just don't really feel grounded at all.

There's too much music. They try to recapture the ""magic"" of the intro and ending of Godzilla vs Kong but it fails spectacularly. It was cute there because the focus was on Kong and they didn't overdo it. Here the focus is on Trapper AKA NOT Kong AKA no one cares about Trapper because not giving the man a name is doing a stupid.

whitsbrain,4.0,"This is the weakest of the of the ""Monsterverse"" series of films to this point. The CGI is all-out cartoonish, and it makes it nearly impossible to care about what's going on. Nothing looks real and I'm sure the creators of these movies have given up trying to make anything photo realistic. Or maybe it's an intentional choice because moviegoers actually prefer it to be unrealistic. Perhaps CGI has morphed into its own thing and realism is no longer required. That's probably the case and what a sad evolution that is.

The final battle in Rio is so chaotic that even though buildings are being smashed by monster fighting, none of it has any weight, structurally or consequentially. The scale of the monsters on the surface is diminished by the lack of anything to judge their size by when they are in ""Hollow Earth"". It's a lot like the old **Godzilla vs. Megalon** film released back in 1973. Godzilla and Jet Jaguar battle Gigan and Megalon and the whole thing takes place in an open field. The size of the kaiju is completely lost by having the fight take place in this setting. Hollow Earth promotes the same kind of scale problems. It's also a mistake to make these huge beasts move with the agility they do in this movie.

The Hollow Earth concept is lame and seems like it's a way to allow for Kong to still be the king of something since Godzilla is the dominant Titan on the planet. The humans in this movie are disposable again and this is even more evident when comparing this film to the far superior **Godzilla Minus One**, not to mention the stakes raised in **Shin Godzilla**.

The lack of dialogue, either by an important cast member being deaf or due to a lot of monsters growling and grunting, probably allows the Monsterverse movies to sell well internationally. The necessity for dubs and subtitles is greatly reduced. _""You mean I don't have to read!?! Awesome!!!""_

It actually pains me to have to write an almost entirely negative review. As a reference, I own EVERY Godzilla movie on physical media and consider it to be my favorite film series. Many, many of them are silly B-movies and some of them I don't even like, but none of them seem as formulaic or as tossed off as **Godzilla X Kong**.",2024-06-16T14:08:39.675Z,823464,2 stars,0.5779450535774231
TheSceneSnobs,6.0,"The Monsterverse is headed in a fun direction with its 'Titans', more famously known as Godzilla and Kong. However, while the action and spectacle continue to impress, the human element of these movies has significantly declined with this latest installment.

My hope is that the great character-building seen in the Monarch series can catch up to the movies. The human characters in this movie feel underdeveloped and somewhat sidelined, which detracts from the overall narrative. 

Despite these shortcomings, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is an action-packed and fun addition to the Kaiju subgenre. The introduction of new Titans, Skar and Shimo, provides a fresh and exciting rivalry for our iconic heroes. Their dynamic interactions and epic battles are thrilling to watch. 

Adam Wingard's direction effectively channels the spirit of the Showa Era Godzilla films, blending it with an 80s aesthetic and a futuristic vibe. This stylistic choice creates a unique and visually appealing backdrop for the film. 

The film also explores themes of rivalry, survival, and the balance of power, although these are primarily conveyed through the Titans' interactions rather than the human characters. The tone is a mix of nostalgic homage and modern spectacle, aiming to please long-time fans and newcomers alike. For example, scenes where Godzilla and Kong reluctantly team up against a common foe evoke a sense of epic camaraderie and respect, reminiscent of classic monster team-ups.

Overall, while Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire excels in delivering thrilling action and visual spectacle, it falls short in human character development. The new Titans, Skar and Shimo, are exciting additions that enrich the kaiju universe. Adam Wingard's direction brings a nostalgic yet fresh aesthetic to the film. If future installments can balance the monster action with stronger human elements, the Monsterverse will continue to be a captivating franchise. This movie is a must-watch for fans of the genre, promising an entertaining and visually stunning experience.",2024-07-09T14:33:26.879Z,823464,3 stars,0.5500606894493103

He led his tribe into war against Godzilla once before, we are told, but they were defeated and now the Skar King is making yet another bid to reach the surface. The way all the parts of this story are gradually disclosed in a piecemeal fashion as the film unfolds leaves a good quota of mystery and intrigue for us to puzzle over and savour.

Ahmetaslan27,7.0,"This installment pits Godzilla and Kong against each other once again, only for them to realize they must unite against a greater threat to protect Hollow Earth. Like previous films in the franchise, it’s an undeniably fun ride—embracing its absurdity with a story so ridiculous you can’t help but enjoy it. There’s a strange intelligence in how it commits to its own nonsense, making the over-the-top spectacle work.

That said, why even include humans? The movie barely cares about them. Monsters rampage through Egypt, Brazil, and beyond, leaving destruction in their wake without consequence. Yes, it’s a monster movie, but the sheer disregard for human stakes borders on comical. Still, the simplicity works—this is pure, mythical creature combat at its finest.

Where the film truly excels is in its direction. The visuals, creature designs, and non-verbal storytelling elevate it beyond its predecessors. The director masterfully conveys emotion and narrative without heavy dialogue, making the monster interactions surprisingly compelling. The Hollow Earth concept is pure fantasy, but that’s part of the charm—it’s so far removed from reality that your brain just goes along for the ride.

Fans of Fast & Furious might understand the appeal: it’s big, dumb fun that thrives on spectacle. But Godzilla x Kong earns its absurdity more convincingly, thanks to its fantastical world. The Zack Snyder influence is clear, particularly in the epic, Justice League-esque visuals—though that’s not a bad thing.

Will this movie change your life? No. But if you’re here for jaw-dropping monster battles and stunning direction, it’s a wildly entertaining escape.",2025-07-02T17:29:38.583Z,823464,4 stars,0.6003690958023071

""Cecilia"" (Sydney Sweeney) is taken to a beautifully rustic convent where she is welcomed with open arms. Everyone says how pretty and blessed she is, and this rather flies in the face of her natural humility. Imagine her shock, then, when she is summoned to the cardinal (Giorgio Colangeli) and made to undergo some rather personal medical tests that reveal.... Well that'd be telling, and for a while Michael Mohan manage to sustain a little interest in just what is going on amidst the peace and quiet of this ancient sanctuary. Sadly, though, the story swiftly goes way off the rails and leaves us exposed to Sweeney's limited talents and an excess of hysteria that involves a chicken, a dimly lit catacomb and a dastardly plan that puts enormous strain on our increasingly inventive and resilient novice. As ""Yoda"" might have profoundly said, ""loads of screaming and ketchup do not an horror film make"" and after about half an hour here the writing is on the wall (perhaps the best place for it?) and my interest wained.

The run time does fly by, I kinda felt watching that there wasn't really a middle - just one long build-up to the main event at the end. Speaking of which, 'the' scene at the conclusion made me smirk, the problem is that it most certainly was not supposed to; Cecilia's screams immediately sounded like that ""<a href=""https://youtu.be/ee925OTFBCA?si=s8NzVt0U6AX4jEg5&t=13"" rel=""nofollow"">best cry ever</a>"" meme* to me, I couldn't help but smile, I'm sorry.

That impending doom is all delivered, frostily, too little and too late to rescue this entirely derivative two hours from the cinema doldrums. The original cast - Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts and Aykroyd really need to stop appearing to legitimise these sequels - they are not patch on the original and really do smell, strongly, of flogging the dead horse. I would recommend a cinema viewing, though - at least that makes the most of the visuals.

""GHOSTBUSTERS: FROZEN EMPIRE falls short of its predecessor, but the members of the classic and new cast inject enough energy, charm, and emotion to compensate for the narrative inconsistencies and pacing issues.

Mckenna Grace's remarkable performance carries the film, but putting all the narrative, thematic, and emotional weight on a single character generates inevitable problems.

It's unlikely to become the favorite installment for fans of the franchise, but it's still an adventure with enough entertainment to satisfy families around the world.""

MovieGuys,6.0,"Whilst not as awful as its 2016 counterpart, the latest instalment in the Ghost Busters franchise, is hardly noteworthy either.

Frozen Empire tries, in vain, to recapture the vibe of the first film from 1984. There's an earnest effort to re-establish the off the wall,  goofiness of the original. Even bringing in old cast members to help things along. Sadly the wry wit and humour that defined the old flick, not to mention the remarkably deep characterisations, is largely absent. 

What you are left with is empty mimicry that's none too inspiring, backed by a story and action that's not awful but really feels like its going through the motions. On the subject of the story, I will give kudos to the fact it is, at least, a little original and imaginative. 

Regrettably whilst this film is superficially watchable its also instantly forgettable, having none of the blockbuster potential found in the first film, way back when. That said and again, in fairness, society has moved on from Ghostbusters. Its unsophisticated by modern standards and is never going to be the kind of hit it was in simpler, cinematic times.

I think the final question then, is why keep trying? Is Hollywood really so bereft of new ideas, that reinventing the past is all it can aspire to?

In summary, tries to wring the last drop out of a well worn and frankly, worn out franchise, that's long since, had its day. Superficially watchable but also readily forgettable.",2024-04-02T03:12:49.037Z,967847,2 stars,0.4702148139476776
TheSceneSnobs,6.0,"I have seen both amazing and terrible Ghostbusters films in my lifetime, and this one falls somewhere in the middle. It doesn't reach the heights of the original, nor does it plummet to the lows of the less successful installments. I would rank this film slightly below Ghostbusters II. While it’s fun, it suffers from a messy story and too many characters.

The film's main issue lies in its sprawling narrative. With too many characters vying for attention, the story becomes a bit disjointed. For example, the original Ghostbusters worked so well because it focused on a tight-knit group of protagonists, allowing for rich character development and clear, coherent plot progression. In contrast, this film tries to juggle multiple subplots and character arcs, leading to a lack of focus.

While the movie has its enjoyable moments, the story feels scattered. Key plot points are often rushed or underdeveloped, leaving the audience wanting more depth and cohesion. For instance, a subplot involving a new character’s backstory is introduced but never fully explored, making their motivations and actions feel superficial. This scattered approach detracts from the overall narrative impact.

Despite these flaws, the film does have its charms. It’s a fun addition to the franchise and includes plenty of moments that fans will appreciate. The humor, special effects, and ghost-hunting sequences are all entertaining and Paul Rudd shines throughout.

However, it lacks the nostalgic appeal of Ghostbusters II. The second film, despite its own flaws, managed to capture the magic and charm of the original. This new installment doesn’t quite evoke the same feelings. It feels more like a modern reboot than a continuation of the beloved series. For example, the nods to the original films are present but often feel more like fan service than integral parts of the story.

While this latest Ghostbusters film is not without its faults, it is still a fun watch. It doesn’t quite capture the nostalgia or coherence of the earlier films, but it adds a new layer to the franchise that fans might enjoy catching on TV. It’s worth a watch for its entertainment value, even if it doesn’t fully live up to the legacy of its predecessors.",2024-07-09T15:44:28.591Z,967847,3 stars,0.7205729484558105
Brent Marchant,7.0,"How far are you willing to go in realizing your ambitions? Would you be willing to make big sacrifices? Associate with shady beings? Sell your soul? Those are among the possibilities raised in the latest hair-raising smart horror/comedy from the writing-directing duo of Cameron and Colin Cairnes. This documentary-style offering presents the supposedly lost recording (complete with allegedly never-before-seen found footage) of a 1970s late night talk show hosted by comedian/TV personality Jack Delroy (David Dastmalchian) whose goal is to unseat Johnny Carson’s eminently popular Tonight Show as the premier after-hours choice of viewing. Delroy’s Night Owls broadcast is modestly successful, but it never manages to win the late night ratings race, so he desperately looks for ways to nudge his program over the top. When he decides to host a Halloween show with an array of occult/paranormal guests – capitalizing on a growing trend at the time – he believes he’s hit on the formula to achieve his goal. But, as the show progresses, he finds himself in over his head as events begin to spiral out of control. Viewers both on and off the screen are kept in suspense with a well-integrated blend of humor, high camp and unexpectedly spooky moments involving a hammy, self-righteous psychic medium (Fayssal Bazzi), an egomanical magician-turned-debunker (Ian Bliss), and an escaped teenage cult member (Ingrid Torelli) and her psychologist caregiver/surrogate parent (Laura Gordon). As things deteriorate, Jack tries to hold the show together with the aid of his producer (Josh Quong Tart) and flunky sidekick (Rhys Auteri). But, as the stakes are continually upped, that task grows ever more difficult, especially when supernatural influences begin to assert themselves in the studio, threatening both the broadcast and the fulfillment of the host’s long-cherished dream. Although occasional pacing issues, a periodically disjointed narrative and a somewhat overblown final act can get in the way of the smoothness of the story flow, these shortcomings are made up for by the film’s superb period piece production design, its clever writing and its fine performances, most notably that of the protagonist. And, in the end, it’s all served up with lots of laughs and a tidy moral of the story. Admittedly, “Late Night with the Devil” probably would have worked better as a Halloween release than a piece of springtime movie fare, but that doesn’t lessen the entertainment value of this inspired production, one thar shows horror flicks can indeed do more than just see how high it can make the final body count.",2024-03-26T12:48:39.472Z,938614,3 stars,0.44581854343414307
CinemaSerf,6.0,"With his days of chasing Johnny Carson in the television ratings long gone, the now struggling and recently bereaved talk show host ""Jack Delroy"" (David Dastmalchian) is staring cancellation in the face. Then he and producer ""Leo"" (Josh Quong Tart) come up with an idea for a riveting Halloween special. The gist of what comes now purports to be an off-air recording of that lost transmission from 1977 - and it's quite literally hair raising. His first guest is a medium, his second an out-and-out sceptic and his third - well they have quite an unique claim to fame - and it's this last quarter of the film that comes ""alive"". Sadly, the rest of this feature is rather hampered by the constant (virtual) advertising breaks that completely suck the pace out of the thing. They are designed to, in monochrome, fill in a little of the back-stage machinations as the programme goes to air but for me, they just interrupted - far too frequently - the culmination of the truth or fake storyline. Dastmalchian does an half decent job here, but the plaudits really belong to Ian Bliss and his sarcastic ""Carmichael Haig"" character. He's the poacher-cum-gamekeeper cynic who has a ridiculing put down for just about everything that emanates from the other characters. Projectile vomiting or chair levitation - he has an plausible explanation. That's maybe part of the film's problem in general. Though set in the 1970s when these kind of visual effects were less prevalent, the whole thing just comes across as a perfectly plausible ratings-gathering gimmick. Whilst that's not necessarily a bad thing, it does rather rob the film of any pretence of horror or mystery. In fact, by the conclusion it seemed more designed to send up the whole principle of half-baked, late-night American television hosted by vain, ambitious but largely talentless men in suits. It's short and sweet, and doesn't hang around - but I just didn't find it particularly shocking or innovative. Wait til it's on the television, I'd say.",2024-03-27T11:01:09.408Z,938614,3 stars,0.4536360502243042

MovieGuys,8.0,"Late Night with the Devil demonstrates how much can be achieved with a quality script and exceptional acting.

First off the performance by  David Dastmalchian is simply excellent, in every sense. He beautifully and convincingly pulls off a Johnny Carson style, impression of a late night 70's interviewer. The man is wholly believable and to be honest, its his performance that drew me in and kept me watching till the end.

The story is well rendered too. Its not exceptional but there's a decent amount of originality and a sense of ambiguity, especially surrounding the main character to create intrigue and interest. Has the interviewer already made a shadowy pact with the devil? What price will he pay? Tune in, to see. 

On the down side there are obvious budgetary constraints in play. That said, but there is so much quality on offer here in terms of performances from the cast and a solid story, its really not overly noticeable.

TheSceneSnobs,8.0,"I love this movie. It is a brilliant dissection of ""testosterone movies"" in their most basic form. Typically, these films rely on a formulaic group dynamic to add depth to the stoic hero, as seen in the original. When the hero began to show emotion, another stoic figure was introduced to maintain the balance. In this reimagining, the tables have turned.

The surrounding cast of characters are formulaic stereotypes, including the dastardly villains. This approach cleverly mirrors the original's tactic but with a twist. For example, the antagonists follow the same pattern: once the main antagonist, Brandt, reveals any emotion, it is perceived as weakness, prompting the introduction of a more intense and hyper-masculine antagonist, Knox. This shift highlights the film's commentary on the traditional portrayal of strength and vulnerability.

The protagonist, Dalton, adds unexpected layers to the story. Unlike the typical stoic hero, Dalton displays mental health struggles and other vulnerabilities, making him a more complex and relatable character. He is constantly conflicted and fighting his inner demons, much like Knox, but he strives to control his wild and reckless tendencies. For example, Dalton's struggle with his darker impulses is poignantly depicted in scenes where he battles both external foes and his internal conflicts, showcasing his depth and humanity.

This modern-day Western with a twist offers a fresh perspective on the concepts of heroes and villains. By the end, the film delivers a new message that challenges traditional notions of heroism and villainy. The nuanced portrayal of Dalton's character and his journey towards self-acceptance and control provides a thought-provoking narrative. For instance, the climax where Dalton must confront his own nature and make a crucial decision encapsulates the film's theme of inner strength and redemption.

Overall, this movie stands out for its innovative take on a familiar genre. It successfully deconstructs the typical testosterone-fueled narrative by focusing on the protagonist's vulnerabilities and internal struggles. This fresh approach not only adds depth to the characters but also redefines the genre's conventions. I would love to see more stories told in this manner, offering new perspectives and challenging traditional narratives.",2024-07-09T16:02:12.838Z,359410,5 stars,0.5914551019668579
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,7.0,"Director Doug Liman’s “Road House” is a wild ride of fightin’, spittin’, cussin’, and bone snappin’, a testosterone-fueled muscle movie that’s perfect for a weekend stream. Taking a more dramatic angle with a drug and crime story, this re-imagining of the 80s cult classic still delivers plenty of action and entertainment, even if it lacks in originality and substance.

Trouble is brewing at a Florida Keys roadhouse, and proprieter Frankie (Jessica Williams) is desperate for some old fashioned law and order. The local police won’t help, so Frankie seeks out ex-UFC fighter Dalton (Jake Gyllenhaal) for the job. Down on his luck, he agrees to take the well paying gig in paradise. When he arrives, Dalton discovers that he’s stepped into a criminal underworld that’s darker and more serious than anticipated. One by one, he outsmarts and out muscles the seemingly endless line of bad guys that stand in his way.

The film works well because of its willingness to embrace its own over-the-top absurdity. Gyllenhaal plays Dalton with an authentic, rugged charm, taking his character seriously, but not overly so. He’s believable as a tough guy for hire who “hurts people for money,” and he lends a pedigree to an otherwise mindless piece of entertainment.

Conor McGregor is a lot of fun in his supporting role as Knox a worthy adversary to Dalton. Insane and unhinged, he feels like a ripoff of the Jason Momoa character Dante in “Fast X,” minus a bit of charm and acting talent.

The movie is over-the-top in a lot of ways, but the one thing that really bugged me is that early on, there’s a casual mention of a killer crocodile. This caused my mind to wander the whole movie, just waiting on the edge of my seat for Dalton to wrassle it (spoiler alert: I was so disappointed).

That’s not to say the movie isn’t corny, because it is. Those little touches of humor, the charismatic lead, brawny action sequences, and nods to classic muscle movies also make it wildly entertaining.

Let me put it this way: “Road House” ends with a clear set-up for a sequel that I wouldn’t necessarily be excited to see, but I’d definitely be first in line to buy a ticket.

TheSceneSnobs,1.0,"This movie features a cast of actors I generally enjoy watching, but it turned out to be a mess. The only standout performance came from John Cena, who fully committed to his character and brought some much-needed energy to the film.

The main characters are depicted as despicable human beings, treating everyone around them poorly. The film tries to justify the protagonist's behavior by revealing an abusive background late in the story. This revelation feels like a cheap excuse to garner sympathy and forgive his dishonesty and mistreatment of others. For instance, there is no prior indication of the protagonist's abusive past until it becomes convenient for the plot, making it feel forced and insincere.

The attempt to use child abuse as a justification for the protagonist's actions is poorly handled and comes off as classless. The film fails to provide a nuanced portrayal of how an abusive background might realistically affect someone's behavior. Instead, it uses the abuse as a plot device to excuse the protagonist's otherwise inexcusable actions. 

John Cena's performance is the movie's saving grace. He brings a level of commitment and charisma to his role that is noticeably absent in the rest of the cast. Cena's dedication to his character provides some genuine moments of entertainment in an otherwise disappointing film. 

The story and writing are weak, failing to create a cohesive and engaging narrative. The characters' actions often lack logical motivation, and the plot feels disjointed. The writers seem to believe that mentioning a character's traumatic past is enough to generate empathy, but without proper buildup and context, this tactic falls flat. The worst part is that it is astoundingly unfunny.

This film is a disappointment despite its talented cast. The poorly executed story, unlikable characters, and insincere attempts at emotional depth make it a difficult watch. John Cena's performance is a rare bright spot, but it isn't enough to save the film from its fundamental flaws. For a more successful movie, the writers would need to focus on creating believable character arcs and a more coherent narrative. As it stands, the film fails to deliver on its potential and leaves much to be desired.",2024-07-09T16:04:22.971Z,1022690,2 stars,0.7471387982368469
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,2.0,"“Ricky Stanicky” is a prime example of wasted potential, featuring stupid writing, unrealistic characters, and a barrage of unfunny jokes that fall flat. Directed by Peter Farrelly, this film squanders its promising premise and talented cast on a juvenile and uninspired, off-color comedy that fails to deliver enough laughs or entertainment to justify its sad existence. This is a really, really bad movie.

Twenty years after Dean (Zac Efron), JT (Andrew Santino), and Wes (Jermaine Fowler), three childhood best friends, created an imaginary scapegoat for their pranks and shenanigans, they still find themselves using the nonexistent Ricky Stanicky as an alibi for their immature behavior. After JT misses the birth of his first child due to yet another tall tale, their families get suspicious and demand to meet Mr. Stanicky. Panicked, the guys hired “Rock Hard” Rod (John Cena), a raunchy, washed-up celebrity impersonator from Atlantic City to bring their imaginary buddy to life. Rod takes his role far too seriously, which causes a lot of shenanigans to ensue, making the best friends wish they’d never created Ricky in the first place.

It sounds like a slam dunk of a premise that would lend itself to comedy gold, but Farrelly totally blows everything about his film. While it works as a childhood prank, it feels utterly ridiculous and implausible when applied to adult characters with families and responsibilities. These are grown men, for crying out loud.

Even worse, the film’s attempts at humor largely miss the mark, with most jokes and gags landing as total duds. Whether it’s the tired trope of bawdy rewrites of classic songs or the contrived scenarios involving Ricky Stanicky’s outrageous heroics, the comedy falls flat at every turn. Even the presence of a talented and charming cast can’t salvage the abysmal writing and lackluster execution.

Lou's father, played by Ed Harris is the town thug, and her sister is repeatedly abused by her creepy brother-in-law JJ (Dave Franco).

Another serious problem is the way they treat abuse victims. The very people who are defending her...later in the movie are beating her. This is our hero?

Kristen Stewart is a good actress, but Ed Harris is by far the best thing in the movie. The problem is that none of the characters become well fleshed out. None of them are worth hoping for. I don't need my characters I watch to be pleasant, but they need to show some kind of attributes that make them worth following from start until finish.",2024-05-01T15:43:42.608Z,948549,2 stars,0.6182070374488831

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,10.0,"I absolutely adored the bold and audacious “Love Lies Bleeding,” director Rose Glass’ sordid story of romance, violence, and redemption. Combining a lesbian love story with a brawny thriller, this gritty, bloody, and brash film was one of my favorites to come out of this year’s Sundance Film Festival.

Lou (Kristen Stewart), a reclusive gym worker who spends her days mopping floors, unclogging toilets, and laminating membership cards, is barely surviving her small-town existence. Her world transforms in an instant when the transient bodybuilder Jackie (Katy O’Brian) crosses her path. Lou falls hard for those rock hard muscles, and she invites Jackie to move in with her. Ambitious to a fault, Jackie begins training for a competition in Las Vegas (and starts injecting steroids at the encouragement of Lou). The plan is for the two to take an epic road trip out West, but a startling act of violence involving Lou’s sister (Jena Malone) and brother-in-law (Dave Franco) changes everything. The truth about Lou’s criminal family is revealed, further complicating not only her romance with Jackie, but pulling both women into a web of absolute mayhem.

Glass has created a film with a deliciously pulpy, crime thriller vibe. Her bold and distinctive style is reflected with a voice that practically screams with an underlying rage and intensity (and one of the best uses of magical realism I’ve ever seen in a movie). Lou and Jackie are flawed people, but you just can’t help rooting for their relationship. They are capable and guilty of some very, very bad things, but goddamn if these two aren’t meant for each other with their explosive love story for the ages.

Stewart and O’Brian deliver stunning performances, embodying their characters with a ferocious spirit that reflects the lust and desire of their tumultuous relationship. Their chemistry is palpable and intense, which lends an additional layer of authenticity to the story. The supporting cast is nothing short of terrific too, with effective turns from Anna Baryshnikov, Ed Harris, Franco, and Malone.

Passionate and provocative, “Love Lies Bleeding” is the type of film that gets under your skin. Beneath the violence and revenge, it’s a queer love story that’s hopelessly and breathlessly romantic.

thorian93,6.5,"Today I enjoyed: Damsel.

Damsel is a Netflix Original, that was released just a few days ago. Starring a strong cast with Millie Bobby Brown, Robin Wright, Angela Bassett and the voice of Shohreh Aghdashloo it follows the odyssey of Elodie. I am not going to spoil the plot for you, but I bet you can foresee most developments, dear reader.

Overall I have mixed feelings. The story is nothing new, most elements are well known for this kind of movie. Some decisions of characters (including the dragon) feel dumb, and sometimes our main character gets very lucky, so the rest of the plot can happen. The CGI ranges from poor to pretty good, poor more in the begging, with huge landscapes and castles, but later, when the dragon makes an appearance, it looks pretty decent. But I was watching on a rather small screen and Netflix is punishing me with mediocre quality for some time now. So take my visual rating with a grain of salt. Now one thing I will say about the dragon: It has an interesting spin to it. For one thing, half of the time, we do not really see it and only hear Shohreh Aghdashloo's deep, rasping voice, bringing it to life. And when we actually see the dragon, it has a slight horror touch if you will. It looks like a hybrid between your average majestic and broadly loved dragon and something more dark and slimy. A muskrat comes to mind. I liked that (sort of).

One remark towards the title: While it is obviously a play the well known 'Damsel in distress' and obviously Elodie fights instead of needing to be rescued, she screams a lot and actually seems in distress half of the film. Until she suddenly becomes the hero and single-handedly fights the dragon. It is a bit much and hard to believe.

This is in all honesty an average movie. It is neither terrible nor great. If you are in the mood for some imagery, gold and jewels, dragons, princesses, and a few swords, then go for it. There are worse ways to spend roughly 109 minutes. But there are also better ways.

Sejian,6.0,"Damsel suffers from the same issues that plague movies of this kind, and no, I'm not talking about the ""woke agenda"" or ""muh diversity"". I'm talking about bad writing. Too much reverse ""show, don't tell"" and too many contrived scenes and one-liners.

The CGI is good, the costumes and set designs are good, the overall plot is good, but the writing falters often.

I get that this is a PG-13 movie but teenage viewers aren't this dumb. Give them better writing. Maybe if we treat the younger generation like they have some intelligence, they'll start acting like it.

The end result is a movie that wastes its star power and the effort of all involved.

VAGUE SPOILERS AHEAD:

1. I get they were trying to do foreshadowing with the opening scene, but it ruined the ""reveal"". The birds were a nice thrilling scene that fell flat by us already being shown the antagonist.
2. The ""V"" hallucination was just too silly. Elodie should have found the _evidance_ and had her own organic ""Tis a lie!"" reaction.
3. It would have been nice to see Elodie wield a sword at some point before they left their kingdom, even if it was just her toting one in her introduction scene ""for wolves"" or some excuse. Take some hints from Brave (2012)'s Merida in the future for crying out loud.
4. Sister's reaction to stepmother's concern felt forced.
5. Stepmother's cut should have been a stab and she should have been in worse shape when she found Elodie. That scene also needed some work to make it less unbelievable. Like perhaps have Elodie make it back to the ship and find stepmother badly injured. Time skips are a thing that happens, y'know?
6. Father's reasons could have been better written. Easily they could've had palace guards shadow him to imply he'd been threatened and then redone his rescue attempt. Why? Because he is never shown to be callous to the needs or feelings of his daughters. Their family being threatened would've made more sense than ""well I thought the sacrifice was worth it for the good of 'OUR' people"". Why they had him say ""my"" is anyone's guess.
7. Less stoic one-liners and less stoic ""No! <*thrusts sword into ground*>"" moments. We've seen it numerous times and it's just utterly boring and contrived at this point.",2024-03-10T05:49:18.350Z,763215,2 stars,0.6299909949302673

""Damsel attempts to deliver a tale of empowerment and adventure within the rich fantasy genre but finds itself entangled in the ropes of predictability and missed opportunities for deeper narrative innovation.

Despite its shortcomings, the film shines through its technical prowess, from visually stunning effects to immersive world-building, and is anchored by Millie Bobby Brown’s compelling lead performance.

While it may not redefine its genre or leave an indelible mark on the history of cinema, it’s a pleasant home viewing with moments of genuine charm and resilience.""

The story is not tangled that you need to connect the dots from past, future and the now kind of movie. It's simple but super. CGI is amazing especially the dragon. Eat your heart out thorian93!

nicoleamaree,4.0,"**Movie Review: Damsel (2024)**

**Plot Overview:**
""Damsel"" is a fantasy film that subverts the classic 'damsel in distress' trope. Set in a medieval world, it follows Elodie, played by Millie Bobby Brown, who is tricked into a marriage with a prince only to find out she's to be sacrificed to a dragon as part of a centuries-old pact. The film takes a turn from fairy tale to survival as Elodie uses her wit and resources to escape her fate.

**Themes:**
The film explores themes of self-reliance, empowerment, and the subversion of traditional gender roles. It challenges the narrative of the passive female character, presenting a heroine who is capable and resourceful.

**Character Development:**
Elodie's character arc is central to the film's impact. She evolves from a young woman resigned to her fate to a fierce survivor, fighting not just for herself but for the future of her people. The supporting characters, including the prince and the queen, add depth to the story, each revealing their own motives and complexities.

**Director's Style:**
Juan Carlos Fresnadillo directs with a clear vision, blending action with fantasy elements. His use of contrasting settings – from the snowy village to the opulent royal court – adds to the film's visual appeal.

**Performances:**
Millie Bobby Brown delivers a strong performance, capturing Elodie's transformation convincingly. The supporting cast, including Ray Winstone and Robin Wright, provide solid performances, though Angela Bassett's talent is noted as underused.

**Technical Aspects:**
The film boasts impressive production design and costumes, creating a visually stunning medieval world. However, some reviews criticize the CGI as cheap-looking and the action sequences as repetitive.

**Strengths and Weaknesses:**
Strengths include the film's strong lead performance, innovative plot, and beautiful set pieces. Weaknesses lie in the script and some performances that fail to engage, along with technical aspects that could have been executed better.

**Recommendation:**
""Damsel"" is a film that offers a fresh take on the fantasy genre. While it has its flaws, the film's strengths make it worth watching for those interested in a modern twist on classic fairy tales.

In conclusion, ""Damsel"" is a bold attempt to redefine a genre steeped in tradition. It's a film that will resonate with audiences looking for strong female leads and a story that champions individual agency over destiny. Despite its shortcomings, ""Damsel"" is a commendable addition to the fantasy genre and is recommended for its unique perspective and engaging storyline.",2024-03-15T16:30:07.192Z,763215,3 stars,0.5605244040489197
r96sk,5.0,"A disappointment.

<em>'Damsel'</em> has the right ingredients but unfortunately fails to deliver. Millie Bobby Brown leads the cast in alright fashion, her performance in the lead role is serviceable. She is probably the only positive that I hold for this 2024 film sadly.

My main negative is the special effects, which are quite distracting throughout - barely any of it comes across as convincing. The dragon looks OK, but the way it moved sometimes didn't seem right. Speaking of that creature, Shohreh Aghdashloo is a neat piece of casting on paper, though her voice was not the most fitting in actuality. The lighting also felt odd.

On the cast, away from Brown, Robin Wright is very meh in her role, while Angela Bassett feels extremely wasted. There is, at least, a nice end credits song from the ace Lykke Li, ""Ring of Fire"" is admittedly incomparable to ""No Rest for the Wicked"" but it is pretty good all the same!",2024-04-06T23:29:45.004Z,763215,2 stars,0.6146688461303711

Per Gunnar Jonsson,8.0,"Although far from a masterpiece this is a simple, straightforward and entertaining fantasy movie.

The story is predictable to say the least but I do not really care. I rather have a good, solid but predictable story than one filled with the usual illogical twists that the Hollywood hacks are so good at coming up with.

Fantasy is about magic, fantastic creatures and thus about special effects. This movie is pretty solid in that area. The special effects are overall good, not fantastic but good. Occasionally the dragon fire looked a wee bit wonky but overall they were fine.

The movie moves at a decent pace. Not too fast and not too slow. The story and the past is revealed at a rate and in a way that makes things fit together nicely.

The main protagonist is quite right as well. The right amount of panic and cluelessness at the start which gradually turns into a capable and unafraid heroin seeking revenge.

It is also a story with a happy ending which I like. Well not for the evil queen of course but you cannot please everyone.

So, this was a pleasant surprise from Netflix. Their production has been a bit uneven to say the least but I guess the agenda pushers did not get their grubby hands on this one.",2024-06-15T16:53:58.219Z,763215,3 stars,0.49894675612449646
CinemaSerf,5.0,"Anyone remember an half-naked Tom Payne getting pulled into a barrel of hookers by Stellan Skarsgård in ""the Physician"" (2013)? That vision might just have forgiven this film had he featured a bit more, but clearly he had read the derivative script and decided it only merited one filming day - hence he hardly features at all. What does feature is the usual dysfunctional family malarkey with him newly married to the well-meaning animator ""Jessica"" (DeWanda Wise) who is trying to stay on friendly terms with his two daughters - the teenage ""Taylor"" (Taegen Burns) and the younger ""Alice"" (Pyper Braun). The family decide to move into her father's house - he is now in a care home - and quickly the youngest discovers a bear. Yep - a teddy bear. What can go wrong? Well it isn't a very nice bear, indeed it's distinctly malevolent and is soon trying to lure all of them (except Tom who has fled the proceedings by now) into a parallel reality with lots of rooms containing lots of scenarios. Some benign, so less so. Poor old ""Jess"" is soon at her wits end but fortunately neighbour ""Gloria"" (Betty Buckley) is on hand with some pearls of wisdom that might help them through this rapidly menacing quagmire! Or will they? This film plays out exactly as you would expect. There isn't an original bone in it's body, the acting is mediocre at best - but wait, it's nowhere near as banal as the extracts from the Janet & John book of horror film writing. Some of the dialogue here really does have you staring at the cinema ceiling in disbelief. It's another standard Blumhouse offering that passes the time without you having to engage your brain in the slightest - in fact, you could just watch the last ten minutes and miss very little from the rest of it.",2024-03-13T14:16:44.512Z,1125311,3 stars,0.43508532643318176
r96sk,5.0,"Pyper Braun merits praise, <em>'Imaginary'</em> otherwise falls flat.

I was never locked into the story and I didn't really care for the characters at any point, even Braun's Alice isn't all that interesting despite a rather great performance from the young actress. DeWanda Wise is a bit dull, while Tom Payne disappoints somewhat - I mean he only has a small role, sure, but his acting is unconvincing... and I know he can actor far better, as seen during his time on TV's <em>'<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)"" rel=""nofollow"">The Walking Dead</a>'</em>.

The antagonists in this are poorly utilized, the poster bear is prevalent but very boring. It needed a Chucky-esque portrayal, rather than the blank stare we get every few minutes. The ending also drags, I thought it was going to end sooner a few times but it kept finding new ways to stick around; nothing majorly grating, granted. The score is at least OK.

It also, amusingly, took me ages to work out what the bear's name was. I'm not familiar with the name ""Chauncey"", so genuinely for the longest time thought the name was either ""John C"" or ""Shaun C"". It was only when I finally noticed it written down visually that I realised! 😂

Luckily, though, the ""Chameleon"" has designs on obtaining all the powers from those now consigned to the nether realm and using the powers of Kung Fu to take over the world. ""Po"" has to be put his promotion on hold and along with his new-found, and useful, foxy friend ""Zhen"" try to thwart these heinous ambitions. Though there's plenty of action and self-deprecating dialogue the storyline really is too much of a recycled affair. Even the panda has been drawn into the multi-verse and to be frank, I'm a bit bored with that theme now - especially as it's never really accompanied by much in the way of jeopardy. Yes, this is an entirely predicable story that, in this case, misses out on the characterisations of his pals from the ""Furious Five"". It's watchable and the story well paced; there's some fun to be had in the wobbly, mountain-top, tavern but I think I've already forgotten most of it.",2024-03-29T08:44:08.063Z,1011985,3 stars,0.5825949907302856

Even after more than 10 years, I still miss the first Kung Fu Panda movie as it was genuinely a masterpiece. The story, action, dialogues, character building, the tension between Tai Lung and Shifu, everything was fabulous. Well, I can go on and on about the first Kung Fu Panda, but this is about this unbearable trash Kung Fu Panda 4.

This movie is so bad that calling it boring would be a compliment. Out of nowhere, this Zhen character manifests. All the formula film scenes replicated, unnecessary fights, moving around without any purpose, cracking jokes (painfully unfunny) out of nowhere, and so on. I wanted to leave the movie after 20 minutes but then I thought maybe something good would happen. However, I was wrong till the end. 

Pathetic direction, dialogue delivery and unfunny jokes started feeling irritating. No chemistry between Po and Zhen, and somehow they both are ready to die for each other. The Zhen character was uninteresting and annoying.

Just like contemporary movies where people get everything without any sacrifice or struggle, they managed to ""Mary Sue"" Zhen by making her the next dragon warrior.

I am glad that this movie ended this way. At least now I know I won’t be watching any more trash from this franchise.

If you loved the first Kung Fu panda, please stay away from this. Please save and cherish your good memories. You have been warned.

Dialog writers need to remove certain words from their joke book, like ""method"", as in method acting. When I hear method acting, I think Jared Leto. Associating Jared Leto's ""method acting"" with your movie probably isn't a good thing. Method acting and Jared Leto occupied real estate rent free for the entirety of this movie. It didn't help that they couldn't stop themselves from thinking ""it's so nice, we'll say it twice"".

The story is predictable, made worse by the spoon feeding. To add insult to injury, the back and forth between Po and Zhen up until the ""big stink"" is good enough to maybe throw you off if you haven't seen it a dozen times already or if they hadn't spelled it out.

I reckon I'll be saying the exact same thing in X amount of months about this one, that doesn't necessarily mean a film is bad though - because this release isn't. The voices we hear are perfectly satisfactory, from Jack Black to Awkwafina, Viola Davis (the best, away from lead) and the rest.

The music here is good. There is one piece of the score, which is heard a couple of times and during the end credits, that must be a homage of sorts to television show <em>'Dexter'</em> - weird connection granted, but it sounds practically exactly the same to me.

On the note of the sound, I enjoyed Tenacious D's rock cover of ""...Baby One More Time"". I listened to it an embarrassing amount when it first released alongside this movie, the video was admittedly part of the reason why - I'm always a fan of seeing film casts in music videos.

There's a decent story told, alongside nice animation. It'll no doubt be forgettable to me personally, but I can still acknowledge it as something that I deem passable.",2025-02-11T21:05:06.533Z,1011985,3 stars,0.5438809990882874
MovieGuys,4.0,"The first Code 8 movie, was never going to be an award winner but at least it had an element of danger, pacing and excitement. 

Regrettably, its sequel, seems to be more a vehicle for woke tropes than  an actual sci fi film. It appears to be mostly about people from diverse backgrounds being either abused by ""the system"" or co-opted into it, as state sponsored abusers. 

The results feels like what it is. A moral statement viewed from a particular point of view, rather than an exciting, sci fi film, which is what, in this reviewers opinion, it should have been. 

Its slow paced, not terribly exciting and really goes nowhere interesting but then, how could it?

""Dune: Part Two surpasses even the highest expectations, establishing itself as an unquestionable technical masterpiece of blockbuster filmmaking.

With a narrative that deepens the complex web of political relationships, power, faith, love, and destiny, it not only provides a breathtaking audiovisual spectacle, thanks to the genius of Denis Villeneuve, Greig Fraser, and Hans Zimmer, but it also offers a profound meditation on universal human themes through thematically rich world-building and thoroughly developed characters. The superb performances of the entire cast, led by a career-best Timothée Chalamet and a mesmerizing Zendaya, further elevate this incredibly immersive cinematic experience.

I enjoyed <em>'Dune'</em>, though remember thinking it was obviously a complete set-up to a sequel and that this would only improve upon its predecessor - and that's very much the case. <em>'Dune: Part Two'</em> is excellent! My interest did wane slightly at roughly the middle part, as was similarly the case with the first film in truth, but that was a feeling that only lasted for a relativiely short time.

All in all, it's fantastic. The acting is top notch, the visuals are breathtaking <em>(those sandworms tho)</em> and the score is outstandingly hefty - you can always rely on the great Hans Zimmer! Timothée Chalamet stars yet again, as do the likes of Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Dave Bautista & Co.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"This is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective, almost industrially sounding, audio - but what happened to the story? It's wafer thin and really stretched out for 2¾ hours. We pick up with ""Paul"" (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the ""Fremen"" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader ""Stilgar"" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give ""Jessica"" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son's ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on ""Chani"" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil ""Baron Harkonnen"" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsgård) has recruited his lethal nephew ""Feyd-Rautha"" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on ""Arrakis"" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of ""Khartoum"" (1966) and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) with a bit of the ""Phantom Menace"" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya's warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round. That said, it does work well enough as a classy and well produced sci-fi adventure with plenty of action and mysticism but I needed more meat on it's bones.

But it was not something extraordinary. The acting and direction were pretty average. There were a lot of editing mistakes. In some scenes, you feel like it was rushed. Some scenes feel like they are missing context. Some scenes are unnecessarily slow-paced.

There were a lot of stupid and logical fallacies. First, they show how dangerous those 'worms' are and run for life. Then they show you can actually 'tame' them like a cowboy, but with immense difficulty. Then you see the whole clan with tents, food, luggage, etc., riding them for traveling.

However, when the first part of this story was released in 2021, I was sorely disappointed by this tedious, overlong slog that, despite its stunning visuals and cinematography, never really engaged me. Though, for all my disappointment with the initial installment, it can’t begin to compare to my reaction to “Part Two” – an even more tedious, unengaging, overly complicated offering that had me bored by 20 minutes in. I found myself not caring a whit about the characters or their story (which could have used a scorecard to help viewers sort out everything), and even the supposedly superior visuals of this iteration failed to capture my attention or interest. I can only conclude that I must be missing something, given the generally positive reactions and accolades this film and its predecessor have received, but I’m mystified that I haven’t yet figured out what. By all rights, the elements would appear to be in place here to make this picture succeed – a stellar cast, great special effects and the skillful directing of filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, who created such excellent works as “Arrival” (2016) and “Blade Runner 2049” (2017) – but “Part Two,” like its predecessor, just never grabbed me. To be honest, I’m truly surprised that I made it all the way through, considering the nearly constant temptation to want to fast-forward through the egregiously dull sequences (of there were many). From all this, I can only surmise that this film and the one that preceded it were created simply to milk as much box office money as possible out of the source material, despite the fact that the story isn’t captivating enough to live up to that challenge. Indeed, if you’re like me and found the first part boring, you’ll probably find this one even more tiresome and lackluster (I’m certainly glad that I waited for this one to come to streaming and didn’t waste my money on theater ticket prices). And now, as I understand it, another sequel, “Dune: Messiah,” is in pre-production to continue a story that has still yet to reach conclusion after more than five hours of screentime. Be aware that the “Dune” films are far from the quality of other lengthy trilogies like the “Lord of the Rings” and “Dark Knight” series, films that definitely hold viewer interest from start to finish. Instead, “Dune” and “Dune: Part Two” are more like such mind-numbing stand-alone offerings as “Heaven’s Gate” (1980), “Ishtar” (1987) and “Tenet” (2020) than anything of a genuinely epic nature. Treat the hype for this one with a hefty grain of salt, and don’t say you weren’t warned.",2024-06-14T05:20:00.015Z,693134,2 stars,0.6209470629692078

""Dune"" is a franchise that demands prior knowledge of the backstory and characters from either the book series or previous adaptations to fully appreciate the intricate narrative. While the film is long and dialogue-heavy, it manages to deliver a compelling story despite the limited action sequences.

Timothée Chalamet shines in his role, though at times, his character may feel overshadowed by the ensemble cast. Florence Pugh's character, on the other hand, seems to lack a clear purpose, appearing intermittently throughout the film without a defined role.

Rebecca Ferguson delivers a standout performance as the mother figure, commanding attention whenever she appears on screen. The dynamic between Josh Brolin and Dave Bautista offers a humorous nod to their previous roles, adding an entertaining element to the movie.

Zendaya's character receives more screen time than in the previous installment, but her role remains secondary to the overarching plot. Austin Butler's portrayal, while intriguing, is hindered by sparse dialogue and an unusual vocal delivery reminiscent of an ""evil Elvis.""

As a middle installment in a trilogy, ""Dune Part 2"" serves as a foundation for character development and plot progression. While it may not be as action-packed as some viewers expect, it sets the stage for the anticipated climax in the final film of the series.

Overall, ""Dune Part 2"" is a worthwhile watch for those invested in the franchise, offering a rich and immersive cinematic experience. With the promise of a third installment on the horizon, the intricate world of ""Dune"" is poised to deliver a satisfying conclusion to the story.",2024-09-03T02:14:40.925Z,693134,3 stars,0.4860590994358063

CinemaSerf,7.0,"""Edith"" (Olivia Colman) is the daughter of the respectable ""Swan"" family who live a God-fearing life under the aegis of father ""Edward"" (Timothy Spall) and mother ""Victoria"" (Gemma Jones). A letter arrives and they gather round the table in trepidation. This isn't the first such letter and it causes dad to head straight to the police station to demand that they arrest their new next door neighbour. She's quite a contrast to the ""Swan"" prim and proper existence. ""Rose"" (Jessie Buckley) is a fairly foul mouthed single parent who calls a spade a spade and after befriending ""Edith"" initially, seems to have earned her enmity. It's not just ""Edith"", though - most of this community of small-minded hypocrites take the same view and with jail looking increasingly likely, she needs help! Now that comes from the most unlikely of quarters as a few of the villagers, and disgruntled woman police officer ""Moss"" (Anjana Vasan) decide that this is all just too convenient, and that they are going to find out who really did write these heinous and obnoxious letters - a task worthy of ""Miss Marple"" herself... I found it pretty easy to guess who the culprit was, but the knowing doesn't really impact on this rather joyous romp through a society of double standards and bigotry. The language is ripe but even when at it's most objectionable, it's always quite funny to think what genuinely might have shocked a generation of bible-bashers and bridge-players. There's quite a fun sub-plot with Dame Eileen Atkins, Joanna Scanlan and Lolly Adefope to help keep the mischief rolling along nicely, the police force are well represented in the haplessness stakes by Hugh Skinner and Paul Chahidi and, oh - of course ""Rose"" has a black boyfriend ""Bill"" (Malachi Kirby) just to further antagonise her less than worldly brethren.

Brent Marchant,8.0,"Just about everyone loves a good mystery, but, in the case of director Thea Sharrock’s latest, viewers are treated to one that’s both intriguing and utterly hilarious. Based on a true story, this delightfully offbeat offering tells the head-scratching tale of a small seaside community in 1920s England in which residents begin receiving anonymously sent letters filled with graphic profanity of a highly colorful and creative nature. The chief suspect is a recently arrived salty-tongued Irish immigrant (Jessie Buckley) who never hesitates to speak her mind or act out when she thinks it appropriate. The primary recipient is her neighbor, a cheery but conservative Christian woman (Olivia Colman), a prim and proper spinster who lives with her stern, judgmental father (Timothy Spall) and elderly, faint-of-heart mother (Gemma Jones). But is the accused really at fault? When a plucky, resourceful policewoman (Anjana Vasan) who’s supposed to stay out of the investigation gets involved, she uncovers evidence that circumstances may not be what they seem. The result is a sidesplitting thriller with loads of twists, turns and misdirections, a clever, original and outrageously waggish release that will tickle the funny bone of anyone who appreciates the wit and wisdom of good, old-fashioned, foul-mouthed cursing (sensitive viewers take note). The positively superb ensemble cast is outstanding across the board, particularly among the aforementioned principals, as well as a host of flamboyant supporting players. It’s obvious that everyone involved in this production had to have had fun making this film, and it shines through loud and clear in the finished product. There are a few sequences where the pacing drags slightly, but who cares? “Wicked Little Letters” is such a good time watch that you won’t really care. What’s perhaps most intriguing, though, is that this is a fact-based story – one that garnered national attention at the time – that had largely been lost to time but that, thankfully, has been brought back to life through this deliciously devious indie gem.

Brent Marchant,6.0,"From time to time, a movie comes along that’s hard to define, and, hence, it’s hard to know what to make of it. Such is the case with the second feature outing from filmmaker Johan Renck, a director best known for TV commercials and music videos, a reputation that bleeds through at times in this production. Viewer opinions and interpretations of this one are all across the board, making “Spaceman” one of the most challenging releases to peg in recent memory. This space-faring sci-fi release tells the tale of an astronaut (Adam Sandler) on a solo, long-term deep space mission to investigate a mysterious anomaly. However, he’s experiencing a profound sense of loneliness that’s distracting him from carrying out his quest, in large part because of marital troubles with his pregnant wife (Carey Mulligan) back on earth. As he seeks to sort out these matters, though, he’s further sidetracked by the unexpected appearance of an enigmatic alien that resembles a large nimble spider (voiced by Paul Dano) who possesses a profound philosophical wisdom. But how will all of this shake out, and what effect will it have on the mission? This scenario makes for an intriguing premise, but what exactly is the filmmaker’s intent in carrying it out? There are mixed tonal aspects here, some of which seem sincere, with others that come across as cheeky and cheesy, as if the director is giving the audience a good, sidelong wink. Indeed, it’s often difficult to tell which way the narrative is supposed to go. And, if straddling the fence is the real intent, it doesn’t quite work. So where does that leave us? I suppose it’s up to viewers to decide for themselves, but that seems shamelessly noncommittal. Based on the film’s attributes alone, there are good arguments for and against this offering. For instance, its ample metaphysical and philosophical insights are cogently presented and easy to understand, even if a bit saccharinely encrusted at times. It also represents a promising step up for Sandler’s attempt at reinventing himself as an actor in search of more substantive roles than the inanely silly parts he’s best known for. And the picture’s numerous deftly placed allusions to other sci-fi/fantasy projects enhance the narrative nicely, as seen in homages to “Interstellar” (2014), “Solaris” (2002), “Everything Everywhere All at Once” (2022) and even the lyrics to David Bowie’s Space Oddity. However, tedious pacing, occasionally poor sound quality and less-than-stellar visual effects (especially in the alien’s supremely tacky appearance) get in the way, further adding to the inherent overall ambiguity noted earlier. This one is thus up to you – and don’t be surprised if you come away from it with a different interpretation than what’s written here.",2024-03-02T04:38:44.375Z,636706,4 stars,0.4320477545261383
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,5.0,"In director Johan Renck’s science fiction fantasy “Spaceman,” adapted from Jaroslav Kalfař’s 2017 novel Spaceman of Bohemia, viewers are taken on a philosophical journey into the depths of one man’s self-inflicted loneliness that manifests as a nightmarish friendship with a giant space spider. It takes a lot of guts to attempt a screen adaptation of such an abstract story, but Renck pulls it off, mostly with the help of a strong lead performance from Adam Sandler.

Dubbed “the loneliest man in the world,” Jakub (Sandler) is six months into a solitary mission to investigate a mysterious phenomenon that lies on the edge of the solar system. Realizing the wife (Carey Mulligan) and marriage he left behind will likely not be there waiting upon his return, his desperation to repair the relationship grows. One day, Jakub discovers a giant alien spider he calls Hanuš (voice of Paul Dano) hiding in the ship. With the new companion on board, he develops an unlikely kinship and intense emotional bond with the creature.

This is a story about two lonely travelers who find comfort in each other. They share deeply profound conversations about the nature and meaning of life, love, death, and the sting of regret and grief that can overpower a person’s existence. Jakub’s ambition has destroyed his life and his relationship, and his grip on reality is drifting away (there possibility is left open for viewers to decide if Hanuš is imaginary or indeed real). The spider can somehow read Jakub’s mind and access his life’s memories, and there’s a lot of hurt and emotional turmoil that’s been building up for decades. It’s a story of what it means to be human, but also one of companionship and mutual understanding.

The effects crew did a bang-up job animating Hanuš, and the spider looks and feels real both physically (with his glossy eyes and hairy body) and emotionally (thanks to a moving voice performance from Dano). The spider is authentic with sympathy and companionship, and the friendship that develops between Hanuš and Jakub, whom he affectionately calls “skinny human,” is genuine. Sandler is an accomplished dramatic actor (something that’s easy to forget), and he is absolutely great here, depicting a tormented soul that’s well-worn with loneliness.

Pensive and poignant, “Spaceman” isn’t going to be for everyone. There’s no denying that it’s a very weird film, but there is an abundance of thoughtful reflection about the struggle with confronting loneliness that’s told in a highly creative way.

Joey Slotnick and CJ Wilson try their best as the goons but otherwise this is a thinly stretched comedy that relies far too much on the supposed shocks or comedy from it's lesbian theme and nowhere near enough on any degree of originality with the script. It vacillates between the dull and crass, and neither Domingo nor Matt Damon make anything like enough of a contribution to make much difference to the well travelled path the story takes.

I had a pleasant enough time viewing <em>'Bob Marley: One Love'</em>, though it does kinda seem a bit hollow post-watch - as in I don't feel like I've learned much nor actually seen that much, the movie has like three noteworthy events but then that's kinda it. The music from those involved also didn't feel amazingly utilised, I guess they didn't want it to be too jukebox-y.

Kingsley Ben-Adir does well in the lead role as Bob Marley himself. I'm not a Marley superfan or anything close, I basically only know his biggest hits, but the resemblance of Ben-Adir seemed off to me - a thought that was only solidified when the real Marley appears via archive footage at the end. Perhaps that's just me, though.

Lashana Lynch gives a good performance, spearheading the rest of the cast who are alright; interesting to see James Norton, Michael Gandolfini too... even if I didn't realise it was Gandolfini until the credits.

We get little by way of establishment. Why is he revered on his home island of Jamaica at the start? We are plonked into the centre of a political hotbed and then all to briefly, bullets are flying and we are in London, his family in Delaware. Again, little meat on the bones of context there for us to understand just what was going on and why he was so important to both sides in that conflict - alive or dead. The last twenty minutes does allow for more of his musical talents to shine, and KBA delivers them enthusiastically and engagingly, but somehow I just felt this was the thinnest of coats about his enigma. James Norton just looked like he was along because he liked the music and Lashana Lynch is totally unremarkable too. Son Ziggy may well have had a hand in this, but it really under-delivers on a story that I thought should have been a no-brainer politically, musically and culturally.

""Bob Marley: One Love navigates the intricacies of biographical storytelling with mixed success. Its commendable focus on Marley’s message and music, coupled with good performances, highlights the enduring relevance of his legacy.

However, the reluctance to engage with the more contentious aspects of his life and the oversimplification of his political contributions undermine the potential for a more nuanced, complete exploration.

While the movie serves as a vibrant homage to Marley’s spirit and artistry, it ultimately leaves me yearning for a deeper, more critical study of the complexities that defined one of the most influential artists of the 20th century.""

Brent Marchant,5.0,"In addition to telling an individual’s life story, one of the other primary objectives of a film biography is to provide insight into the protagonist’s character and nature. Unfortunately, that’s where this profile of reggae icon Bob Marley (Kingsley Ben-Adir) tends to come up somewhat short. Director Reinaldo Marcus Green’s biopic about the legendary musician and peace advocate provides viewers with a somewhat scattershot and episodic look at the artist’s life, primarily focused on the last few years of his life, intercut with flashbacks that are largely inserted without explanation and don’t come across as especially insightful or enlightening. To the film’s credit, it features a fine repertoire of Marley’s music, including the origins of many of his works, as well as fine performances by Ben-Adir and Lashana Lynch as the musician’s wife, Rita. However, I came away from this offering feeling as though I didn’t know a lot more about its subject than I did going in, particularly since many story threads are raised but never sufficiently resolved. It also probably didn’t help that the film’s sound quality (in the non-musical sequences) left much to be desired, often resulting in the need to strain to hear and comprehend the dialogue. In many ways, “One Love” feels like a missed opportunity to tell the story of someone who had much to say but whose message doesn’t come across nearly as clearly as it could and should have. Listen to Marley’s music instead – you’ll get more out of one of his albums than you’re likely to absorb from this picture.",2024-04-29T08:10:58.471Z,802219,3 stars,0.537064790725708
CinemaSerf,5.0,"We start off with an heavily pregnant woman deep in the Peruvian jungle looking for a very rare spider with her pal ""Ezekiel"" (Tahar Rahim). Guess what? Yep - she finds it, and almost immediately too!

Advance twenty-odd years and we meet paramedic ""Cassie"" (Dakota Johnson) who drives around with her partner ""Ben"" (Adam Scott), indifferently saving folks from disaster.

A trip on a train to a funeral proves decisive as three of the other passengers also feature in her dreams - all being the targets of a mysterious lycra-clad tunnel-climber bent on slaughter. Can she rescue them and find out just what's going on? Well possibly, but the story is just thin and the characters so undercooked that I didn't really care. The whole arachnid story line is under-developed to the point that I couldn't see what her skills really had to do with a spider at all. Tahar Rahim seemed uncertain if he was supposed to be ""Deadpool"" and/or Antonio Banderas and hats have to come off to Celeste O'Connor for playing the entirely obnoxious and attitudinal ""Mattie"" with quite such aplomb. The denouement is straight out of ""Highlander"" (1986) and I'm afraid that rather summed this up. Not an original bone in it's small and squidgy body, over-scripted and made for the sake of it. Sure, it's all about team bonding, trust and finding yourself (quite literally), but the readiness with which all concerned buy into this increasingly repetitive and whacky scenario is just daft. Like the whole multi-verse concept, the studios have decided to take super-hero films and flog them to death without worrying about concept, character or a decent story, and though Johnson does try to lift this where she can, it's ends up being something akin to one of those ""Superman"" television episodes we used to watch with Dean Cain - only with monotonous time-shifting!",2024-02-15T10:07:26.665Z,634492,2 stars,0.47610408067703247

I don't know what to say, I found it to be suitably entertaining.

I don't care, it gave me enough enjoyment that I wasn't questioning anything about what I was watching.

The cast are probably the key factors as to why I did enjoy this. I previously knew of Dakota Johnson but hadn't actually seen her in anything properly, I found her performance to be more than noteworthy and she spearheads the film strongly. The trio of Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor are positives too.

Tahar Rahim's antagonist, meanwhile, is poorly written and portrayed, though I personally thought the actor did a good job. I have no complaints with anyone who appears onscreen to be honest. Away from them, the pacing and score are also standouts.

In my recollection of viewing this, I truthfully haven't got any issues with it. If it wasn't for the slight bad murmurs that I did hear about pre-watch (though not much of it as I avoid as much as I can with movies) and the reaction on sites like this post-watch, I'd not be questioning my thoughts about this whatsoever.

In short, I came away enjoying it and unhappy with how this movie was portrayed in the movie-review media. I think it was just a piling on of the mob-mentality reviewers who tried to kick somebody who was already down, but anyway, I do hope this gets a sequel and I do hope the filmmakers continue with the campy, unintentionally funny, very quiet scenes with no theme music whatsoever style, low-budget-but-still-decent CGI, and over-all enjoyable moviemaking which can be watched and enjoyed for an hour and a half.

JPV852,4.0,"Is Madame Web the worst superhero movie ever made? Not by a longshot as Superman IV, Batman & Robin and Supergirl would take a front seat in that department. Now the argument can be made it's the worst in the modern era of superhero movies, though personally it's ""better"" than Suicide Squad but even that one had costumed heroes in it versus MW which only had maybe a few minutes of the ladies in their costumes and even then, it's via future visions.

Beyond that, nothing really works. The direction, even with the twisty-turny camera movements felt familiar as I'm pretty sure I've seen it done before but minimally. The performances from everyone was either bland, Dakota Johnson especially, or downright awful (Tahar Rahim), not helped by the stilted and oft atrocious dialogue from no less than four writers, two of which were responsible for Morbius.

I didn't hate Madame Web more so that I found it downright dull and boring. There's no reason to watch this and with the terrible box office, the last line of ""And you know the best thing about the future?

We come to this place... for magic.
We come to the theater to laugh, to cry, to care.
Because we need that, all of us:
that indescribable feeling we get when the lights begin to dim,
and we go somewhere we've never been before;
not just entertained, but somehow reborn.... together.
Dazzling images, on a huge silver screen.
Sound that I can feel.
Somehow, heartbreak feels good in a place like this.
Our heroes feel like the best part of us,
and stories feel perfect and powerful.

misubisu,1.0,"## **Madame Web (2024) Review: A Catastrophic Failure on Every Conceivable Level - 1/10**

To call *Madame Web* a movie feels like an act of generosity. It is less a narrative film and more a corporate-approved collection of scenes haphazardly stitched together, devoid of soul, coherence, or basic competence. Walking in with zero expectations is no shield; its profound awfulness is so comprehensive it becomes an almost impressive feat of filmmaking malpractice.

### A Symphony of Failure

This isn't a film with one or two flaws; it is a masterclass in how to fail at every single element of the cinematic process:

*   **Casting & Acting:** The casting is baffling, pairing talented actors with a script that gives them nothing but wooden dialogue and motivations that change between scenes. The performances range from visibly bored to wildly over-the-top, with no one seeming to be in the same movie... or even the same dimension.
*   **Dialogue:** The script is a relentless assault of exposition, clunky one-liners, and lines so unnatural they feel generated by an AI trained on discarded soap opera transcripts. Characters don't converse; they announce plot points and then stop talking.
*   **Plot & Logic:** The premise is paper-thin, but the plot holes are a canyon. Character motivations are nonsensical, the rules of the titular powers are vague, contradictory, and conveniently forgotten, and the entire story feels like a first draft that was accidentally greenlit. The central conflict is so poorly defined it evaporates upon the slightest scrutiny.
*   **Direction & Pacing:** The direction is utterly lifeless. Action scenes are poorly choreographed and edited with all the tension of a grocery run. The ""climax"" is so anticlimactic and the ending so mind-blowingly ridiculous that it doesn't feel like a conclusion, but rather the film simply giving up out of exhaustion.

### The Embarrassment of a ""Power""

The film's cardinal sin might be its handling of its protagonist's abilities. Madame Web's clairvoyance, a potentially fascinating power, is presented in the most visually and narratively embarrassing way possible. The ""visions"" are repetitive, lack any sense of urgency, and ultimately render the character a passive observer in her own story. It is a superhero power that manages to be both overpowered and utterly useless, a perfect metaphor for the film itself.

### The Verdict

**1/10 - An Unmitigated Disaster**

*Madame Web* is not just a bad comic book movie; it is one of the worst films of the modern era. It is a hollow, cynical, and artistically bankrupt product that insults the intelligence of its audience at every turn. The one point it earns is for its sheer, audacious consistency in being terrible across the board.

**What was going through their minds?** It is a question with no satisfactory answer. Perhaps it was contractual obligation, a tax write-off, or a desperate attempt to cling to a shred of a fading cinematic universe. Whatever the reason, the result is the same: a piece of irredeemable trash that serves as a stark warning of what happens when filmmaking is stripped of every last shred of passion, skill, and purpose. Do not waste your time. Do not hate-watch it. Simply let it fade into the oblivion it so richly deserves.",2024-05-25T00:53:33.070Z,634492,1 star,0.7866677641868591

TheSceneSnobs,1.0,"Watching this film, I couldn't shake the feeling that the script was written by AI. The story, themes, and dialogue all feel utterly soulless. The lifeless acting only compounds the problem, making the entire experience miserable.

The story lacks any genuine emotion or creativity. It's as if the writers followed a formula without injecting any passion or originality into the script. The central conflict, which should be gripping and engaging, instead feels generic and uninspired. 

The dialogue is another significant issue. It’s stilted and unnatural, failing to convey any real depth or nuance. Characters speak in clichés and empty platitudes, making it hard to believe in their struggles or motivations.

The acting is equally disappointing. The cast delivers their lines with the enthusiasm of kids forced to do chores, contributing to the film's lifeless feel. This lack of energy and commitment can be attributed to both the actors and the director. 

Comparing this film to Roger Corman's infamous Fantastic Four movie might seem harsh, but it's a fitting analogy. Both films suffer from poor execution and a lack of soul. However, this film arguably fares worse due to its complete absence of engaging elements. To salvage such a project, the filmmakers would need to infuse genuine emotion into the script and inspire more compelling performances from the cast.

This film is a prime example of how not to craft a sci-fi narrative. Its soulless script, lifeless acting, and overall lack of direction make it a difficult watch. Audiences deserve more than a formulaic, uninspired story; they deserve a film that engages and excites on every level.",2024-07-09T16:42:08.410Z,634492,2 stars,0.5280500054359436

MovieGuys,5.0,"Land of Bland as I call it, is yet another uninspiring, production line, pro US military, action flick.

Coming kitted out with the usual pro US exceptionalism and bad guys who have a valid point about imperialism but are still ""bad"" anyway, this film offers nothing even remotely original or in this reviewers opinion, terribly likeable.

The characters are your usual array of entitled, obnoxious, US military types, who go on a flawed escapade in someone else's country to retrieve a CIA asset. Things turn sour and well the rest is your by the book, bravado, darning do, bravery, codswallop.

Fight scenes are frenetic, well paced and impressive. Lots of pyrotechnics and slow motion bullet and shell casing shots.Certainly from an exposition point of view, this film is not dull. 

Acting is unremarkable but its the story that really leaves a lot to be desired. Putting aside its predictable bias, this tale is cliched, pedestrian and utterly predictable. Its essentially, every stale, second rate, US military action flick, you have ever seen with Australians and New Zealanders, in the lead.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"""Lisa"" (Kathryn Newton) is a bit of a loner who lives in one of those second families where her rather feeble dad (Joe Chrest) has married the rather vain and odious ""Janet"" (Carla Gugino) who has a friendly daughter ""Taffy"" (Liza Soberano). At school, she has taken a shine to floppy-haired heart-throb ""Michael"" (Henry Einkenberry) and he seems to be a little interested too. Might romance blossom? Suddenly a lightening strike changes everything. The long-dead occupant of a grave she habitually sits beside when she is reading (Cole Sprouse) is electronically reinvigorated and finds his way into her home, her wardrobe and now, as with ""ET"", she has her own secret creature in the closet. Thing is, there are bits of her new friend missing - his ear, his tongue, his hand (that's not a comprehensive list!) - so the ensuing escapades mix science with comedy and some good old doses of vengeance as they try to restore him to his former, piano playing, glory. It could have been much more fun, this, if it had committed to the audience one way or the other. It's clearly gone for a wide appeal and so compromised on the darkness and adult nature of the humour. Many of the scenarios - especially at the the rather brutal and eye-watering conclusion, could have worked so much better had Zelda Williams aimed the movie more at those who could appreciate the dark comedy rather than dilute it down to something akin to a frat-comedy.

r96sk,5.0,"There are glimpses of goodness, though so short they don't hide the film's frailties.

<em>'Lisa Frankenstein'</em> is, in my opinion, a disappointment. I can kinda see what they were going for and at times I could appreciate it, but all in all it doesn't really work for me. I will say the pacing isn't actually that bad, the film went by relatively quickly. The two big weaknesses to me were the dialogue and simply the story in general, both are rather quite dull... if they weren't, I may have enjoyed this.

The cast are one of the film's more positive features. I like Kathryn Newton, I remember thinking she was great in the similarly underwhelming <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/freaky/"" rel=""nofollow"">Freaky</a>'</em> from 2020, and she does try with what she's got to work with here. Carla Gugino is possibly the standout, I would've liked to have seen more of her. Liza Soberano is alright, while Joe Chrest plays a literal continuation of his Ted Wheeler.

Then, our supposed protagonist becomes a psychopathic serial murderer, which apparently is not only okay, but something to laugh about and root for. Anyone crosses Lisa the slightest, they're fair game for being murdered and then mocked and their death celebrated with laughs and dancing.

Her conclusion to the fifth in the series about the eponymous, ""007""-style agent perplexes her mother, though. What happens next?

Brent Marchant,5.0,"It’s disappointing when a film has an intriguing premise but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Such is the case with director Matthew Vaughn’s latest, an action-adventure/comedy about an author of spy novels (Bryce Dallas Howard) who stumbles into a real-life espionage scenario that matches the plot of her latest novel, embroiling her in a web of ever-shifting intrigue with various nefarious parties. The problem here is that the film never quite latches onto a dedicated focus to make the picture work. Some of the comic bits are indeed quite funny, but they frequently get bogged down by a meandering story line that’s trying to follow a more conventional, twist-laden thriller format. It leaves viewers asking, “So what’s it going to be?” There’s also more than a little derivative material thrown in, such as story threads we’ve already seen before in movies like “Romancing the Stone” (1984), “The Long Kiss Goodnight” (1996) and any number of James Bond flicks. While it’s true that this release is intended to be a spoof of these titles (especially in scenes featuring Henry Cavill as a hilariously hammy 007 knock-off), there’s a big difference between paying tribute and playing unrepentant copycat. Then there’s the picture’s excessive length, coming in at a bloated 2:19:00 runtime, far longer than it needs to be, a failing attributable to an often-needlessly complicated plot, one that begins to try audience patience at times, especially in the back half. “Argylle” also features a cute, cuddly cat, Alfie, as a central character (at least in its trailer), but, like the narrative overall, the film doesn’t quite seem to know what to do with the supposedly frisky, fickle feline, an impression far different from what’s conveyed in the picture’s video marketing. All of this is a shame, because this title has both potential and some apparent strengths going for it, such as a fine soundtrack, superbly choreographed action sequences, and an excellent ensemble cast with the likes of Sam Rockwell, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O’Hara, Ariana DeBose, and a seriously underused Richard E. Grant, not to mention fine turns from Howard and Cavill as alter-egos of one another. This one isn’t nearly as bad as many critics have made it out to be, but it could have been substantially better with some significant retooling and judicious editing. “Argylle” apparently has ambitions to become a new franchise, too, but we’ll have to see if that materializes based on what kind of box office draw it ultimately produces. At this point, though, I think it has its work cut out for it.",2024-02-04T02:30:50.637Z,848538,2 stars,0.576141357421875

r96sk,5.0,"Such a peculiar film. Everything about it feels off.

I was initially a little unsure as to what I thought about <em>'Argylle'</em>, but in the end: it's a no from me. I couldn't actually tell you one thing that I properly liked about this, like at a push Sam Rockwell and Bryan Cranston are decent but even they get a bit hit-and-miss. There's just a constant tinge of lousiness that follows around throughout.

Bryce Dallas Howard feels miscast, even if she is fairly likeable. Henry Cavill is wooden (intentionally? doubtful), as is Dua Lipa but the musician has enough charm to make it work slightly. Speaking of music, all that is used here is alright but again feels off - mostly seems like the correct type of song, just the wrong exact choice of song... ""Electric Energy"" might grow on me, though.

What also doesn't help is the unavoidable feeling that it is a bad redo of <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/films/in/kingsman-collection/by/release-earliest/size/large/"" rel=""nofollow"">Kingsman</a>'</em>, which is expected given who directed this and all that they are planning with the two flicks behind the scenes.

The performances of Jenna Ortega and Martin Freeman are two that I found entertaining.

<em>'Miller’s Girl'</em> does deliver a strange story, one that does feel quite amateurly written and one that's deseprate to be salacious. For an ""erotic thriller"", it doesn't really show all that much - if, admittedly, that's for the best in this regard. I will say, though, that Ortega and Freeman play it all off well enough though, which is probably why I didn't hate it.

I'm not surprised to see it tank on Letterboxd, even if I'm evidently not someone who feels as negatively as a load of others do about this 2024 flick.

For quite a while, director Benoît Delhomme manages to keep the apprehensive and tense atmosphere going as the pair quite cleverly challenge us to choose whom to believe.

That said, there is an effective chemistry between these actors who quiet successfully imbue their characters with quite a potent mix of determination and as the title suggests, a protective instinct for those closest to them.

Having never seen the original film before watching this new adaptation, I approached it with an open mind and fresh perspective. As such, I won't be comparing it to the earlier version.

Firstly, the cameo appearance from an original cast member was a nice touch, though it didn't elicit the same level of excitement for me as it might for die-hard fans. Now, onto the movie itself.

""Mean Girls 2024"" is a hit-or-miss experience, depending on your perspective. Dedicated fans of the franchise will likely appreciate it for what it is. As someone who enjoys musicals and appreciates a variety of music genres, I found the film to be enjoyable.

Reneé Rapp's portrayal of Regina George showcases her stage background, but she eventually settles into the role as the movie progresses. Although her casting may initially seem odd due to her towering height, she brings energy to the character. Her catchy solo song stands out, showcasing her vocal talent.

The dynamics between characters, particularly Regina and Cady, felt a bit off to me, given their stark height difference. However, both actresses deliver strong vocal performances. The portrayal of Gretchen and Karen also adds to the mix of characters, each bringing their unique quirks to the screen.

The movie delves into LGBTQ+, transgender, and sexual themes, though without nudity, making it a film geared towards a younger audience. While these themes didn't bother me personally, they are prevalent throughout the movie.

Though I wasn't a fan of the casting choice for Damien, finding him too eccentric, I appreciated the performances of the main characters. The male lead, though not heavily featured, serves his purpose in the storyline.

Overall, I would consider watching ""Mean Girls 2024"" again, but perhaps not in theaters. I'm uncertain if I would allow my son to watch it due to the mature subject matter. Fans of the original ""Mean Girls"" or musical enthusiasts are likely to enjoy this adaptation. For those with a more casual interest in movies, it may be a good watch but not one that demands an immediate rewatch.",2024-09-02T13:39:28.691Z,673593,4 stars,0.440168172121048
CinemaSerf,6.0,"""Clay"" (Jason Statham) has worked for an off-the-books US government programme designed to provide the ultimate security to the democratic process by providing unlimited training and resources to a group of people whose job it is is to objectively protect the system. These folks are called ""beekeepers"" which is lucky because our Jason has decided to spend his well earned retirement doing precisely that. He rents some space in the barn of ""Eloise"" (Phylicia Rashad) and one evening she invites him round for supper. He arrives to find that she has committed suicide and a cursory investigation from her FBI daughter ""Verona"" (Emmy Raver-Lampman) reveals she was the victim of a callous scam that wiped out not just her savings, but $2 million from a charity she chaired. Yep, you've guessed it. ""Clay"" decides it's time to reactivate his account and get on the trail of these people regardless of just how high up the food chain the trail of complicity and corruption leads. Statham adopts a rather curious accent throughout this totally unoriginal and derivative action thriller that gets gradually more preposterous as it goes on. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons add a little box-office to the thing, but their roles are undercooked and the former is actually pretty hopeless throughout.

r96sk,8.0,"I'm conflicted about <em>'The Beekeeper'</em>.

On the one hand, it's fantastic entertainment as Jason Statham plays a brilliantly badass character - every scene with him is top, top notch. The editing, action and score are positives, though everything around those aforementioned elements is annoyingly very hit-and-miss... and I'm not sure how much the other bits affect my enjoyment.

Away from the great Statham, the cast are also up-and-down. Josh Hutcherson and Jeremy Irons are decent, I think inferior actors would've done much worse so those two do do well in fairness. Sadly, for Emmy Raver-Lampman & Co. on the FBI side of the story... not the best. I mean, they're OK but kinda boring at the same time.

Raver-Lampman's character is also quite lamely written, not the actress' fault of course but still. Without spoiling anything, I feel like her character should've been way more sympathetic to Clay's cause given the obvious - like, still 'do your job' absolutely but it's as if the character forgot what happened at the start of the movie.

The scummy organizations are also portrayed a bit too cartoony, based on what I've seen in real life about those sorta people is that they're usually lousy losers who happen to know how to do what they do - rather than 'Gen Z' (please do forgive me for using that term *shudder*) smartasses who party 24/7 as this 2024 release shows.

𝕽𝖎𝖈𝖍,9.0,"**The Beekeeper** is a serviceable action thriller that delivers what you would expect from a _Jason Statham_ vehicle: brutal fights, cheesy one-liners, and a simple revenge plot. The film is directed by David Ayer, who has a knack for creating gritty and violent urban settings, and written by Kurt Wimmer, who has a penchant for crafting absurd and convoluted sci-fi scenarios. The result is a mashup of John Wick, The Equalizer, and The Matrix, with a dash of bee-related humor and symbolism.

**Statham** plays _Adam Clay_, a reclusive beekeeper who lives on a farm owned by his elderly friend _Eloise Parker_ (**Phylicia Rashad**). When Eloise falls victim to a phishing scam orchestrated by a sinister tech company, Adam decides to use his skills as a former elite operative to track down and punish the culprits. Along the way, he encounters various obstacles and enemies, such as corrupt cops, hired goons, and a mysterious hacker known as The Queen (Ruby Rose). He also forms an unlikely alliance with Eloise's daughter, FBI agent Sarah Parker (**Emmy Raver-Lampman**), who is investigating the same case.

The film does not waste much time on exposition or character development, focusing instead on the action sequences and the spectacle. Statham is in his element as the stoic and efficient killing machine, dispatching his foes with a variety of weapons and martial arts moves. He also delivers some witty and sarcastic remarks, often involving bees or honey. The supporting cast is mostly forgettable, except for Rashad, who brings some warmth and dignity to her role, and Rose, who plays the villain with a mix of charm and menace.

The film's biggest flaw is its lack of originality and coherence. The plot is a generic and predictable revenge story, with some implausible twists and turns. The film also tries to incorporate some themes and messages about technology, society, and morality, but they are either underdeveloped or contradictory. For example, the film seems to criticize the dangers of data mining and online fraud, but also glorifies the use of hacking and surveillance by the protagonist. The film also uses the bee motif as a metaphor for Adam's identity and mission, but it is often inconsistent and superficial.

The Beekeeper is not a film that will challenge or surprise you, but it is a film that will entertain you if you are in the mood for some mindless and fun action. It is a popcorn flick that knows its strengths and limitations, and delivers on its promise of Statham kicking ass and cracking jokes. If you are a fan of his previous works, or of the action genre in general, you will probably enjoy this film.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,10.0,"I have to be honest and say that, if far left Hollywood had not turned out one woke turd after another but actually good movies as they used to a long time ago, this one might not have earned five out of five stars from me.

But since the Hollywood pedophiles have more or less ruined everything they touch the competition for good movies is more or less non-existent so here we go.

The movie is pretty much free of woke bullshit and far left preaching so that alone earns it at least two stars.

This movie is very much a John Wick style movie. Some dumbass criminals piss off the wrong guy and a fireworks display of martial arts and dead criminals follows.

Jason Statham, as Adam Clay aka The Beekeeper, is really at his best in this movie. He is a kick-ass, relentless, stone hard, killer focused on both revenge and the eradication of the human scum that preys on the weak and, in this case, stupid.

The bad guys, at least at the start, is an organization that runs on-line scams. When scamming the person that has taken Adam under her wings after his retirement it has unforeseen and tragic consequences.

Later in the movie this simple plot evolves, as the blurb states, to a national emergency due to the corrupt and criminal actors involved at high levels.

When I watched the movie I really thought that this entire scamming things was a bit unrealistic. I mean come on, people cannot be that stupid! But then I reminded myself that people also, allegedly, voted for a senile turnip brain with a kackling moron as vice president so I guess they can be.

As I wrote, Statham is really at his best. If we should compare with John Wick again, Statham is much more menacing and vengeful than Keanu Reeves ever was in John Wick.

I really like how the criminal asshats at all levels gradually gets their rightful, and usually terminal, punishment and that they most of the time gets to see and sweat as their doom approaches.

Also, the stunts are not at all as exaggerated and ludicrous as in the fourth John Wick installment. That does not mean that they are very realistic but then that is not really to be expected in this kind of action movie.

The story overall is not bad. It is an action movie type of story which means it is fairly simplistic, it has plot holes and it is not overly realistic but that is fine. It is good enough and it is Statham that carries the movie anyway.

This was indeed one of the best movies in a long time as far as I am concerned. Pure entertainment.

their other recent hit “Five Nights at Freddy’s”.

The movie stars Wyatt Russell and Kerry Condon as Ray and Eve Walter; a married couple trying to raise their two children and deal with Ray’s M.S.
diagnosis. Ray is a former Major League Baseball player and holds out hope that he can overcome his situation and make a return to his profession even if those around him do not.

A life on the road has caused Ray to miss many events such as the birth of their daughter as well as be distant from their son. A new job at a prestigious school offers Eve a chance to have the needed insurance for Ray and work to do while she completes her degree.

The family opt to purchase a home with a pool versus renting as the ability to finally have some stability and use the pool for therapy is a welcome combination. This is enhanced by the discovery that the pool is
actually filled by a natural water source which Ray believes is healing him and rapidly putting him on the road to recovery.

Things are not as they seem as the pool holds some dark and deadly secrets that go back for decades and the family soon finds themselves dealing
with forces beyond their control as they desperately try to survive.

The film has an interesting premise though at times I did think about various other films and some of the shock moments failed to get me as they did others in the audience but I am not one who startles easily.

The cast was strong but at times I found myself not caring as much for the outcomes of certain characters as I was more concerned with the overall
explanation behind the supernatural elements of the film.

Despite this, it was an enjoyable watch that provided something a bit different than the usual monster or psycho on the loose horror film and Co-Writer/ Director Bryce McGuire has adapted his short film well into a
film which provides just enough of what the core audience wants to make it an effective horror entry.

I had a fine time viewing <em>'Night Swim'</em>.

Brent Marchant,9.0,"In a movie awards season that has had more misses than hits, it’s gratifying to see one that not only lives up to, but exceeds, its potential. Such is the case with writer-director Andrew Haigh’s latest offering, a heartwarming and heartbreaking story of love, reflection and healing all rolled into one. To say too much about the film would invariably lead to a plethora of spoilers, but suffice it to say that it tells a genuinely moving and touching tale of a 30-something gay Londoner (Andrew Scott) and his budding relationship with a mysterious new beau (Paul Mescal), an involvement very much influenced by the protagonist’s relationship with his own past, most notably his involvement with his parents (Jamie Bell, Claire Foy). This is one of those pictures that’s just about perfect in virtually every regard thanks to its stringent adherence to authenticity in the writing and the portrayals of its positively stellar cast, especially the highly underrated performance by Foy, whose role has puzzlingly been flying under the radar thus far. It’s also a production that will likely surprise viewers in myriad ways, defying expectations and telling a story that’s anything but apparent from what’s in its promotional trailer. Moreover, I’m impressed by the fact that this is an offering featuring gay characters in which their sexuality is not the principal focus of the narrative, something that truly distinguishes this feature from so many others in this genre. Add to these attributes a sensitively chosen soundtrack and some surprisingly innovative cinematography, and you’ve got one helluva fine movie. To be sure, this is one of those releases that, if it doesn’t touch you profoundly, you’d better check to see if you have ice water coursing through your veins. “All of Us Strangers” richly deserves whatever accolades it receives. It’s one of the year’s best, bar none.",2024-01-14T02:54:45.244Z,994108,4 stars,0.5939227938652039
CinemaSerf,7.0,"""Adam"" (Andrew Scott) lives a rather lonely life atop a London tower block where he is struggling to write a new book. He's obviously had some success before, but right now he spends much of his time in front of the television watching video-taped editions of the BBC's ""Top of the Pops"" music programme. A fire alarms sends him onto the street where he espies the only other person living in their brand new building - who didn't bother to evacuate. Back upstairs that man knocks on his door, introduces himself as ""Harry"" (Paul Mescal) and suggests a night cap - with benefits! ""Adam"" declines and next day takes a train, goes for a walk and appears to pick up a man in a park. He follows him, they rendezvous outside an off-licence and we discover that this is actually his dad (Jamie Bell) who takes him home to his mum (Claire Foy) where they share a drink and a fond reminisce. He goes home and again bumps into ""Harry"" and we begin to sense that there is a smouldering chemistry between these two men that is slow-burning, but potent. In the course of their chat - one of those first date, polite, conversations about getting to know each other when you really just want to get on with some ""furious jumping"" - we discover something rather startling about his parents and this news completely recalibrates the story as the two men gradually see their relationship evolve and we learn a great deal more about what has led ""Adam"" to his current life of introspection and isolation. On many levels this is about intimacy. Sure, between the two men, but also between him and - separately and together - his parents and himself as we all embark on quite a poignant journey of discovery that doesn't shy away from issues of sexual and personal identity, (largely benign) ignorance and of longing. Not just physical longing, but psychological longing too. At times it reminded me of Haigh's must less sophisticated ""The Weekend"" (2011) in that it puts together two men in a closely knit scenario where neither know the other, both are distinctly different in personality and the conversational dialogue is plausible and relevant. The denouement takes a bit of getting used to - it's left field but then it isn't - before all fits quite neatly if disturbingly at the end. I've always been a fan of the ballsy Jamie Bell - and he delivers engagingly and emotionally here as does an on-form Mescal who again shows his acting diversity as the deliverer of character parts with, here, the perfect foil to the under-stated performance from Scott whose persona is about as enigmatic as I have seen. It benefits from a second viewing, and is most definitely not the slushy boy meets boy romance you might expect.

A lot of the story you can see coming from a decent ways away, even for someone like me who previously knew nothing about this family, but that only adds to the tinge of sadness that is present in the film from pretty much the get-go. The film does a grand job at making sure that events onscreen move along at a good pace, especially as some parts could've (but don't) felt repetitive if told differently.

There's an excellent showing from Zac Efron in this, such a great performance from that man. I also appreciated Holt McCallany, as well as the likes of Jeremy Allen White and Harris Dickinson. The Von Erich family are portrayed well, though it is a shame that I read that they left out brother Chris - I do get the reasoning as to why, but I feel like they should've found a way to at least acknowledge his existence.

All things considered, though, this 2023 release is tremendous. Highly recommended.",2024-02-09T20:13:34.176Z,850165,4 stars,0.6111575961112976
CinemaSerf,6.0,"Oh well, looks like I might be in the minority here - but what is all the fuss about? A domineering patriarch (Holt McCallany) is determined that all four of his sons will succeed in a wrestling ring where he didn't. His sons ""Kevin"" (Zac Efron) and ""David"" (Harrison Dicksinson) are destined to work for a shot at the world title, ""Kerry"" (Jeremy Allen White) for Olympic glory and finally ""Mike"" (Stanley Simons) - the more creative, musically minded, one brings up the rear. President Jimmy Carter and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan puts paid to the Olympic ambitions and so now the three siblings can work together to climb the rankings in Texas and maybe earn a shot at the world title. Meantime, plastic Zac falls in love with Pam (Lily James) and it's at their wedding that Kevin discovers his dad's favourite (David) might not be doing so well. Tragedy ensues, indeed an whole slew of tragedies follow the Von Erich family as their dogged pursuit of glory causes the family to reel from one disaster to another - without anyone seeming to learn from it! Now as family dramas go, it's a sad story - no doubt about that. As a piece of cinema, it merely marries a fairly mediocre script with living proof that the spirit of method acting is alive and well. Certainly these men have put their bodies through the mill, and the fight scenes do impress - but none of the rest of it looks or feels real. Their characters are under-cooked, the dynamic between the boys and the parents, their mother (Maura Tierney) especially, is scarcely addressed and by the time we reach the historically accurate conclusion, I found myself completely devoid of sympathy or empathy for a family that had no grasp of what was important. There's a touching line at the end about brotherhood, but it was all just too little too late in a story of obsession and ambition that just didn't engage me at all.",2024-02-15T15:15:34.580Z,850165,2 stars,0.5313166379928589
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,8.0,"First things first: “The Iron Claw” isn’t so much a movie about wrestling as it is a movie about family. Those expecting a traditional, feel-good biographical sports film may be slightly disappointed by this heart wrenching, hard-hitting drama from writer / director Sean Durkin. He brings the true story of the Von Erich brothers to the screen in one of the saddest movies of the year, and this tragic tale will absolutely rip your heart out.

In the competitive world of professional wresting in the early 1980s, West Texas family the Von Erichs were a household name. Led by their demanding father Fritz (Holt McCallany), the four brothers, Kevin (Zac Efron), David (Harris Dickinson), Kerry (Jeremy Allen White), and Mike (Stanley Simons) would often wrestle together and battle opponents in the ring. One of their main claims to fame was the popularization of the iron claw pro wrestling hold, a move that would almost always insure victory over the opposition. The family left a legacy in the sports world, but also had their share of personal demons. Over the years, the brothers had to fight something much more serious: years of misfortune and a string of personal tragedies that were believed to be a result of the “Von Erich curse.”

Durkin’s film is one of tragedy and triumph, and it’s packed with unbridled masculinity. With a domineering father who was more of a coach than a caring dad to a quietly suffering mother (a wonderfully understated Maura Tierney), the Von Erich brothers turned to the biggest stage in sports to seek immortality as athletes. Some of the brothers took to the spotlight (and the sport) better than others, but all of them wrestled to earn their father’s approval. The story is a painful one, and it’s made even more so because the family is so likeable. These aren’t inherently bad people, but it’s a sad reality that really awful things happen to good people. The Von Erichs are a clan that suffered far, far more than their fair share of tragedies.

Everything about the film clicks, with the directing, writing, storytelling, and acting working together in harmony. Efron is nothing short of breathtaking with a performance that is incredibly demanding both emotionally and physically (his physique is startling, and he’s so buff it’s borderline scary). White and Dickinson hold their own in equally strong supporting roles, and Simons’ gentle turn as their youngest, most sensitive brother is highly affecting.

The film has its cliché-ridden moments, but Durkin’s vision is fully realized across the board. The wrestling scenes in the ring are perfectly edited and thrilling, and the highly emotional, dramatic scenes leave an impact.

“The Iron Claw” definitely is not a feel-good movie, and it is at times unbearably sad. But this is a beautifully made film that chronicles the rise, fall, and unfathomable misfortune that befell one of the most influential families in the sport of wrestling.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Johnny Flynn performs quite well here as the young stockbroker Nicholas Winton who arrives in Prague just as the Nazis annexe the Sudetenland. He is horrified by the child poverty that he sees and decides, perhaps naively, to work with his British Refugee Council colleagues to try and expedite their removal to a safer and altogether earthier environment. Fortunately, his mother Babette (Helena Bonham Carter), herself from immigrant stock, is no slouch when it comes to doorstepping officials in Whitehall and soon has convinced the authorities to agree a fast-track mechanism that will enable him to get the children back to the UK provided they have guaranteed foster homes and the fairly massive sum of £50 as a guarantee. He returns to London and a massive public awareness/fundraising campaign ensues - as do eight trains carrying over six hundred children to safety. We are told this story via a series of flashbacks from the modern day Winton (Sir Anthony Hopkins) who now lives peacefully with his wife Greta (Lena Olin) in Berkshire. He is perusing a scrapbook he has left in a drawer for forty-odd years in which he has photographs and details of many of those passengers on the ""Kinder"" trains. His friend from back then (Jonathan Pryce) manages to put him in touch with Betty Maxwell - the wife of the wealthy publisher Robert, and next thing he is on British television's most popular ""That's Life"" programme that regularly reached 18 million people on a Sunday evening. This appearance poignantly introduces him to one survivor, his next sees that snowball into some sixty or so who owed their life and liberty to the efforts of Winton and his colleagues - whom he is always very clear to ensure are never forgotten. I recall watching this programme back in the day and the dramatisation is no less moving than the original broadcast. Sir Anthony offers us a considered performance - demonstrating a shy family man who rejects the trappings of fuss and celebrity because he sees his behaviour as nothing special. Doing the right thing. His efforts are touching and understated and nicely dovetail with the rather pushy and forthright Bonham Carter fighting tooth and nail against red tape in 1939. As an insight to Nazi tyranny it also works subtly. We see very little actual violence, but we see a squalor and hopelessness that robs the soul of hope as depressingly as the situation robs their stomachs of food. The film looks good and is sparingly scripted allowing our own imagination to do much of the thinking here.",2024-01-11T07:46:50.814Z,760774,4 stars,0.6022669076919556
r96sk,8.0,"A touching picture featuring Anthony Hopkins.

<em>'One Life'</em> is <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/schindlers-list/"" rel=""nofollow"">Schindler's List</a>'</em>-esque, though perhaps more of a grounded portrayal of such events without the proper Hollywood-ness drama that that aforementioned flick holds; no hate on that sensational Steven Spielberg production by any means, it's a far better film in fact. This 2023 release is very hearty though, one of those movies where it is impossible not to care for the people onscreen.

There are plenty of emotional scenes that touch the feels, with one involving Hopkins right at the end particularly hitting. That man is excellent throughout, as expected. Johnny Flynn impresses too, he is just as important here as the Welshman. Helena Bonham Carter is a little underused, especially given she's on the cover, but very good.

Brent Marchant,6.0,"For some of us, there’s no stopping when it comes to seeing through on a mission of vital importance. So it was in 1938, when a dedicated English stockbroker selflessly enabled the successful escape of 669 children (mostly Jewish) from Prague not long after the Third Reich “annexed” Czechoslovakia’s Sudetenland region, the first step toward Germany’s invasion of the country and the eventual onset of World War II. British-born Nicholas Winton (Anthony Hopkins), the descendant of German Jewish ancestors, and members of the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia both on the ground and in London worked tirelessly against seemingly impossible odds to facilitate the youngsters’ flight to freedom. In particular, Winton’s younger self (Johnny Flynn) and his determined mother (Helena Bonham Carter) battled a reluctant British bureaucracy, intolerant prejudicial attitudes and border-crossing obstacles to arrange protective train transport across Europe to secure the safety of the young refugees. But, for all of Winton’s successes, he felt remorse that he was unable to do more, especially when he looked back on what he accomplished 40 years after the fact. Thankfully, his efforts didn’t go unnoticed, at last receiving the recognition for what he did, earning him the gratitude of the survivors and the honors of a grateful nation, in essence becoming the UK’s counterpart to Oskar Schindler. Director James Hawes tells a compelling story in his debut feature film, though the execution, regrettably, could use some shoring up, especially in the film’s sluggishly paced, overly talky and occasionally meandering opening half. The picture’s back end, however, considerably makes up for these deficiencies, evoking genuine, well-earned, heartfelt emotions, qualities that could have made for a better release overall if they had been employed more fully earlier on. This is largely made possible by the powerful performances of Hopkins, Flynn, Bonham Carter and a host of supporting players, along with fine period piece production values. “One Life” ultimately delivers a message that we could all stand to hear more often, not only in supporting monumental undertakings like those depicted here, but also in being giving of ourselves in general, no matter how great or small the efforts or ventures might be. The world would certainly be a better place for doing so – and for the work of the Nicholas Wintons that reside within all of us.",2024-03-27T05:25:09.235Z,760774,4 stars,0.4959445893764496

Deciding to watch ""One Life"" with a group of young boys turned out to be a challenge, as they were not keen on sitting through a historical film. Despite the initial hesitation, the movie proved to be a captivating true story that left a lasting impact.

The film follows the remarkable journey of a man from England who lived to the age of 106 and dedicated his life to a refugee rescue mission, saving nearly 700 children. The emotional core of the story comes to life when these children, now adults, reunite with the man who changed their lives on a television show, expressing their heartfelt gratitude.

Set against the backdrop of World War II and the atrocities of Hitler, ""One Life"" offers a poignant and powerful narrative that showcases the resilience and compassion of the human spirit. While it may not be a blockbuster film that demands a trip to the theaters, it is a movie worth watching for its historical significance and moving storytelling.

Well not for long! ""Black Manta"" (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is still a tad narked after the last film (five years ago!) and now armed with an useful geek ""Dr. Shin"" (Randall Park) sets out to discover a secret trident that will enable him to destroy ""Atlantis"" altogether and maybe also release the long captive ""Kordax"" (wasn't that the stuff they used to make telephone cables from?) to help make his revenge complete.

With battles lines drawn the films goes from ""Narnia"" to ""Middle Earth"" via the ""Lost World"" and even a bit of ""Ice Station Zebra"" for a series of ploddingly slow and disappointing set-piece adventures. To be fair, the last half hour does lift the pace a little, but by then I'm not sure if it wasn't all just a rather too late. Momoa is trying very hard here, but he's no Dwayne Johnson, and even the dulcets of John Rhys-Davies as the ""Brine King"" - with or without his claw - can't really raise this from it's pretty weak and feeble doldrums. Of course it looks good, loads of quality CGI and visual effects, but the story is light and overly strung out for two hours that really did feel more like two days at times. It's harmless fodder for Christmas cinema with very little to actually dislike about it - it's just the latest in a series of equally forgettable super-hero films that I suspect will leave no impact at all in the snow afterwards.",2023-12-24T12:28:49.987Z,572802,3 stars,0.5127347707748413

And the result was - I had a very fun evening in the movie theatre. The best movie to grab yourself a large bag of popcorn, put your brain on stand-by and enjoy a fun ride.

The story, admittedly, was nothing special. It was enough there to make you follow the plot, but other than that - there wasn't much there. Could it have been better? Yes. Does that kill the movie? No.

This movie is more like a guilty pleasure for me and I would watch it because of the world of Aquaman and all of its details. This is were the movie really shines. The production design is 10/10 for me. And the action is good, too.

So, if you want a deep and very good story, you might be disappointed.

But if you are somebody to enjoy a fun and very well made ""Superhero Aquaman theme park ride"", a classical ""grab yourself a bag of popcorn and turn your brain off"" movie - this one may be for you.",2024-11-12T01:24:27.903Z,572802,4 stars,0.5480735898017883
The Movie Mob,6.0,"**Rebel Moon is a flawed space epic that can’t compete with Star Wars or Dune but offers some fun for genre fans that don’t take it too seriously.**

Rebel Moon adds the small, growing resistance struggling against a galactic tyrannical empire of Star Wars to the small village searching for a band of noble warriors to save them of Seven Samurai (or the Magnificent Seven or The Three Amigos), but falls short of capturing the greatness of its inspirations. However, while Rebel Moon Part One might be self-aggrandizing and annoyingly predictable, it’s still a fun movie. Director Zack Snyder skillfully constructs a visually stunning universe, filled with vibrant colors and innovative creature effects. Although the characters lack substantial backstories, they still manage to captivate the audience's curiosity. Snyder also cleverly includes intriguing hints that would undoubtedly entice viewers to return for a potential sequel. Despite grappling with shallow writing and occasional subpar CGI, Rebel Moon successfully held my interest, kept me entertained, and left me willing to give Part Two a chance.",2023-12-23T14:41:55.256Z,848326,4 stars,0.5138123631477356
BornKnight,6.0,"Another Zack Snyder movie another wave of haters, so nothing new here.

I found it pretty well done, the CGI is magnificent on some points; the choice for protagonist as Sofia Boutella (Atomic Blonde) was the best? No. But it isn't so bad. For a movie that is to be his version of SW it isn't bad... reminds me a bit a medieval / western space opera with a Warhammer 40.000 touch. 

About being a SW or Seven Samurai ""copy""..... really? So what? People can tell the movies the way they want, so nothing is absolutely new nowadays, it isn't mind blowing but decent. It is like invalidating SW because we had ST before or Gallactica almost at the same year.

My greatest gripe about the movie isn't about the interval between this one and the second movie (April 18th, 2024) so yeah almost two to three years for the complete Trilogy if it hits the public well. 

The gripe was to put a final fight against the guy that seemed to be the main villain, turns out he is like Darth Maul in the end, and yeah with a confront in the end to have some more action. The real Darth Vader (let's not speak of SW Emperor here because he was the excuse to continue the trilogies). Generally speaking the trio of Snyder (too ambitious), Kurt Johnstad (300 - is ok) and Shay Hatten (John Wick 3 and 4... that almost don't have story) isn't a good choice.

Visually speaking beside the pseudo-archaic western / samurai setdown (including a bar fight) I found it was an ok choice especially being in the outside worlds of the Empire. Acting was ok, Boutella could have replaced by another actress more charismatic - about the others not much to be said as it is and introduction and gathering of heroes (or rebels if you like the way the title says). Each one have a distinct personality and background yet to be seen.

The CGI and practical effects and prosthetics are very nice - Anthony Hopkins as the robot is just really 5 minutes of the movie yet to be seen. The visual of the ships reminded me of those 70's japanese space opera (yep, Space Battleship Yamato it is with other references) with a Warhammer 40k touch to the villains. 

The edition is good (Dody Dorn of Memento) and Junkie Xl (or Tom Holkenborg - that works mostly with adventure movies) is an ok choice but without any memorable music here.

Out of the weak ending fight scene (or rush in the history maybe to generate more interest and income for the other two movies) for this one no reason for a major gripe about this one.

The biggest let downs are this and the cooldown to see more in more than one year only. And I have a small feeling that all the trilogy won't be enough to fill and the spots left open into characters and development into the story if are all 6 hours total. This is a point that a better screenplay would be needed.

So let's wait a ""bit"" more to see where it leads. From my point of view a 6.5 out of 10.0 / B- for now. 

Don't listen to the Snyder haters, watch and judge for yourself - I had more a 70's japanese space opera feeling for this one than SW.",2023-12-23T22:47:07.861Z,848326,3 stars,0.4701277017593384

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Anyone remember ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" (1980)? Well this is a sort of hybrid of that and the ""Magnificent Seven"" that is quite impressive to look at, but that's about the height of it. A political assassinations has destabilised the kingdom and so ""General Noble"" (Ed Skrein) is off in his Dreadnought to terrorise the inter-planetary population. He arrives on a peaceful agrarian planet, kills the town father and declares that he'll be back in ten weeks to collect their harvest of grain. Panic sets in, especially when the guards he leaves behind try to force themselves on a villager and they encounter the wrath of ""Kora"" (Sofia Boutella). She's pretty nimble with her weaponry (so we just know there's a story here somewhere) and also manages to convince the town wimp ""Gunnar"" (Michael Huisman) that they must set off to recruit some help they can use to thwart the destruction of their livelihoods by ""Noble"". What we have now are a series predicable, set-piece, escapades as gradually they assemble a disparate band of rogues and criminals who might just want to take on the general in an hopelessly one-sided contest. You might detect the voice of Sir Anthony Hopkins (""Jimmy"") and Charlie Hunnam sports a variable Irish accent as the famed ""Kai"" as this follows extremely well trammelled lines of adventure mixed with romance, political intrigue and some whizzo special effects. The denouement is straight out of ""Attack of the Clones"" (2002) and sets us up for a second instalment that you could probably just about map out now. I like the genre and I didn't hate the film, but it's disappointingly derivative and - well, you've just seen it all before.",2023-12-25T10:54:08.213Z,848326,3 stars,0.5531589388847351
thorian93,5.0,"Today I enjoyed: Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire.

And let me say it up front: The only good thing about this movie - was the bad guy.

Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire was originally thought to be a Star Wars story. However, Disney did not like what Zack Snyder had to offer, as he wanted to build a new story with new characters and more gore than the original Star Wars movies. And after seeing the movie, I get a sense of why Disney took a rain check on it.

The film opens with a shot of a young female farmer, working hard on a field in a what seems to be medieval, maybe viking village, only contrasted by the huge red orangish planet in the background. But here the problems already start. Nothing looks real. You instantly get this uncanny valley kind of feeling, that something is off.  This opening scene already reveals that almost everything was shot in a studio in front of a huge LED screen - called a stage craft - and you recognize this throughout the entire movie.

And as if that was already bad, there are constant J. J. Abrams style lens flares, the CGI at times feels lazy at best, I honestly started to question if I was seeing a live action movie, or some animation flick. To be fair, I watched it at home on my TV, as Netflix - who eventually took on Snyders project - decided to put this film directly on the stream, skipping the cinema screenings.

The saddest part in my humble opinion though is, that there are actually competent actors involved, like Djimon Hounsou, Charlie Hunnam and Bae Doona, but the movie does not facilitate their skills at all. Hell, even Sofia Boutella can literally kick ass, if you give her some good action scenes. But while the former actors get way to little time to bring their characters to life properly, the main character played by Sofia Boutella mostly stands in the background of her own movie changing from frowning to slightly smiling, depending on the occasion.

And do not get me started on the fight scenes. The very first fight scene, which has an intense setup and a lot of potential felt really odd. From the style, I was expecting some blood at least, but the movie stays on a weird line between rough close combat, that would justify bloodshed on the one hand and classical PG13 rated laser gun fights on the other. It looks like the more gory parts were cut, which makes sense, if you consider that the word is, there will be a second version coming. A Snyder Cut, if you will, that is considerably longer than this version and way more brutal. But time will tell, if that is true and if it will be the better movie. But I doubt, that even that longer version will provide enough background story for the characters and the full universe the film takes place in.

The only silver lining - as already mentioned in the beginning - is Ed Skrein as the antagonist. He delivers a chilling science fiction version of a Nazi general, reminiscing Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds. He acts gentle and civilized at first, only to switch to brutal maniac in an instant, showing his real face.

Overall this motion picture was a big disappointment. I am a big fan of science fiction and I can forgive quite some mistakes. But this was too much after all and even with all the good will I could find in me, the flaws are just too obvious.

Maybe part two will make this movie whole, maybe it should have been a single film in the first place. But my recommendation, if you are not a die hard science fiction fan, is to save these two hours of your life for something else.

r96sk,8.0,"<em>'Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire'</em> is an enjoyable ride!

I will say that I wasn't ever totally engrossed into the story, though at every moment I was still very interested in what I was watching unfold - and for a movie that has a run time of around 134 minutes, that's a big plus. I particularly liked the world building, as well as the special effects.

Sofia Boutella is a great choice to lead the ensemble, her performance is one that I thoroughly enjoyed throughout. Ed Skrein is solid in a, shock horror, antagonistic role (does that geezer ever play a good guy?), I've found him quite meh in other movies but here he is very much a positive. None of the others onscreen stand out on their onesies, though as an collective they are a fairly strong cast.

I genuinely had a good time with this, can't ask for more than that. I'm fairly lukewarm on Zack Snyder movies, this is the seventh of his work that I've watched and <em>'Man of Steel'</em> and this are the only ones that I'd actually class as exceptional.

Lachlan Thiele,9.0,"<b>INT. LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS - NIGHT</b>

Auschwitz is the location of the world's most unforgivable crime — where humanity lost itself. An area forever marked with the horrors of xenophobia and a story that filmmakers continuously attempt to display on the screen. While holocaust cinema isn't being worked into the ground like other genres, there hasn't been a breath of fresh air for a while. 

<i>The Zone of Interest</i> is that breath.

From the get-go, you're engulfed back into Auschwitz, except in this film, there is a gorgeous house bordering the concentration camp. Immediately this large grey wall hiding the atrocities is juxtaposed with the family's beautiful garden, which their mother wishes to continue improving, never mind the continuous screaming and low rumbling furnace in the area. What <i>Johnathan Glazer</i> does with the sound design of this film is incredible; through audio alone, you're left with a sense of dread; how could you sleep when all you can hear are screams? The film opens with a black screen and an audio scape, immediately setting the tone.

""The Zone of Interest is one of the most memorable, remarkable films of the last few years. Jonathan Glazer achieves a fascinating dissociation between the general tone of the movie and the mundane actions of the protagonist family, portraying the unbelievably shocking global apathy in the face of the greatest crime in human history.

An extremely complicated viewing, excruciatingly frustrating, full of negative emotions, and not very accessible to the general public. The atmospheric, static cinematography, together with the powerful score and especially the background sounds that will haunt any viewer, justify the use of the term ""masterpiece"" to technically describe the film.

But more important than discussing technicalities and the explored themes, or rating a movie like this, is learning from the mistakes of the past that sadly insist on persevering...""

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Christian Friedel is quite effective in his portrayal of the Nazi commandant Rudolf Höss here. He and wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) offer us one of the most stark contradictions I think I've ever seen on screen. The beautifully manicured garden of a delightful family home with an unique next door neighbour. That would be the Auschwitz concentration camp of which he was in control. We follow his selection to run the place, his increasing role in implementing the extermination processes and then gradually, as he is promoted again, their realisation that the idyllic life they want for themselves is doomed. It's the brutal comparisons that work best here. We don't really see anything graphic on screen, that's all left to our already well enough developed imagination. The blissful ignorance of their children, the ample supply of food and the prevailing attitudes that nothing at all is amiss compares frighteningly with the real life ghastliness of those just a few feet across a large concrete wall. I suppose it could have more meat on it's bones - maybe just a little too much is left to our own interpretation and it can be a little slow at times, but it still delivers well as a template for just how many people thought the mass killings was hardly more important than whether or not they'd run out of eggs. It's not an history lesson - there are corners cut and licence is certainly taken with some of the timelines, but it's still a poignant look at human behaviour that's well worth a watch.",2023-11-23T09:04:11.799Z,467244,4 stars,0.730675458908081
Brent Marchant,7.0,"Some movies just have to be seen, even if they make for a difficult watch, and writer-director Jonathan Glazer’s latest is one of those pictures. While this offering is at times a bit uneven, when it’s on, it’s on, leaving a powerfully indelible mark on viewers, one that you feel in your gut and your heart and can’t get out of your mind. The film tells the unnerving story of the family of Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel). They reside directly next door to the infamous Nazi concentration camp, somehow managing to live seemingly “normal” lives in the shadow of this horrendously notorious facility. What’s most chilling, however, is that the family seems largely oblivious to the atrocities taking place on their doorstep, focusing more on their social activities and material possessions instead, even with the routine sounds of gunfire and the sight of billowing smoke from mass crematoriums filling the surrounding skies. In portraying this, the filmmaker doesn’t need to resort to graphic, gratuitous imagery to make his point about the unspeakable acts unfolding so close to home; comparatively simpler depictions of these events (and their aftermath) speak volumes instead, creating some of the most implicitly unsettling sights ever captured on film. As a consequence, this approach really makes one wonder how anybody could be so wantonly callous and unfeeling, making for truly troubling viewing. Yet it’s also the kind of imagery that has to be seen for its full impact to sink in. This Oscar nominee for best picture – and the recipient of numerous other competition and film festival accolades throughout awards season – richly deserves the attention it has garnered, even if it’s an inherently disturbing watch (sensitive viewers take note). To be sure, there are some pacing issues that could stand to be rectified, and a few story threads could use better clarity, but the picture’s superb cinematography and fine performances by its excellent ensemble cast (especially Sandra Hüller as the commandant’s self-absorbed wife) are undeniably noteworthy. This might be a film that no one wants to screen – but that everybody nevertheless should.",2024-01-28T23:24:35.105Z,467244,4 stars,0.4468754231929779
Cinema_Snobb,9.0,"Even in the middle of a war, there are two world's that exist side by side.  One of ever day life.  Raising kids.  Working a job. Gardening. Having lunch with friends.

Yet...over the wall is horrors.

Rudolf Hoss is a commandant at Auschwitz during World War II.  His wife Hedwig, played by Sandra Huller, and his children all live in the family homes over the wall from the camp.  They live a normal life, and Hedwig prides herself on the beautiful flowers and swimming pool to enjoy. 

And just over the wall Jews are be incinerated.

When Rudolf gets a transfer, Hedwig's life goes into turmoil at the thought of leaving the lovely home she loves.

And just over the wall Jews are being incinerated.

There's a haunting scene that shows the results of Hedwig's gardening.  It shows close-ups of the all the different flowers and plants that have been lovingly been cultivated.  They are stunningly beautiful.  In the background the sounds of barking dogs and screaming and yelling can be heard.

And just over the wall Jews are being incinerated.

There is so much about this film that is disturbing.  It presents an angle to the war and the concentration camps that I haven't seen before.  We often forget about ""normal"" life going on at the same time.

Huller is excellent, just as she was in ""Anatomy of a Fall"".  The film is leisurely and quiet.  It doesn't show the horrors of what is going on next door, but it doesn't need to since those horrors permeate every scene.

BornKnight,9.0,"The Zone of Interest is a 2023 historical drama film written and directed by Jonathan Glazer, loosely based on the 2014 novel by Martin Amis, that based herself on the life that Rudolf Höss, Nazi commandant of Auschwitz concentration camp from 1940-43 must had in that time in his residence, just at the side of the camp.

It premiered at the 76th Cannes Film Festival, winning both the Grand Prix and FIPRESCI Prize. For the 96th Academy Awards, it received 5 nominations (including Best Motion Picture, Best International Feature Film, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound) - for me best sound is almost a win, and have great chances for best international movie and adapted screenplay.

Both Christian Friedel as Rudolf Höss and Sandra Hüller (from Anatomy of a Fall) as Hedwig Höss are exceptional in their roles.

It focus on the idyllic live of the Nazi commander, in his house on the most normal life conditions, while the Holocaust and the killing machine he created works at just some meters of distance. 

The camera focus on medium and large plans, often showing the life of the dreams, but on the horizon we often see signs of the terror like smoke from the locomotives and from the enormous chimneys at the distance.

We also have other signs, extremely subtle, like the sound of shouts and shots at the background, that only shows as more close in rare sequences.

Other sequences like the girl, shoot in Infrared that left at night apples and fruits for the camp workers are just haunting (and the cause of one of the more aggressive shout sequence I mention above).

Interesting enough is the view as close the view of the  concentration camp is on the movie in the past, and in the present as a memorial. Both are unmistakable, but in either vision a far cry from what the reality must have been inside them.

MovieGuys,8.0,"The Zone of Interest takes the notion of the ""banality of evil"", back to its true origin, the family home. 

All human evil starts with a home. In this instance, the home of a concentration camp commander, Rudolf Höss, of Auschwitz and his family. The laid back ease of middle class family life, of an upper management level Nazi, is juxtaposed with suffering of people (Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, political dissidents, religious minorities and yes even some allied soldiers, who were prisoners of war), who quite literally reside, over the fence, in the concentration camp, Hoss oversees.

This is a quietly horrifying film where the an idyllic and wholly familiar family setting is punctured, by the occasional sounds of misery and death, emanating from neighbouring death camp. Smoke stacks, burn human remains, that rise beyond the family fence line. In another compelling scene, a Hoss family riverside outing is disrupted by human ash, floating with the waters current.

The Zone of Interest is not a demonstrably violent film. Violence is hinted at and as we can see, is psychologically and physically partitioned off, from the peaceful home life, of Hoss and his family. 

This is a compelling film but I did feel it overplayed its hand somewhat with discordant music and oddly dissonant night vision scenes, with a girl apparently trying to help the victims of the camps, by leaving food for them, at work sites, concealed next to their tools.

The Family Plan is an entertaining film, largely due to the charisma of its lead stars.

Thankfully, Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Monaghan's performances add some enjoyment to the film, preventing it from being completely dismissible.

The narrative, though formulaic and predictable, maintains a rather lively pace, ensuring a sustained interest.

CinemaSerf,5.0,"Anyone remember Henry Goulding's ""Assassin Club"" (2023)? Well if you add that in with the repetitive bits from ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" (2005) then you will arrive at something akin to this unremarkable thriller. ""Emma"" (Kaley Cuoco) is married to ""Dave"" (David Oyelowo) but she has a secret. She's part of an international organisation that gets paid to kill folk. She wants to leave that organisation and so it declares open season. Meantime she and her husband decide to celebrate their anniversary by hooking up in an hotel bar and pretending that they'd never met before - an opportunity for some good on fashioned courting and a few vodka Martinis. Enter the scene saving Bill Nighy as the ostensibly single old fellow alone in the hotel trying to hit on her. Of course, he's not quite what he seems and a slightly comedic scenario ensues. Sadly, though, thereafter this is all just a standard cat and mouse adventure with loads of set piece out of the frying pan into the fire escapades that gradually draw in her unwitting husband, their children and of course some family baggage from her past courtesy of Connie Nielsen. As ever, the menacing baddies couldn't shoot their way out of a rice-paper bag and her ninja skills become the stuff of ""Kung Fu"" - only without any sense of mystery or subtlety. The acting is stiff and the dialogue must have taken a few more Martinis to concoct before resorting to the ""Janet and John"" book of college film scripting. I wonder just how many more deadly killers there are lurking around the suburbs of small American towns!

""Ferrari has the potential to be a memorable biopic but lacks a more thoughtful emotional focus in its performance-driven character study. Adam Driver is excellent, but Penélope Cruz clearly stands out with an emotionally devastating performance.

The dialogues between the main couple are the highlights of a globally abrupt film that deals with the deaths of people outside the family nucleus in a manner that is too fleeting and insignificant, in addition to overdramatizing a particular subplot.

Competent racing sequences. It fulfills the basic purpose of telling the story of a complex man whose life is much sadder than one can imagine.""

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Perhaps Adam Driver thought his ""House of Gucci"" (2021) role would better qualify him to play the eponymous and visionary Italian motor sport impresario, but what we really end up with here is more in the vein of the recent Bradley Cooper ""Maestro"". Sure, there are some great re-enactments of the races - though maybe not at the beginning with Driver's faced superimposed into a car like you'd put a kid's face on a birthday card. The bulk of the rest of this is more a treatment of his tempestuous marriage with Laura (an uncharacteristically flat Penélope Cruz) and how he juggles his family - and their past tragedies - with his second family with Lina (Shailene Woodley) and son Piero (Giuseppe Festinese) about whom his wife knows nothing! The business is struggling. The production car manufacture is no longer paying for the racing cars and with bankruptcy looming, Enzo must put all of his eggs into the one basket that is the thousand mile endurance Mille Miglia and hope to win and generate extra sales. It's this last half hour that brings the film to life. You can almost smell the fumes of the engines as the cars race the narrow and treacherous roads of rural, post war, Italy. There's also an indication of the honour amongst the drivers and an awareness of the respect that they have for each other - especially as we know fatality and disaster are frequently in that cockpit too. At it's best, it's an intense and well photographed almost documentary style of film, but there's too much pointless, meandering, melodrama with a leading man who just hasn't a charismatic bone in his body. Although I didn't hate it, it was way too much about a flawed marriage and not about the engineering that made me care.",2023-12-30T11:46:41.023Z,365620,3 stars,0.5926982164382935

""Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget is a satisfying sequel that should please its target audience. The new cast bears the responsibility of successfully keeping the iconic characters recognizable while maintaining the unique charm of the original film.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"So now that our intrepid band of chickens have escaped the menacing clutches of ""Mrs. Tweedy"", they set up home on a peaceful little island. Thing is, their feathered brethren on the mainland are in even more danger than they were before, and when ""Ginger"" finds out the gang decide to launch a daring raid on a new, state of the art, factory that has one single purpose: to turn chickens into nuggets! Sneaking in, they quickly discover that the entire population are well fed and kept in good conditions - but they are also all controlled by radio controlled collars that ensure they do the bidding of... well...you can guess. Can they thwart the dastardly plan to cover the entire flock in breadcrumbs? I didn't especially like the combination of animation styles here. The traditional Aardman stop-motion characters are still there in abundance but surrounded by quite a lot of rather linear looking CGI. That rather sterilises the look of the story which, itself, is really far too strung out. The film is just half an hour too long and maybe just a little too formulaic as well. Still, it extols all the virtues of teamwork and loyalty, the script is quite entertaining at times and the gadgets and slightly slapstick nature of the humour, with a touch of ""007""-style menace, does make it worth a watch.

Brent Marchant,8.0,"When the circumstances of our lives don’t suit us, it’s time to reinvent ourselves – something that happens both literally and metaphorically in this latest offering from director Yorgos Lanthimos. But the way that result comes about here represents a truly inspired fusion of genres, including comedy, romance, social commentary and sci-fi, making for one of the most inventive, unusual and hilarious releases of recent years. This offbeat feminist fable tells the story of how a pregnant, young, anonymous suicide victim (Emma Stone) is reanimated with the aid of a brain transplant from her unborn fetus, an achievement accomplished by a colorful, controversial but well-meaning surgeon/scientist a la Dr. Frankenstein (Willem Dafoe). He nurtures his subject back to life, health and sentience, a sometimes-challenging process that finally surfaces when she discovers sexuality, the trigger for exploring a new, independent life for herself, both physically and emotionally. Through a series of adventures over the course of a trip through Europe with a free-wheeling, lusty but lecherous, self-serving lawyer (Mark Ruffalo), she finds herself as a self-actualized woman in an age where that’s more of a rarity than a standard, particularly in a world where men treat women more like property than people. While the film’s pacing could use some shoring up in the middle, this offering nevertheless entertains with uproarious laughs throughout, even when the narrative turns more thoughtful and substantive. The superb performances by Stone, Dafoe and Ruffalo are top shelf, contributing to the picture’s whopping 13 Critics Choice Award and 7 Golden Globe Award nominations. The film is also visually stunning in its cinematography and editing, as well as in its spectacular and whimsical production design, filled with images reminiscent of the movies of Wes Anderson and Terry Gilliam while sustaining a look all its own. Admittedly, this release features a good deal of explicit sexuality, both visually and in the dialogue, so sensitive viewers should take note. However, as one of the most anticipated pictures of this year’s awards season, “Poor Things” never disappoints, serving up a solid offering that consistently tickles the funny bone while giving audiences much to think about – and there’s nothing poor in any of that.",2023-12-17T23:52:53.939Z,792307,4 stars,0.6225316524505615
CinemaSerf,7.0,"It's almost as if Yorgos Lanthimos had sat down for a transcendental conversation with James Whale! Student ""Max"" (Ramy Youssef) is a student recruited by his professor ""Godwin"" (Willem Dafoe - aka ""God"") to come and help him work on his latest project. She's called ""Bella"" (Emma Stone) and it soon transpires that she is the product of some very creative surgery on the part of ""God"" - a man who has, himself, had one or two experiences under the knife at the hands of his scientist father! You see, a pregnant woman took her own life by jumping from a bridge, but was luckily fished out of the water before her baby died. The surgeon managed to deliver the baby then replace the dead brain of the adult with the one from the nascent infant! Needless to say, ""Bella"" is on an actively steep learning curve and is quite capable of throwing the odd tantrum to get what she wants - and that is, initially, to go out and explore. Gradually more empowered, and a little more mature, she discovers the delights of the orgasm - and after that there's no stopping her. ""God"" tries to control her by suggesting a marriage to ""Max"" but he insists on such a fastidious contract that ""Duncan"" (Mark Ruffalo) concludes she must be worth investigating. He meets her and offers her her dreams, she convinces ""God"" to let her go with him and soon she is embarked on a trip around Europe enjoying the frequent delights of ""furious jumping""! The always learning woman soon tires of her beau, and realises that she can have loads of fun and earn at the same time - before ""God"" falls ill and she must return home to not just that life, but surprisingly to the one she thought she had left behind on the bridge. This film is genuinely laugh-out-loud at times, and the performance from Emma Stone has to be her best. She plays the almost porcelain-like and childish ""Bella"" when we meet her expertly, and that skill prevails as her character evolves into a savvy, street-smart and capable woman who quickly learns to fight fire with fire. Ruffalo is also on super form as her travelling companion and Kathryn Hunter also turns in a solid performance as her Parisian paymaster ""Swiney"". The narrative takes us on a fantastic tour of European cities, but also on a wonderfully evocative tour of humanity - warts and all. ""Bella"" has a practical and analytical mind that at times seems ludicrously detached, then somehow she ends up having got it right all along. It might look a bit long at just shy of 2½ hours but it really flies by and I couldn't help but feel sorry for the poor billy goat at the end of this creatively interpreted and very well adapted story of what were originally supposed to be Glaswegian hotspots!",2024-01-13T11:35:03.397Z,792307,4 stars,0.5585471987724304
r96sk,10.0,"Superb! It's quite the ride!

I don't have the film school-esque analysis to adequately describe all this, so I'll very much leave that to others. What I can note, though, is that I had a great time watching <em>'Poor Things'</em>. It's incredible. I have many a positive, though the main one is obvious: Emma Stone. All I can say is: Bravo! A truly outstanding performance!

Another major, major plus is the music. Wow! Sensational. It's so commanding throughout, blowing me away in what felt like every few minutes... and yet, it never distracts or takes you out from any scene unfolding onscreen. One of the greatest scores I've heard in a very long time. That aside, the visuals are amazing - from the colours to the sets, major props to all those behind the scenes. It all looks exquisite.

Stone isn't alone in impressing, as Willem Dafoe is brilliant too - loved his showing in this, the accent is particularly well fitting. Mark Ruffalo is praiseworthy too, as is everyone else to be honest - e.g. Ramy Youssef and Kathryn Hunter. They all partake in a quite bizarre plot, but one that is absolutely absorbing from beginning to conclusion.

Pre-watch I was somewhat expecting that this was going to be one of those (having not researched anything, as per) overly artsy flicks that I wouldn't connect with, delightfully I was totally wrong. I also felt, when Christopher Abbott's character appears, that the film should've ended earlier, though again I was incorrect because the film simply manages to continue at such a hugh quality.

BornKnight,9.0,"Fantasy drama- comedy adult film directed by Yorgos Lanthimos (The Killing of the Sacred Deer, The Lobster, The Favourite) and written by Tony McNamara (The Great, The Favorite, Cruella), being based on the 1992's novel by Alasdair Gray, that Lanthimos liked and even went to Scotland in 2009 to buy the direct of the movie.

Having a victorian semi-steampunk and exquisite atmosphere it tells the story of a newly created woman Bella Baxter, with her body reanimated by the eccentric surgeon Godwin Baxter, that discovering that after her suicide jumping a bridge she was pregnant, and uses the unborn fetus brain on her head.

After this she went on a journey from a Frankenstein character and develops her tastes and skills gradually till the end of the filme. I must say that some sexual scenes with Emma Stone and her character sexual appetite are most daring and shows how she grow as and actress in all aspect.

The main core of roles are Emma Stone as Bella Baxter, Mark Ruffalo as Duncan Wedderburn, Willem Dafoe as Dr. Godwin Baxter and as a lesser role Ramy Youssef as Max McCandles.

According to the cinematographer, Ryan Williams (American Honey, The Favorite) in conjunction with the director Lanthimos used an array of cameras, lens and films included Nikon, Angenieux Optimo and Zeiss Master Zooms, an ultra-wide PL-mount Optex 4mm fisheye, designed for 16mm/S16mm cinematography, that opens up to T2, plus antique 58mm and 85mm Petzvals. Ryan selected EASTMAN DOUBLE-X Black & White Negative Film 5222 for the movie's opening B&W sequences, KODAK EKTACHROME Color Reversal Film 100D 5294 for Bella's elopement and adventures with Wedderburn, and KODAK VISION3 500T Color Negative Film 5219 for the film's denouement.

The production design by Shona Heath	and James Price and the equip of art direction and prosthetics made and incredible job plus with the unique costume design by Holly Waddington (Lady MacBeth, Clash of Titans) also are striking, from the more bizarre childish dresses used on the start of the film to the more adut  on the end. All this with a modest budget of $35 million.

The movie have 11 Academy nominations for Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures (Original Score), Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Achievement in Directing, Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role, Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Achievement in Cinematography, Best Achievement in Film Editing, Best Achievement in Production Design, Best Achievement in Costume Design and  already have 11 BAFTA awards plus Venice Film Festival 2 awards, Golden Lion Best Film and Yorgos Lanthimos 2023 Winner UNIMED Award.

badelf,10.0,"**Poor Things: A Steampunk Symphony of Rebirth and Discovery**

From the moment Emma Stone appears on screen in Yorgos Lanthimos's ""_Poor Things_"", it's clear we're in for something extraordinary. Who knew Stone had such incredible comedic timing? Her portrayal of Bella Baxter is a revelation—a performance that transforms from infantile curiosity to nuanced self-discovery with remarkable precision.

Bella's character arc is nothing short of miraculous. Stone navigates Bella's developmental stages with such delicate complexity that you're simultaneously amused, uncomfortable, and deeply moved. From her initial childlike movements to her eventual sexual and intellectual awakening, she crafts a character who is both alien and profoundly human.

This is, without question, my favorite Yorgos Lanthimos film. His signature absurdist approach finds perfect harmony with this narrative, creating a world that's simultaneously grotesque and enchanting. The steampunk aesthetic is a delightful throwback to Jules Verne, with the Eiffel Tower establishing a precise historical context. The occasional use of 16mm lens work beautifully enhances this sensation, sometimes feeling like we're peering through a vintage camera obscura—creating an almost dreamlike quality that mirrors Bella's own perception.

The film's literary DNA is unmistakably Frankensteinian. The biographical parallels with Mary Shelley are both fascinating and intentional. Shelley, herself motherless after her mother's death in childbirth, seems to have inspired multiple layers of Bella's narrative. The fact that Shelley's half-sister, like Bella's mother, died by suicide adds another haunting dimension to the story.

The relationship between Bella and her creator, Dr. Godwin Baxter (brilliantly played by Willem Dafoe), is particularly poignant. Her calling him ""God"" is a multilayered reference—not just to Shelley's own father William Godwin, but a sly commentary on the act of creation itself. That heart-wrenching moment when the dying Godwin notes that Bella only ever looked at him with pure love is reminiscent of the monster and child scene in Boris Karloff's iconic 1931 Frankenstein—a tender echo of monstrosity and affection.

Lanthimos has crafted something truly unique: a feminist bildungsroman wrapped in science fiction, comedy, and philosophical inquiry. ""Poor Things"" isn't just a film; it's an experience that challenges our understanding of autonomy, identity, and what it means to truly come into one's self.",2024-12-12T02:22:55.979Z,792307,4 stars,0.4671601951122284
Dii_,-1.0,"I just watched it. I’d love to say I have no words because that’s what I believe many people feel, but because I love to analyze, I can find the exact words to describe this movie: an understanding, confusing, sorted chaos.
I might say that I love the director’s take on feminism—that’s the whole deal. A girl curious to become a woman of knowledge. She experiments, and as she grows, we see many artistic choices showing how Bella develops. Her growing hair, her walk style, and the use of color are all significant.
Max, in my opinion, is the definition of a good guy. He believes a woman can do anything she wants, and he won’t try to stop her. Eventually, she ends up with him—kind of. Strange, right? All those abusive men, like Duncan, who told her not to fall in love with him, eventually fell the hardest and went crazy because he couldn’t bear Bella’s choices. He couldn’t handle the fact that she chose to become a prostitute.
Understanding why Bella made such a decision was challenging at first, but then it all concluded that she was just curious or wanted to save the word. 
It’s amazing how prostitution is shown as something women use to escape difficult situations. Well done.
On the other hand, when Max wanted to marry Bella and knew she’d been with many men, he asked her to get tested, and she agreed. It’s that simple. 
Overall, I love the sound design. The music is incredibly well done, and I can’t say anything wrong about it. It always suited the situation and amplified her emotions even more.
The camera work was particularly good. I loved the zoom-ins and outs—it was fascinating because, in film school, they teach you not to do that, but the director saw a purpose in it.
This film breaks what we know about filmmaking today, even when you don’t realize it at first, and that’s the best part. This movie breaks the rules of filmmaking just as Bella breaks the rules of society.
As my last point, yes, it might seem explicit and chaotic, but that’s the image of the movie. If you really try, you’ll find answers to your questions—because not everything is served to you on a golden plate.
It’s a 10 out of 10 for me.",2024-12-28T23:06:36.439Z,792307,4 stars,0.28375330567359924

To do that, though, he needs a shop - and without a silver sovereign to his name that's not going to happen. It's winter, so his first order of business is somewhere to sleep. Luckily (?!?) ""Bleacher"" (Tom Davis) finds him on a cold bench and takes him to the welcoming arms of ""Mrs. Scrubbit"" (Olivia Colman) who offers him a bed for the night, though pretty soon he realises it's more of a bed in return for a life of indentured laundry servitude. Still, he's ingenious and he doesn't lose sight of his goal, so together with his fellow inmate ""Noodle"" (Calah Lane) and book-keeper ""Abacus Crunch"" (Jim Carter) they concoct a plan to addict the population to the young man's sweets whilst bringing down the evil trio of truffle terrorisers and ensuring ""Scrubbit"" and ""Bleacher' get their comeuppance too!. Meantime ""Wonka"" has other problem. Someone is pinching his product! An elaborate trap and a large jar introduce us to a tiny ""Oompa-Loompa"" (Hugh Grant) who looks like he's spent way too long on the sun-bed. With his own debt to pay, the two agree an alliance that - well we all know what happens to that. It's a little over-choreographed, I think, and the original songs are not especially memorable, but it doesn't hang about and there's no doubting that Chalamet is enjoying himself, and that's a little bit contagious and we head to a denouement that takes fondue to a ridiculous level... It features a strong and well matched ensemble cast and though maybe a little too long, I did enjoy it.",2023-12-11T11:10:25.698Z,787699,3 stars,0.5336531400680542
r96sk,8.0,"Enjoyed this!

2023's <em>'Wonka'</em> is very good! It's an original story based upon the Roald Dahl novel, so it isn't an adaptation as such like the 1971 and 2005 flicks. With that I didn't find it quite as interesting as what's portrayed in the aforementioned films, but I do appreciate (and prefer, tbh) that they went a different way with it here. And it comes out nicely.

Timothée Chalamet gives a strong performance in the lead role. Those behind Chalamet are entertaining, from Calah Lane to Keegan-Michael Key to the trio of Paterson Joseph, Matt Lucas and Mathew Baynton - the latter three's dance number for the Chief of Police near the beginning is amusing. The musical elements in general are solid.

Tom Davis and Olivia Colman are fun too. All characters played by those mentioned above after Lane could've easily have been extremely cringey, but thankfully I didn't find that to be the case for any of them at all - very well written, shown and cast in that regard.

Someone I have yet to mention is a certain someone as Lofty, an Oompa-Loompa. Hugh Grant is excellent as the orange-skinned, green-haired fellow, even if they did use Grant's best bits in the trailers; which I usually avoid due to those sort of (albeit minor) spoilers, but evidently failed to do so here.

All in all, I'd say this is a success. Credit to them for delivering, especially as I was kinda nonplussed by the already noted trailers (Grant aside).",2023-12-13T17:49:55.027Z,787699,4 stars,0.8373973369598389

""Wonka offers a fresh perspective on the iconic character while paying homage to Roald Dahl's timeless tale of morality.

Paul King succeeds in delivering a jolly, entertaining, visually dazzling take on the origins of Willy Wonka, featuring a fearlessly committed cast, tons of humor, and colorful, immersive technical achievements.

Despite the predictable, formulaic narrative lacking the same creativity of other filmmaking departments, it remains a sweet, harmonious, satisfying viewing experience that should be seen on the big screen.""

betterlikethat,-1.0,"**A Sweet Delight for All Ages - Wonka Movie Review**
I recently had the pleasure of watching the latest cinematic treat, Wonka, and I must say it's a delightful experience that caters to audiences of all ages. As a busy software engineer with a penchant for quality family time, I couldn't have asked for a better choice for our movie night.

From the moment the film began, it whisked us away on a whimsical journey into the magical world of Wonka's chocolate factory. The visual spectacle and attention to detail were captivating, and I found myself marveling at the creativity on screen. The vibrant colors and imaginative set designs truly brought the beloved story to life.

What sets Wonka apart is its ability to strike a perfect balance between nostalgia for those familiar with the classic tale and a fresh, modern twist that keeps the storyline engaging. The characters are charming, and the casting choices are spot-on. Timothee Chalamet as Wonka brings a new energy to the character, and his performance is both endearing and entertaining.

I came across this movie at :
https://mustwatchmovies.xyz/movie/114901/wonka

One aspect that stood out to me, as someone deeply involved in technology, was the seamless integration of CGI and practical effects. The visual effects team did a commendable job, creating a world that felt both magical and believable. The attention to detail, from the intricate machinery in the factory to the playful Oompa Loompas, was truly commendable.

Wonka is not just a feast for the eyes; it also delivers a heartwarming message about the importance of imagination, creativity, and the joy of shared experiences. As someone who manages an affiliate network and values family time, I can confidently recommend this movie for a fun-filled outing with loved ones.

In conclusion, Wonka is a cinematic delight that appeals to the child in all of us. Whether you're a parent looking for a wholesome family film or just someone who appreciates a well-crafted story, this movie is a must-see. Grab your tickets, some popcorn, and treat yourself to a heartwarming adventure that will leave you with a sweet taste of nostalgia.",2023-12-21T11:09:34.407Z,787699,4 stars,0.5091996788978577
farthington,-1.0,"Unfortunately, this movie fails marvelously. It has such incredible potential. The imagined prequel is consistent with Ronald Dahl's charm and wit. Timothee Chalamet’s performance was sensational. The supporting cast including Keegan Michael Keye, Patterson Joseph, Hugh Grant, Olivia Coleman and Jim Carter were all at their best.

The film falls short with the casting director's (Nina Gold's) attempt to find new talent in a novice actress named Calah Lane who stars in the movie opposite Timothee Chalamet as the character known as Noodle. The character itself is drawn well but the performance is so dreadful by Lane that it single-handedly destroys what could and should have been a classic prequel to Dahls original masterpiece. Lane throws out all her lines without any emotion and spends no time listening to her supporting cast. The writing becomes meaningless and almost immediately you do not find yourself caring about the Noodle character at all. This becomes quickly distracting to any audience member who has an inclination to invest in the story or other characters in the movie. The film completely dies and falls short on this one performance because the character of Noodle is drawn in such a way that her present and future well-being is central to the strength of the story's momentum.

One has to blame the casting director Nina Gold first. Nina Gold's work on projects like Bad Sisters, Game of Thrones and The Crown has been quite exceptional but in terms of finding new talent for this prospective cinema masterpiece just is not consistent with her previous achievements. I would also say that the failure of this film should also fall on Director Paul King's shoulders who also needs to bare the burden of this complete and utter disaster of a decision to put poor Calah Lane in this role and have all of us suffer this miserable performance and ultimately crushing blow to Roald Dahl's reputation as a storyteller and great wit.",2024-01-02T19:31:45.754Z,787699,2 stars,0.6085452437400818

Let me start by saying that this movie is truly amazing from start to finish. It stands out for its focus on a fantastic storyline without any political agenda, overly emphasized themes, or unnecessary controversies. Instead, it offers a captivating narrative, an exceptional cast, and outstanding music.

From the beginning, this movie is a delightful treat, filled with delicious surprises and exquisite chocolates. It brings the joy of craving candy, even though Willy Wonka's confectioneries are not widely available, adding to the allure.

While the film incorporates comedy, it strikes a balance, avoiding excessive cheesiness. The cast, including actors I initially doubted, delivers phenomenal performances throughout.

The emotional depth of Willy Wonka's character, from his childhood trauma to his aspirations for success, is portrayed with authenticity. The movie sheds light on his motivations for owning a chocolate factory, a detail not fully explored in previous adaptations.

Throughout the film, you'll find yourself laughing, smiling, and even shedding a few tears during the poignant moments. The charm and magic of the movie truly come alive on the big screen, making it a must-watch in theaters. Timothée Chalamet impresses with his acting and surprising singing abilities.

Similar to the original films, this adaptation strikes a balance between storytelling and musical numbers. The music enhances the narrative without overshadowing the plot, enriching the overall experience.

The iconic song sung by Chalamet towards the end of the movie evokes nostalgia and captures the essence of the Willy Wonka legacy, resonating with fans of all ages.

I highly recommend experiencing this film in theaters for the full cinematic experience. I eagerly anticipate a potential sequel exploring Willy Wonka's future, especially with Hugh Grant's rumored involvement as an Oompa Loompa.

So, grab your candy, settle in with your popcorn, and savor this excellent cinematic",2024-09-02T19:30:14.319Z,787699,4 stars,0.46314534544944763
MovieGuys,6.0,"This is a rather surprising film from Hong Kong director John Woo. 

Known for up beat, fast paced, gritty action films, Silent Night is a rather sombre, departure from what fans, like myself, have come to expect. 

The back story is rather sad and I feel this film dwells on this aspect to the point of ""almost"" becoming obsessively morose. I appreciate the key characters motivation is based on a tragic event but constantly re-visiting this aspect of the back story, tends to drag the film down emotionally, throwing bucket after bucket of cold water, on what is supposed to be an action romp.

Action sequences are well done, fight scenes and gun play of the predictable John Woo style. Its far from boring once it gets under way. 

In summary, watchable but for myself, a little too morose and sad, to really offer up a truly enjoyable action romp.",2023-12-22T22:39:22.216Z,891699,3 stars,0.6126776933670044
BornKnight,7.0,"First movie of John Woo in Hollywood since Paycheck in 2003 (that was an average movie). 

This movie is almost all based on the expression of the protagonist and secondary characters, even being previsible and a bit melodramatic (but the melodrama is dispersed thorough the movie), without any line whatsoever is something to be praised and offstream.

A father suffers the sudden loss of his son in a gangs shootout in a fictional city on Texas, and barely surviving trying to catch the killers - no explanation why he have those skills in the start of the story and in the end being all movie a preparation for revenge is a big no-no on the script thought.

But is enjoyable especially if you like revenge is better served cold movies. The tension is present and even being previsible the movie delivers the satisfaction of revenge in the end, building up tension till the end (I liked the final scene btw - it was something that was bothering me, and that little bit was explained [ I mean his reactions to the mother that suffered such a hard loss too ] ).

Being a John Woo movie you expect very electrifying action scenes and you get those on sequences on the start, middle and especially end as it should be.  Really nice and bloody btw - and for the acting of Joel Kinnaman as the only protagonist I decided to gave the movie one star more than it would be without him. 

So a 7.0 out 1f 10.0 / B for this one.

Pretty good. I was ok with the over the top slo mo drama action, I get that's the style, but where this movie lost me was in not setting up a remotely believable motivation for daddy becoming an overnight serial killer. The motivation of all the baddies is also non-existent. The first thing that really irritated me was that when he gets home after months of rehab and he's a clearly mentally damaged traumatized person, and his wife hasn't cleaned up the christmas tree and presents for the dead kid. WHAT? I get that she has her own trauma, but wtf, like, she's back at work and seemingly a functional person. The only way that makes sense is if she wanted him to be triggered, which we see later in her response to his psycho killer behaviour is clearly not the case. And then the whole pretense that no one really talks and there's no dialogue... I mean... it might make sense if he also lost his hearing. But he didn't.

Really enjoyed Kinnaman target shooting the hole for his face to peak through. The gang member clutching onto the top of Kinnaman's sick Mustang after being crushed and shot and then slowly sliding down the windshield with a comical blood smear sound, hilarious. Kinnaman barfs right after that and his barf looks super gross, all goopy and beige. Probably one of the most disgusting barf scenes ever set to film. Made me gag. Very convenient that the gang shootout happens at a location with a figure eight for Kinnaman to drive around, just like he trained for! Some of the car chase stuff was cool, but it was pretty silly when the cars formed into a car train and they were all shooting while moving along in a train. Choo choo! I think the most deranged and hilarious scene was when his dead son appears to him in the reflection of a hanging ornament with the wind-up toy melody playing and Kinnaman looks over and smiles while he is choking the gang leader to death. The movie closes with the mother visiting the son's grave, which by the way, has a toy train driving around the tombstone 24/7, and then the movie ends with what is essentially Kinnaman's revenge/suicide note scrolling across the screen.

""Napoleon contributes to a troubling trend in cinema, transforming significant historical narratives into hollow spectacles driven by mere visual entertainment.

Despite compelling performances and visually stunning battle set pieces, Ridley Scott fails to control the shockingly inconsistent tone, leading to abrupt shifts between heavy drama and spontaneous comedy. The dispassionate treatment of the millions who suffered through Napoleon's acts testifies to the dissonant messages of the movie, which ends with an unclear feeling about the status of its protagonist. Too much creative liberty leads to absurd historical inaccuracies, including a questionable lack of French accents and actors.

Despite efficient pacing, the 157-minute runtime surprisingly feels rushed, but I don't believe the rumored four-hour cut will fix so many massive problems...""

CinemaSerf,7.0,"I think this is one of those films, like his ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (2005) epic that Sir Ridley Scott has made for aficionados of grand scale historical cinema, not for historians. Indeed it may well be that for this film, the less you actually know about the subject the more you might enjoy it. We start with the demise of Marie Antoinette and see Napoleon Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix) watching from the baying crowd. He's a relatively junior officer but an aspirational one who manages to sell a plan to relieve the British occupied city of Toulon to his boss Barras (Tahar Rahim). This success sets him on a parabola that sees him rise, his falling in/out/in of love with the charismatic Josephine (Vanessa Kirby) and his overwhelming desire for European domination. The narrative clearly illustrates the fickleness of dynastic politics, trust and betrayal, love, lust and shrieking hypocrisy in a colourful and vibrant fashion. I didn't love Phoenix in this role, but maybe because Rod Steiger was so convincing in ""Waterloo"" (1970) that at times he looked a little like a mimic. That said, though, he puts his heart and soul into the role and the increasingly toxic dynamic with Kirby manages to stay on the right side of melodrama throughout. Again, as with Sir Ridley's tale of Jerusalem from eighteen years ago, he manages to pull off some spectacular battle scenes and the cinematography captures well the hostile environments - human and natural - faced by the soldiers as his empire building rose and fell. Although it's over 2½ hours long, I felt the focus was rather imbalanced. A long time spent on his rise to power then his decline and fall rather rushed. Dare I say it, but this might have worked better as a part one and a part two scenario. It looks stunning and the creative forces behind the costumes and visual effects are bound to be picking up a slew of gongs in due course. The acting, well that's less impressive and though I do enjoy the genre, I fear this may just end up being famed for some historical inaccuracies rather than being for an outstanding biopic of one of the world's most enigmatic and flawed megalomaniacs.",2023-11-24T09:18:02.000Z,753342,3 stars,0.5041633248329163
janeyee,3.0,"""Napoleon"" ambitiously sets out to condense the colossal life of the French emperor into a single film but ends up biting off more than it can chew. The movie, while visually stunning and energetically directed, suffers from an overly ambitious script and a plethora of historical inaccuracies that distract rather than enhance. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Napoleon is inconsistent, struggling to meld the complex dichotomy of the character's reputed brilliance and egotism with a more vulnerable, human side.

The film's pacing is erratic, attempting to navigate through two decades of dense European history and personal drama within a limited runtime. Key events feel rushed or underexplored, leaving viewers longing for the depth and development that a miniseries format could provide. Vanessa Kirby's Josephine provides a glimmer of intrigue and depth, yet even her story feels truncated and secondary to the hurried historical epic. Overall, ""Napoleon"" exemplifies a missed opportunity to deeply explore one of history's most enigmatic figures, hinting that a more expansive, serialized approach might have better served such a monumental story",2023-12-25T04:49:42.476Z,753342,2 stars,0.7587265372276306

It's just the film in general that disappointed. None of the non-battle scenes did anything for me, it's all so heavily forgettable. The added humour/quirkiness from the titular character felt out of place, or at least wasn't blended with the more serious stuff all that well.

The long run time, whilst certainly overdone, isn't actually all that much of a hindrance - it's moreso how poorly the run time is utilized. I, fwiw, have zero issue with historical inaccuracies.

MovieGuys,6.0,"I had high hopes for Napoleon but the final product was, for me, disappointing. 

Lets start by saying this feels more like a cinematic biography than sweeping saga. 

The approach taken is to move from set piece to set piece through the passage of this famous figures life. Regrettably, the handling, like  Napoleons tryst with Josephine, is quick and crude. Set piece gives way to yet more set pieces,with no real contextual cohesion. 

There are a number of historical inaccuracies too. The most glaring being the absence of a younger actor in the earlier part of Napoleons career.  This could have worked better with Joaquin Phoenix playing Napoleon in his latter years, married up to a actor of similar appearance, playing the younger Napoleon. Napoleon did change markedly over the years, why not take this approach?

I will say too, I think the American accent that's pretty hard to ignore, does not sit well, with a production set in this era.Brit accents are more believable because they were a well established presence on the world stage, at the time. I wasn't always sure if I was watching a film about Napoleon or Washington. A role I think Phoenix would be fabulous in, BTW.

This is not to say this film is ""all negatives"". A ton of money has been spent on this lavish production and it shows. Sets are amazing, as are costumes and locations. The gruesomeness of warfare be it domestic, Royalists dispatched by cannon in the streets of Paris or enemies on the battlefield, is laid bare. This really brings home the fact that warfare and imperialism, which we still see today, is ultimately an ugly, sinister, destructive thing. 

In summary, issues with the handling of this historical production are its biggest shortcoming. From the choice of approach, with almost obsessive set pieces, the use of an older actor in a younger role and other aspects of how the character is presented. 

On the upside, lavish and at times, brutally frank, especially the bloody spectacle of conflict. There are no hero's in war, including Napoleon himself.

NOTE: For anyone interested Napoleon was not short. He was around 5.7"" tall which was the male French average height for the century he was born in (height of people varied century to century based on factors like food availability). The reason people think he was short, was propaganda from his enemies. I guess propaganda does work, after all!",2024-01-12T05:06:21.670Z,753342,2 stars,0.6771760582923889
BornKnight,6.0,"Based on a screenplay by David Scarpa (that is writing the screenplay for Gladiator 2 too... oh oh) rather than a history book this is as epic as Ridley Scott makes his movies technically.... and that's it. After Ridley's Scott last movie (the magnificent and accurate ""The Duel"" of 2021) went under the radar on its year my expectation bar was set too high for this one.

I can't dismiss all technical work because I just love all Ridley Scott movies because of his singular style, and the movie is truly breathtaking in the major battles parts.

But as a whole it simplifies the real personality of the character (that Joaquin Phoenix plays) as a commander and personality of the time (maybe the most famous of that era) and minimizes the intrincancy of his relations with Empress Joséphine (played by Vanessa Kirby). Joaquin plays Napoleon role very well, even with the limitations of being just a caricature here.

The gaps and errors in historically accuracy and battle scenes tactics are just fathomless deep, and history is compressed as it where from a history book name and resume of chapter to another, loosing the chance to achieve something grandiose here. 

I can just dream on a well made screenplay and accurate movie here with the same quality of Ridley's work - nevertheless that it would take more than just one movie to get that chapter of Europe's history.

Maybe it will get one or two nominations at Academy for production, costume or cinematography here but that's it.

If it was a historical movie of a lesser known character or just focused on one part of his life it the score could be higher but here I just can get a 6.0 out of 10.0 / B - (but with a A for the technical side).

It seems thar a version with 92 plus minutes will be released on Apple, but without a final director's cut version date.",2024-01-15T20:32:49.683Z,753342,4 stars,0.4862220287322998

Brent Marchant,5.0,"When it comes to making what’s touted as being a grand, sweeping epic, a filmmaker had better have his or her ducks in a row before beginning. Unfortunately, in the case of director Ridley Scott’s latest, that’s only half true. This account of power-hungry 18th Century French emperor/dictator Napoleon Bonaparte (Joaquin Phoenix) does a fine job of getting the picture’s technical aspects down pat, with its excellent production design, costuming, makeup, cinematography and visual effects (especially in the well-orchestrated battle sequences, even if they border on the gratuitous at times). However, the film sorely misses the mark on virtually everything else. The biggest problem here is its poorly composed script, which provides almost no back story about the European politics of the day (both inside and outside of France), leaving viewers who know little about the period puzzled beyond belief. The screenplay is also weak on character development, portraying the autocrat as a monodimensional buffoon, someone whom it’s hard to believe could have accomplished so much (for what it’s worth) by being a loutish dolt. And then there’s Phoenix’s hammy overacting, coming across like a tantrum-prone spoiled little kid than a head of state. It could be that tactic was intentional, perhaps to make a statement about the current political climate and one of its chief players, but falling back on ambition alone as a defining character trait is overly simplistic, even if it’s meant to resonate symbolically. In light of the foregoing, it seems like this project could have used some more in-depth development beyond its production aspects, and perhaps the best way to accomplish that would have been to expand the scope of the story. At a current runtime of 2:41:00, though, the only way to realistically achieve that would have been to grow the story by at least another hour, which means that this venture would likely have worked better as a miniseries than a standalone film. It’s rare for director Scott to drop the ball as much as he has with this offering, but I suppose it’s not too surprising when it comes to tackling something as big as this, an epic that ends up being anything but.",2024-03-09T04:21:36.170Z,753342,2 stars,0.5673616528511047
Manuel São Bento,7.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/leave-the-world-behind-review-a-thought-provoking-psychological-study-on-humanity/

""Leave the World Behind intricately intertwines Sam Esmail's directorial finesse with Rumaan Alam's thought-provoking source material, delivering a compelling exploration of familial dynamics, societal issues, and the impact of fear and uncertainty on human behavior.

While Esmail's adaptation steers towards a more straightforward apocalyptic thriller, it retains thematic depth, as the layered characters, portrayed by a stellar ensemble cast with Julia Roberts and Mahershala Ali as brilliant standouts, serve as compelling conduits for these themes, offering nuanced reflections on contemporary society. Exquisite cinematography and a pulsating score contribute to a tense, immersive experience, despite occasionally distracting camera work, minor pacing issues, and repetitive narrative elements.

In the end, it's a profoundly interesting cautionary tale that everyone should see before the year's end.""

Brent Marchant,7.0,"What would you do if you suddenly began experiencing a series of anomalous, apocalyptic-style events? With communications crippled and transportation severely hampered, it’s impossible to figure out what’s happening or how to formulate a feasible exit strategy. Yet, as all this is unfolding, the troubling and unexplained events continue unabated. Now what? Such is the chilling experience of an upscale New York City couple and their two children who unwittingly wind up sharing a luxurious Long Island vacation home with the wealthy property owner and his adult daughter in the midst of all this chaos. As they struggle to determine what’s transpiring, they come upon revelations about themselves, one another and the world at large, which clearly is not everything it appears or has been made out to be. The result is a creepy but astute cautionary tale, one we’d be wise to heed given current sociopolitical trends and prevailing conditions. While director Sam Esmail's second feature outing generally manages to maintain a certain edge-of-the-seat quality, it could nevertheless stand to use some trimming to pick up the pace in spots, especially in several instances where the dialogue becomes strained and in others where the narrative veers into needlessly and cryptically stringing viewers along from one enigmatic event to another. In addition, while I am certainly no prude when it comes to off-color language, the screenplay contains a surprisingly inordinate number of f-bombs, a script device that seems decidedly inappropriate, often out of place and vastly overused. The picture makes up for this with a fine ensemble cast, particularly in the performances of Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke and Kevin Bacon, as well as some intriguing cinematography, though the film’s inconsistent soundtrack/score doesn’t always work as well as it could have. “Leave the World Behind” truly comes across as a sincere effort at telling a compelling, suspenseful and enlightening tale, but it doesn’t always get all of the components right. That doesn’t mean it’s not worth watching, but the term “cautionary tale” is certainly apropos in describing more than just its insightful content.",2023-12-09T04:45:22.689Z,726209,2 stars,0.4148119390010834
BornKnight,7.0,"Psychological thriller film written, directed and produced by Sam Esmail (Mr. Robot Series), based on the 2020 novel of the same name by Rumaan Alam, with some alterations in the screenplay.

First of all what called my attention was the Obama's interest in the movie that is explained by a-) He is a huge fan of the book; a-) Obviously as an ex-president he had insight into the military parts;

To those who don't know what to expect about the movie I can call it a mix of M. Night Shyamalan and Jordan Pelee with the obvious personal touch of the director based by the social-technologic chaos that we seen in Mr. Robot. Btw this was the fact that gave in most of the story to me well in the start of the movie events.

The movie basically tells what happens when a up-mid class white family goes into vacations into a Airbnb upstate NY high-class house for vacations and strange events like an oil tanker losing control and crashing into beach (hmmmm let me guess... no GPS?) and internet stops unexpectedly (hmmm let me guess cyberattacks? coup d'etat by unknow enemies????) and wild life starts to act strangely, like deer and birds (this is the MNS part, probably because of some sort of disruptive effect that I suspect in the start to be a solar flare until it mentioned only in US when I kill'd the movie plot).

The comes the J. Pelee part when a black father and daughter shows up in the house after the strange effects telling they are the ones that own the house and came back for retreat of the chaos. Yeah racial tension on.

Individually all characters have their little details of psychology and backstory which is a nice touch and well done part of the movie. And so are the acting.

I guess that my main problem is watching too much stuff - there is a point that to get a movie that introduce something unique to you, specially knowing the background of the directors and writers is something difficult to impress yourself.

Out of these plot parts the movie have some cool paranoid ideas (that actually aren't so paranoid because they would work as in the movie like Obama were advised) and a very nice soundtrack by Mac Quayle (Mr Robot, American Horror Story) and cinematography with some cool and interesting cameras shots by Tod Campbell (Stranger Things, Mr Robot, Boyhood).

Overall it isn't a bad movie - on contraire it is interesting if you don't know what to expect. Not bad, but the racial part was unnecessary imo. Even so, for me it is one of the good movies of 2023 so it win a heart too.

My score: 7.5 out of 10 / B+.",2023-12-11T02:03:22.218Z,726209,3 stars,0.5488935112953186

MovieGuys,5.0,"I'm amazed by the positive reviews this one is receiving. 

For me, Leave the World Behind, feels like a stew of half baked conspiracy theories and stereotypes of modern Westerners, set against a politely  apocalyptic, backdrop. People are lazy, apathetic, paranoid, indulgent and ultimately, divided, even at the end. 

This may be partly true but I don't think its in any way broadly representative of humanity. Perhaps, in truth, it reflects an elite view of ordinary people, they themselves don't really know and just as tellingly, understand? Suffice to say, I can only speculate.....

Its unsurprising then, that the ending to this tale has no real punch. I feel this is due to what I would characterise as general lack of awareness in this film, that can only lead to a meek conclusion. 

Are there any positives here? Well the acting is decent if unremarkable. The  more surreal scenes, such as automated, driver less, Tesla's piling up like crisp white cardboard, is, on a certain level, captivating.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"I don't know if maybe ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" (2018) or ""Rocketman"" (2019) have made me a bit immune to the rather hedonistic lifestyles of the musical rich and famous, but I found this beautifully photographed depiction of the life of the enigmatic Leonard Bernstein to be remarkably tame. The monochrome presentation is glorious to look at, but the narrative is weak, I found. Carey Mullian, his long-suffering wife Felicia Montealegre is easily the most meritorious of praise here. She portrays the increasingly frustrated, betrayed yet still loving woman with a strength and subtlety that is really engaging - especially towards the end of the film. Cooper, on the other hand - well, was he meant to be mimicking Barry Manilow or Tony Bennett? We learn very little about what made the man tick, about what made his sexuality such a big deal for him? The other characters come and go with little context to illustrate their roles in his life, his role in their's and with the possible exception of their eldest daughter Shirley (Sarah Silverman) there is no conversation to be had about just how this marriage of convenience was established or managed. It's also largely devoid of his most famous musical works. Aside from the tiniest interlude from ""West Side Story"" - which I know he didn't much care for - we could be forgiven for assuming that this was a biopic of a composer with high-brow classical aspirations but with little popular appeal. That said, there is a splendid rendition of Mahler's 2nd from the acoustically gorgeous Ely cathedral to savour, but otherwise this is all a rather underwhelming melodrama that really didn't tell me much that I didn't already know about this charismatic, selfish and flawed individual the fluctuating state of whose marriage was, frankly, of very little interest to me. More marital woes than maestro, sorry.",2023-12-05T15:38:53.094Z,523607,2 stars,0.50049889087677
Brent Marchant,5.0,"A great talent deserves a great biopic. Regrettably, in the case of the late conductor/composer/musician Leonard Bernstein, he doesn’t get it. Writer-actor-director Bradley Cooper has made a film that I’m sure he thinks of as his cinematic masterpiece when, in fact, it comes across more like a tribute to the filmmaker’s own ego than as an homage to his subject. Perhaps the biggest problem here is the screenplay, which can never really decide if it wants to be a litany of the accomplishments of the artist (Cooper) or a love story between him and his adoring wife, Felicia (Carey Mulligan). The constant switching back and forth between the two leaves viewers wondering which will be the focus that the director settles on. Then there’s Cooper’s increasingly hammy overacting, which grows progressively annoying as the film plays out, a performance riddled with knowing looks of “I know I’m going to get awards nominations for this portrayal.” Add to that a somewhat inexplicable shift from monochrome to color cinematography, and audiences are left further pondering the filmmaker’s cinematic motivations while simultaneously having to contend with notably underdeveloped depictions of the character’s motivations, making for a rather shallow take overall when it comes to exploring the protagonist’s nature. To its credit, “Maestro” features a fine production design and gorgeous camera work (especially in the black-and-white sequences), and Mulligan’s luminescent presence is positively captivating, in my view the only real reason for screening this offering in the first place. Otherwise, however, this is a big awards season disappointment that leaves much to be desired – and that likely would have been better off left in the hands of the project’s originally designated director, Steven Spielberg. Cooper may be a fine actor, but that’s what he should stick with, as that’s where his real strength lies – not behind the camera or sitting in the writer’s chair.",2023-12-25T20:31:59.906Z,523607,3 stars,0.41518402099609375
BornKnight,7.0,"This biographical movie about Leonard Bernstein is directed and written by Bradley Cooper (and Josh Singer - “Spotlight”) and produced between others by Martin Scorsese (that declined to direct it after seeing “A Star is Born” and to be able to film the Irishman) and Steven Spielberg.

It stars Bradley Cooper as Leonard Bernstein an Jew American conductor and composer (1918–1990) and Carey Mulligan as Felicia Montealegre Bernstein
American actress (1922–1978) who married Lenny in 1951, by social convenience of that epoch. 

Leonard Bernstein had a brilliant career playing in Broadway (West Side Story is by him), Carnegie Hall and New York Philharmonic and had also an intense career on teaching, having intense presentations that showed his true love for music - it was also a controverse person, with a very active social live and gay. Not shown in the movie, that he holds a cigar in almost every scene we had asthma (being dismissed in WWII) developed emphysema, dying from a heart attack from a mesothelioma tumor.

Felicia Montealegre Bernstein was a Jew actress from Chilean origins that met Leonard while at a party in 1946 - it was also a true love into Leonard's life, even with his sexual orientation, living a sometimes contributed second life.

The story of the movie show marks at the live on the musician, and the cinematography by

Also the scenes of the movie that place great emphasis depending on the dramatic moment - from dialogues and close ups, to discussions and background happenings to the magnificent performances of Bradley Cooper as Leny as maestro, including a memorable scene at a church.

The edition of the movie by Michelle Tesoro (The Queen's Gambit) is very well done, and 
the music is all works of Leonard Bernstein (not sure if it can be a contender of this year's Academy nominations). Another remarkable work is the 

The movie can be another one of NF gems that comes to the oscar consolidating streaming as a real parallel form of art to classic cinema - I can foresee and nomination to best actor, best co-adjuvant actress, best cinematography and maybe on production, because the makeup and prosthetic work of Kazu Hiro is just amazing life-like, and true to both the physical and psychological side of Leny.

The story of the movie itself could be better in showing better the intimacy between the two, and also some facts left aside as the work of both of them as fierce activists for several causes. The story rhythm is also a bit confuse as it make jumps to the relevant points and do not stay till the end of something predictable but lingering and meaningful (as Felicica’s death, show only as a son running to the backyard the moving of the family from the house)

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Though it's very formulaic, this film, it's still at the better end of recent gore-fests. We start off with the most unlikely of scenarios - a Thanksgiving sale at a supermarket that goes spectacularly and violently wrong. The population of the founding father's very own Plymouth in Massachusetts become frenetic and determined to do whatever it takes to get into this store and get their free waffle iron! Anyway, a group of kids manage to sneak in first and provoke the waiting crowd - that leads to a stampede with tragic results. Scoot on twelve months and the same store is proposing to have anther such sale, despite the fatalities last time round that led to no prosecutions thanks to some security camera ""errors"". Sheriff ""Eric"" (Patrick Dempsey) is concerned for public safety but that's just the start of his woes. When the rather odious and foul mouthed waitress ""Lizzie"" (Amanda Barker) is found - well half of her is found - stuck to the store's illuminated signage, he must find the culprit before there are even more revenge attacks by the masked pilgrim... Yes, we've seen this all before but here Eli Roth takes a cast that might have been graduates from Ben Platt's ""Theater Camp"" (2023) and turns them into prey for a menacing killer who certainly has some imagination when reeking his havoc on those who did him wrong. It takes a swipe at the commercial culture around this American holiday - rather well presented via Rick Hoffman's store-owning ""Thomas"", father or our lead ""Jessica"" (Nell Verlaque) and husband to the really rather shallow ""Kathleen"" (Karen Cliche). There's a bit of boyfriend rivalry that accidentally displays the versatility (?!) of Milo Manheim who quite successfully ditches his butter wouldn't melt image (anyone seen ""Journey to Bethlehem""?) before a suitably far-fetched denouement that does take it's time, repeats itself a bit and concludes screaming sequel.

RalphRahal,7.0,"Eli Roth’s Thanksgiving is exactly what you’d expect from the director of Hostel; gory, outrageous, and packed with shocking kills. It’s a fun and bloody holiday slasher that’s entertaining enough if you enjoy Roth’s over-the-top style. The premise of a Thanksgiving-themed horror movie is a great idea, and the film delivers on some of that promise with creative kills and moments of real tension.

However, the movie doesn’t fully capitalize on its potential. For a concept like this, there was so much room to explore the holiday theme in clever and twisted ways, but it only skims the surface. Add to that a script that feels a bit weak and acting that’s hit or miss, and the movie doesn’t quite hit the heights it could have. While the gore and spectacle are solid, the lack of deeper characters and smarter writing makes it feel more like a fun distraction than something truly memorable.

Both are at Oxford university, but the former man is very much a poor relation of his well-heeled contemporaries. One afternoon, though, he comes to the aid of ""Felix"" lending him his bike, and what now ensues is a friendship that sees the two gradually start to bond and for the latter to invite his new friend to his eponymous stately pile as a guest of his mother (Rosamund Pike) and father (Richard E. Grant). Tagging along throughout this experience is the slightly malevolent and jealous ""Farleigh"" (Archie Madekwe) as their summer vacillates from the hedonistic and enjoyable to the ghastly and tragic. It's a bit of a slow starter, but once we arrive at the ancestral pile the story starts to gather pace and ""Ollie"" proves to be quite adept at navigating - even manipulating - the frequently quite treacherous environment in which he finds himself. It is definitely too dialogue heavy, but Keoghan is good here and there is quite an effectively building degree of menace as we start to realise that maybe things aren't all quite what they seem. I found Madekwe also rather good as the odious hanger-on (only a posher one) and Carey Mulligan walks quite a characterful tightrope too. The photography and aesthetic of the film along with Anthony Willis's score all add a degree of richness to a story that isn't as derivative as I feared. I can't think it's a film I will remember in a few years, but it is well worth a watch as Mr Keoghan continues on his journey to what must be greater success.",2023-10-08T06:08:40.929Z,930564,4 stars,0.6219910383224487
Brent Marchant,3.0,"Sometimes you come across a filmmaker whose works you just don’t like. And now, after two features in, I can honestly say that about writer-director Emerald Fennell. I didn’t care much for her debut outing, “Promising Young Woman” (2020), and I can say the same (and more) about her follow-up effort, “Saltburn.” This alleged thriller about a seemingly awkward but quietly sinister Oxford student (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into a family of wealthy English aristocrats features a story and characters about whom, quite frankly, I couldn’t care less. (Think “The Killing of a Sacred Deer” (2017) with a cast of eccentric old money cronies and a wolf in sheep’s clothing.) This assemblage of utterly reprehensible characters living utterly reprehensible lives and zealously adhering to utterly reprehensible values fails to engender viewer empathy, interest or even connection. Much of the narrative is predictable and glacially paced, incorporates sequences that are included for little more than forced shock value, features monodimensional and blatantly obvious (almost trite) character development, and frequently stumbles in attempts at humor that are wedged in largely for the sake of convenience or calculatedly timed comic relief. It’s the kind of picture that prompts regular looks at one’s watch to see how much more one must endure and delivers welcome sighs of relief when the end finally comes. What’s more, given the combined talent pool for this production, it’s a genuine shame to see the likes of Rosamund Pike, Carey Mulligan and Richard E. Grant relegated to supporting roles in which their abilities are sorely underused. And then there’s the excessively hammy performance of Keoghan, who’s quite obviously (and knowingly) acting and not disappearing into the bona fide portrayal of a character. In all, this offering feels like a picture that tries awfully hard to see how much it can get away with, especially when seeking to invoke dropped jaws among audience members, much as this director’s cinematic predecessor attempted to do. Save your money, and don’t waste your time on this vastly overrated release from a vastly overrated filmmaker.",2023-12-09T23:48:42.237Z,930564,1 star,0.460714727640152

BornKnight,8.0,"Black comedy / psychological drama of Amazon, directed and written by 
Emerald Fennell (from the magnificent promising Young Woman and Barbie). This one is a bit tricky one to review without spoilers so if want to see the review stop right here.

It tells a story about the scholarship student Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) early in the 2000 that struggle to be accepted into the high class Oxford University. He manages to met Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi) a popular student and befriends it being closer and closer in friendship with him, till he shares his sad family story background. Then he is invited to be at vacations at Saltburn, an magnificent summer place in the fields of England where he meets the eccentric and decadent family of Felix, Rosamund Pike (Lady Elspeth Catton, Felix's mother), Richard E. Grant (as Sir James Catton, Felix's father), Alison Oliver (as Venetia Catton, Felix's sister) and Archie Madekwe (as Farleigh Start, Felix's annoying cousin).

With a solid production structure with cinematography by Linus Sandgren (I must highlight this one how it works adjusting to the mood of the unfolding story), edition by Victoria Boydell and music by
Anthony Willis, the movie have it greatest merit in an area that Fennel already showed before - the script. 

Simplifying all things the story that have some sordid sex scenes and gives hints that Ollie isn't so nice in the head as he seems, it develops almost like Promising Young Woman, to a revelling ending of a serial killer and social alpinist in the last 30min of the movie. Not something that we wouldn't foresee by the attitudes of the protagonist and background of the director / writer but nice anyway. So much that seems that I enjoyed it more than most of the people I follow.  

Guess that we maybe have another contender for Academy nomination of screenplay, director and acting here. A Solid 7.9 out of 10.0 / B+ here.",2024-01-02T01:32:21.125Z,930564,4 stars,0.6720191240310669
Amin,8.0,"**It's been a long while since I stumbled upon a film that wasn't painfully predictable.** 

What struck me the most was this bizarre yet fascinating connection I developed with a psychopath. It sounds odd, but the film masterfully reels you into this vortex of the character's emotions and psyche. And then, somewhere along the line, it cleverly severed this connection, leaving me... adrift.
However, what really resonated with me was the cinematography. The camera work, grading, lighting – everything seemed meticulously crafted to enhance the narrative and the mood of the film. There were moments where I was simply awe-struck by the beauty of a single shot.

r96sk,9.0,"I'm disturbed. Outstandingly disturbed, mind you.

It is very out there as it features some uncomfortable moments, but that's never a bad thing if it's done right... and boy is it here. The film does an excellent job at making it all fit, which is actually quite impressive. Main plot-wise, it's not a hard one to predict... or at least not quite as unpredictable as the film possibly thinks it is based on the 'reveals' (?) at the end, but again: never a bad thing if done correctly. The main takeaway from all this is certainly the unsettling stuff.

This 2023 production also holds fantastic cast performances. Barry Keoghan is top notch, I've seen various people online rave about him as an actor but I hadn't really seen it until now. Jacob Elordi merits praise too, as does Rosamund Pike - another one I haven't previously been too keen on, though she is fun here. In fact, on paper it's an iffy cast to me. In reality, the cast are perfect. Credit also to Richard E. Grant, Alison Oliver and Archie Madekwe.

No doubt, <em>'Saltburn'</em> is a great movie! A must-watch, I'd say.

Then having heard some hype I couldn't see how it could be rated 15. But you know how in films, people would kiss, then suddenly be lying in bed smoking; as adults, we’ve been there, and we know they’ve just had sex, but how could a censor or anyone argue with what was actually shown. If you watch ‘The Good Place’ or ‘The Simpsons’, there are parts where you laugh along with the writers but you know it’ll go over kids’ heads. This was definitely a 15 in what it showed but I blushed at what was inferred. Having heard of ‘the bath scene’ or the ‘graveyard scene’, I was concerned, and more surprised by the 'vampire' scene and that the necrophilia actually occurred elsewhere.

Lachlan Thiele,8.0,"<b>INT. MOCKING-MOORE - DAY </b>

May December is an excellent satire with incredibly dark themes at times. Portman's Elizabeth is an actress tasked with researching her next role, a movie based on the massively dramatised life of <i>Julianne Moore's</i> character. Moore and Portman shine in their roles, and both can create believable characters whilst still pushing the unbelievable humour and situations they are put in. Portman, mainly with her fascination with making an actual 'true-to-life' performance as <i>Gracie</i>, copies her quirks and tendencies, providing the audience with laughs. 
Primarily the humour lies in the dark aspects of the film. The funniest, without spoiling, Gracie's relationship with her husband. It continuously evolves over the film, and we finally reach a satisfying conclusion. It's interesting how the comedy-drama has the best character arcs out of all of the dramas that premiered at Cannes. 
Overall, <i>May December</i> lands on both feet, standing tall against the competition. Satirical, well-acted and entertaining.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"This actually reminded me a little of ""All About Eve"" (1950) as television actress ""Elizabeth"" (Natalie Portman) arrives at the home of ""Gracie"" (Julianne Moore) about whom she is to star in a biopic. Initially welcoming of her and keen to help, we follow the changing dynamic as we learn that ""Gracie"" has quite a past, and that her husband of 20-odd years, ""Joe"" (Charles Melton) is considerably younger than her and there was quite a furore when they first hooked up that saw the older woman incarcerated. The more she finds out, the more involved ""Elizabeth"" becomes and the more immersed we all become in this quite compelling story of a taboo that rather broke a mould or two and is now surrounded by an atmosphere of hypocrisy, faux-friendships, and lemon drizzle cake. There is a strong, increasingly well delivered, competitiveness between these two women and Melton delivers quite strongly too as the young man who seems devoid of much purpose as he heads towards his forties. The script is quite tight, frequently potent and Todd Haynes's overall style of intimate direction genuinely encourages us to invest a little in one of the women - I didn't manage to invest in both, especially as the denouement loomed (perhaps just a little predictably). This film quite successfully presents us with quite an interesting character study that works both ways in their relationship - and is well worth a watch.",2023-10-19T17:13:36.172Z,839369,4 stars,0.7016645073890686
Brent Marchant,5.0,"In moviemaking, there’s subtlety, and then there’s subtlety carried too far. In the case of director Todd Haynes’s latest, the filmmaker unfortunately indulges himself far too much in the latter. This story of an actress (Natalie Portman) who visits a middle-aged sex offender (Julianne Moore) to prepare for a role she’s about to play in a movie about her subject’s life never seems to find a footing to stick with and explore. The narrative examines many different aspects of the back story behind the lives of the characters to be portrayed in this pending production without ever really resolving any of them by the time the credits roll. This includes not only the protagonist’s reasons for pursuing her once-underage husband (Charles Melton) – actions that got her jailed and made her fodder for countless tawdry tabloid cover stories – but also the nature of the actress’s real motivations in conducting such an excessively intense in-depth study of her character. In the process, virtually everyone comes across as somewhat unsavory, and, considering that the truth is never clearly revealed about any of them, it begs the question, why should we care about any of this? The film depicts all of this so subtly that it goes beyond nuance, veering into the realm of enigmatic, thereby further reinforcing the notion of why any of us should care. Ironically, these underplayed elements are in stark contrast to some rather obvious (and terribly trite) symbolism, particularly in images related to themes of transition and transformation. The picture’s inconsistent changes in tone don’t help, either, vacillating between allegedly serious drama and a seemingly underdeveloped desire to break out as an exercise in full-fledged camp (which, by the way, probably would have made this a much better offering). The script’s meandering flow and glacial pacing also don’t help, leaving viewers scratching their heads more often than not as to where this story is headed. In the end, all of the foregoing is ultimately quite unfortunate, because there’s definite potential in this project, but it’s never adequately defined and fleshed out. Leads Moore and (especially) Portman turn in admirable efforts to make this material fly, but they simply don’t have enough to work with to make that happen. While there appear to be allusions to themes like the difficulty involved in dealing with long-buried feelings and the fact that we may never be able to adequately grasp the truth behind them (either as outsiders looking in or as active participants in the midst of such dealings), the cryptic handling of those ideas undermines whatever meaningful messages or cinematic value they might have, making all of this seem like just such a big waste of time. Director Haynes has an impressive filmography behind him with such releases as “Poison” (1991), “Far From Heaven” (2002) and “Dark Waters” (2019), but, regrettably, “May December” certainly can’t be counted as part of that list.",2023-11-24T16:48:27.272Z,839369,2 stars,0.5262870192527771
r96sk,7.0,"Bit of a odd one. It gradually lost my attention a little the longer it went on, though overall it's a film I'd consider as interesting.

I know of the real life story that <em>'May December'</em> is ""loosely"" based upon, so it was intriguing early on to see how the film was going to tackle it. I think they did a good enough job with it all, the actress meeting the subject element makes the film more watchable than it otherwise would have been.

Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore and Charles Melton are a great trio onscreen, each giving a noteworthy performance. Portman impressed me most, though Melton really does come strong across the second part of the movie. The rest of the cast do well, particularly solid casting of the main two characters' children.

A very well made production, just one that did lose me slightly as it headed through its near 2hr run time - could've been shorter, imo.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"If you've seen ""12 Mighty Orphans"" (2021) or ""The Shiny Shrimps"" (2019) then you'll know what to expect as Taika Waititi takes the same template and applies it to football. Here it's the adequate Michael Fassbender who gets to portray the down on his luck coach (Thomas Rongen) in this factually based story. He's not much good at his job and is temperamentally a bit unreliable, so is dispatched to coach what is officially the world's worst team. American Samoa, still smarting from a 31-0 thumping at the hands of the ever so slightly more populated Australia, has a team whose viability is under scrutiny by the parent American Federation. Can Rongen turn things around? His team are the traditionally disparate group of well-meaning, distinctly amateur, enthusiasts. Unused to any concept of team playing, co-ordination and/or training - and their new boss's predilection for a bottle or two doesn't suggest change is going to come anytime soon. Local federation boss Tavita (Oscar Kightley) manages to inspire though - and what happens now is all rather predictable, but engagingly portrayed, as the team start to realise that defeat each time is not as inevitable as they might expect. It does present us with quite an interesting look at Polynesian attitudes - ones of compassion, fairness and tolerance. Winning is important, but it's not the be all and end all; and the eventual make up of their team - and it's constituent parts - is testament to a society that has way more right than it has wrong in the way it thinks and behaves. There's loads of humour - most of which comes from an on-form Kightley, but I found that a bit weak and just a little too stereotypical (albeit from their perspective rather than the American's). The best bits are probably in the trailers, but it's still just about worth a watch - but the television will be fine.",2023-12-30T08:20:40.163Z,621587,3 stars,0.5475093722343445
r96sk,6.0,"The last chunk of the film saves it somewhat, prior to that <em>'Next Goal Wins'</em> is quite poor.

I like Taika Waititi and usually dig his humour a lot, but here his comedy put into the flick just isn't all that amusing annoyingly. I'm a big football fan so knew of the real life story that this is based upon, though even as such it kinda sits in the middle of being for sports fans and being for the average moviegoer... without really committing to either, at least that's how it felt to me; it's not comedic enough or sporty enough.

I found everything until the scene with a smiley face on the whiteboard to be real lame, like nothing I was watching was entertaining me... kinda cringey, if anything. A lot of the humour up to that moment felt forced, in fact the only parts that got a chuckle out of me were the white guy jokes. Michael Fassbender isn't any good up to that point, either.

Thankfully, the conclusion is fairly feel-good and does wrap things up well - to the point it gets an extra notch up with my rating. As noted I found Fassbender average, at best... Liam Neeson might've been a better cast, especially given they allude to a past role of the Northern Irishman's at one moment. Away from the lead, other cast members do do decent - namely Oscar Kightley, Kaimana and David Fane.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"I couldn't help wondering if Francis Lawrence had just asked for that ""Tom fella..."" ""You know..."" The casting director didn't realise he meant that ""Tom fella"" from ""Harry Potter"" and got Tom Blyth instead. There's an uncanny resemblance with the blonde floppy hair and the rather linear facial expressions. Indeed, despite a promising (if frustrating) shower scene at the top of the film, Blyth (""Coryo"") is really what drags this otherwise quite decent action adventure film down. Rachel Zegler, on the other hand, is full of enthusiasm as her ""Lucy Gray"" character is selected to fight for District 12 in the ""Hunger Games"". Meantime, ""Dean Highbottom"" (the infrequently used Peter Dinklage) has come up with a way to spike the dwindling television ratings. He has decided to allocate one of his top students to mentor each of the captives. Yep - ""Coryo"" is put with ""Lucy Gray"". A bit of sabotage changes the nature of the game and gradually our hero starts to wonder if he is on the right side - especially when he becomes a little too emotionally involved with his protégé and attracts the enmity of his own erstwhile mentor. Luckily, the whole scenario is being overseen by the hammily menacing ""Volumnia Gaul"" (Viola Davis) who is clearly having a ball with industrial scale make up and a barrel of genetically modified snakes. The last twenty minutes smacks a little too much of sequel building, but this film has plenty of action and intrigue, loads of back-stabbing and just a little moralising. Zegler delivers a few folky style ballads confidently and generally does a lively enough job keeping it quite a bit better than I was expecting. It needs a cinema, though - the grand scale effects and photography work best that way. On the television it will probably just come across as a bit derivative.",2023-11-23T09:26:33.405Z,695721,3 stars,0.5189571380615234

Imon Reza,-1.0,"With its heartbreaking origin story that depicts the fall of President Snow, **The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes** is the ideal masterpiece of a frightening origin story collection. The adaptation of the novel to the movie was done so well that it is really remarkable. A very high quality cinematography is present.  Rachel Zegler is the personification of Lucy Gray, while Tom Blyth is a leading man. 

What an amazing experience it was! The whole auditorium was sitting on the edge of their seats, completely silent, and just appreciating the movie. Everything in the film was flawless, including the narrative, the acting, the music, and the allusions.

In the first place, I feel it is necessary to offer my daughter, Rachel Zegler, some praise. Her performance as Lucy Gray gave the impression that she had actually torn her off the page. Rachel did a wonderful job of portraying Lucy Gray, who was the epitome of perfection, and I don't believe anybody else could have achieved the same level of success. Rachel's singing is even more incredible than her acting, by a significant margin. It is common knowledge that Rachel is an incredible vocalist, but the way she sings in this film leaves me feeling as if I had never heard her voice before. She is such a powerhouse of an actor, and I am so thrilled to watch her succeed in this production. The fact that she sang everything live on set is another reason why I am so proud of her. In my view, this is without a doubt her finest performance so far. 

Following that, I feel compelled to call attention to the outstanding performance that Tom Blyth gave as Snow. He did a fantastic job of taking what Donald Sutherland had done with the role and giving it his own spin while still making it his own interpretation of the character. On Snow, Tom was able to bring out both the charming and the insane aspects of her personality. I found his acting to be particularly noteworthy in the third act of the movie, particularly the moment in which he was seen in the woods with Lucy Gray. The manner in which Tom was able to incorporate everything of Snow's inner monologue that is shown to us in the novel into his facial expressions was absolutely stunning. He did an excellent job in this function. 

When it comes to this film, there are a lot of other things that I could simply enthuse about. Every single one of the other performers had outstanding performances, and they were all outstanding. On top of that, the music is really fantastic. It is impossible for me to adequately express why I feel the desire to have the music of this movie infused into my veins. The soundtrack was so powerful that it brought tears to my eyes even at the very beginning of the film, when there was nothing that was really occurring at that point!!!! In addition, I would like to draw attention to the outstanding costume design that was done for this film.

This movie brought us back into the realm of Panem, and it seemed as if we had never left! There were so many things and individuals that worked together to make this happen. The movie was really stunning, thanks to the stunning performances, locations, costumes, and music that Olivia Rodrigo contributed, among other things.

Since the first nostalgic film in the series, which was released in 2012 and starred Jennifer Lawrence as the legendary songbird mockingjay herself, Katniss Everdeen, this has quickly become my favorite installment in the series. All things considered, this is a smashing success for moviegoers and movie aficionados alike; you should not miss it when it is shown on the big screen.",2023-12-24T23:51:54.813Z,695721,4 stars,0.4716818630695343

r96sk,6.0,"I was thoroughly enjoying this... until it absolutely nosedives during the latter half.

<em>'The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes'</em> starts off so strongly, continuing at a pleasant pace as it encompasses the Hunger Games itself. However, from the end of the event it truly does drop off a cliff out of nowhere. The film gives you a major high of action with the games, then drops the tempo down to such a slow first act-esque pace that it feels extremely tacked on.

I did enjoy the cast throughout, mostly. Tom Blyth is excellent, first time I've seen him properly in a film and I was very impressed; though even his performance suffers with the aforementioned, which for him is from the point that he becomes The Real Slim Shady, seemingly (his originally look is so much better). Still, I'm eager to see that guy act further.

Rachel Zegler is largely good, though does chew the scenery quite a bit in parts; predominantly when singing. Viola Davis is great, while Peter Dinklage is underused but still a positive. Jason Schwartzman and Josh Andrés Rivera, meanwhile, are solid enough supports.

Just a shame about the final act. It's not necessarily that bad in itself, but to lower the pace that sharply after such prolonged thrill is a recipe for disaster.

It's an OK animation this, but the story is really quite thin with characters that don't much ignite the imagination - except, perhaps, the goat ""Valentino"" who has easily the best of what little comedy there is in the rather earnest script. The creatively entitled ""The Wish"" is the standard power ballad amongst the really quite unremarkable soundtrack that you just know is desperate to get to Leigh Harline's Disney theme tune ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" at the end. It's an amalgam of a few stories and will probably keep the youngsters entertained first time around. There's not a great deal for the grown ups, though, and I'm not sure it will be remembered for long into this animator's second century.",2023-11-29T08:04:59.406Z,1022796,3 stars,0.4325416088104248

""Wish is a magical journey about the vitality of personal wishes and the importance of pursuing those same dreams. Although the narrative follows a familiar structure and doesn't delve beyond the central theme, the nostalgia it evokes is certainly appreciated.

Ariana DeBose's powerful voice embodies the inspiring determination of the protagonist, leading a talented cast in a film marked by the beautiful blend of 2D and 3D animation, as well as original songs that, for the most part, win over the audience.

It's another charming chapter in Disney's vast library, offering a pleasant experience for fans of all ages.""

r96sk,7.0,"<em>'Wish'</em> lacks oomph with its story, but I found the soundtrack to be pleasing.

I think I literally liked every song, which is impressive. I wouldn't say any of them are pieces of music that I'd listen to on their own, at least not religiously or anything close, but connected with the movie onscreen the music is very fitting. ""This Wish"" and ""At All Costs"" are probably the standouts.

Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the plot. It's all suitably interesting and held my attention span from beginning to end, but there's just something missing - I can't quite put my finger on what - that stops this 2023 film from being anything above 'good' in my opinion.

The cast, like the music, are a positive. Chris Pine is very good, while Ariana DeBose leads more than competently; I've seen DeBose in a few flicks now and I do like her. Only post-watch am I learning that this was apparently billed as some sort of 100 year special for Disney as a company. How bizarre!",2024-07-30T23:43:53.309Z,1022796,3 stars,0.5374314188957214
Brent Marchant,6.0,"It’s frustrating to watch a much-anticipated movie that doesn’t quite live up to expectations. Such is the case with writer-director Cord Jefferson’s debut feature. The problem here is that the film tries to tell two stories in one picture, one that it does brilliantly and one that could use some serious trimming, because the inclusion of its segments interrupts the flow every time it comes up during the course of the narrative. This tale of a talented but commercially unsuccessful African-American author (Jeffrey Wright) laments the success of a younger peer (Issa Rae) who writes a best-selling “Black” book that he sees as little more than market-pandering rubbish. However, in response, when he does the same under a pseudonym as a means of protest, he becomes an overnight sensation for all of the artistic and readership considerations that he personally despises. He now has to ask himself how can live with that kind of success, especially when the title becomes a runaway juggernaut. As he struggles with this, he’s also faced with a family drama with the death of a relative, managing the future of care for his Alzheimer’s-afflicted mother (Leslie Uggams) and a ne’er-do-well, self-centered sibling who’s reluctant to help out (Sterling K. Brown). Unfortunately, the domestic story thread is overlong and tends to bog down the satirical social commentary/personal integrity aspects of the picture, which are really strong enough to stand on their own and should have been given wider play (fault the screenplay here). Despite its shortcomings, however, “American Fiction” definitely deserves kudos for the performances of its ensemble cast, especially Wright, who turns in his best work here and has garnered a number of awards season nominations already, with more undoubtedly to come. In all, though, this feels like an offering that’s half-baked for what it serves up, which is regrettable, given that, with some shoring up in the writing, this easily could have become a modern screen classic.",2023-12-25T00:08:11.695Z,1056360,3 stars,0.46413490176200867
CinemaSerf,7.0,"Jeffrey Wright is great in this satirical look at all things hypocritical and exploitative surrounding ""blackness"" in the USA. ""Monk"" is the short-tempered writer-cum-lecturer whose behaviour gets him put on indefinite leave by his university and sent to Boston! That's where his family live and where we get our first introduction to his sister ""Lisa"" (Tracee Ellis Ross). Now she's got the measure of her curmudgeonly brother and as they spar we start to see elements of his deeply-buried humanity emerge. Maybe he's not the man we first thought, and that depth of character becomes more evident as we meet his mother whose Alzheimers is causing confusion and distress. A tragedy strikes which forces ""Monk"" to re-address his own life choices, his relationship with his recently gay brother ""Cliff"" (Sterling K. Brown) and of his need to raise the almost $7,000 per month it will cost to ensure the best care for their ailing parent. His latest attempt at getting published failed. His agent ""Arthur"" (John Ortiz) telling him that his books just weren't black enough. He must be more like ""Sintara"" (Issa Rae) who writes books about 'real' African American people and their stereotypical ghetto language and experiences. He loathes the very essence of stuff like this, and so - in a fit of pique - cobbles together a novel called ""Pafology"" which he disdainfully sends off. To his bemused disgust, he is offered a lucrative seven figure sum - useful for the medical bills - and then, even more to his chagrin he meets film producer ""Wiley"" (Adam Brody) who wants to pay through the nose for the screen rights! Conflicted or what? He needs to look after his mother but his principles are abhorred by what he sees as a selling out. This scenario is only made the more ridiculous when he is asked to judge a prestigious literary award - and his now renamed best-seller is nominated! Cord Jefferson uses the brother's storyline as an engaging diversion - a broke plastic surgeon recently divorced and coming to his homosexuality late, but enthusiastically, in life. There's also his neighbour ""Coraline"" (Erika Alexander) to whom he takes a reciprocated shine - but can he make that work? It's genuinely laugh out loud at times as we see the frustrations of this man play out. It swipes at the superciliousness of an industry that is essentially not about culture or tradition: it's all about money and perception. The shallow things he despises. Will he come clean? Can he actually grow up a bit, too? Well that's skilfully dealt with in the gem of an ending! This is a cleverly conducted and innovative film that provokes thought and laughter in equal measure and showcases a talented ensemble effort well.",2024-02-08T11:07:49.239Z,1056360,4 stars,0.4694938361644745

r96sk,10.0,"Great movie!

This only solidifies my desire to view more, if not all, of Jeffrey Wright's filmography, such a fantastic actor to watch. In this he is no different, he is outstanding all the way through. Not that he is by any means the only strong performer, because Sterling K. Brown is also superb. Tracee Ellis Ross and Leslie Uggams impress, too.

There are a range of emotions to be felt throughout, the film entwines humour into events supremely well - it's much more amusing than I was expecting, especially given what happens early on. The latter is part of the sadness that constantly rears its head as well. No matter what, though, it is all seamlessly put together onscreen.

One scene in particular actually had me welling up, which is extremely rare for me; mentioned it before, unimportant long story short: I can't help but look at movies as fiction, so my brain just doesn't associate real physical emotions with films. Anyway, the scene is with Cliff (Brown) and Lorraine (Myra Lucretia Taylor). Proper touching!

Every now and then a film manages to break through! Probably a character flaw and all that but it is what it is. Fwiw, proof of the rarity is that the only other time I remember a film making me well up for real was, randomly, 2014's <em>'Two Days, One Night'</em> a few years back with an (relatively) equally non-major scene with Timur Magomedgadzhiev. 2022's <em>'The Whale'</em> did come very close, mind!

Back on track... I remember hearing positives about <em>'American Fiction'</em> when it came out and thankfully it delivered; 'twas unfortunate that it didn't line-up with me to watch it at the cinema on release, though. But hey, I belatedly have it logged. A quality picture!",2024-06-04T00:05:43.825Z,1056360,4 stars,0.6266224980354309
Brent Marchant,8.0,"Packing a lot of material and ideas into a single film can result in a muddled, confusing mess, no matter how well-meaning a filmmaker’s intentions might be. However, in his third feature outing, writer-director Kristoffer Borgli succeeds for the most part when it comes to tackling such an imposing task. This offbeat tale of tenured but underappreciated university professor (Nicolas Cage) takes viewers on a wild ride through the diverse realms of fame, metaphysics, cancel culture, unrelenting group think, and unexpressed, underpursued desire, and the downside consequences of each. All of this comes about when the middle-aged everyman protagonist inexplicably begins showing up in the dreams of countless people, many of whom he doesn’t even know. This curious oneiric anomaly – an inspired metaphor for one’s presence on social media and in the public eye – quickly transforms him into an overnight viral media sensation, one that starts off with a generous showering of attention and lustful admiration but that almost as quickly leads him to become a scorned put-upon pariah. He swiftly becomes more than just yesterday’s news; he turns into the object of a targeted campaign of cancel culture, hate speech and unapologetic ostracism. And, ironically, it all stems from something he never wanted nor asked for in the first place (at least in the form it ultimately took). From the foregoing description, it might sound like the filmmaker has tried to overstuff this vehicle with far too much material for viewers to process and comprehend, and there are points in the story (especially in the last half hour) where a good case could be made for that argument. However, in telling this allegorical fable, the director manages to keep the narrative’s ideas distinctly sorted and in context to drive home his message, a powerful cautionary tale about the point we’ve collectively reached as a society with respect to these powerful and potentially damaging matters and practices. These are notions that we all need to hear but seldom do because of all the noise surrounding us that prevents us from hearing the music because of all the notes. For all this seriousness, however, “Dream Scenario” is loaded with hilarious, laugh-out-loud humor and fine performances all around (especially Cage and Michael Cera as an empty-headed, self-absorbed brand management expert), complemented with skillful film editing and carefully selected incidental shots that effectively punctuate the mood of many scenes. The script is generally solid, too, though it begins to stray somewhat from the material that works best in the final act, and there are a few graphically violent sequences that sensitive viewers should be wary of. On balance, though, this is the kind of production that should be made in greater numbers in an age where so many of us have lost touch with reason, our existence and ourselves. Maybe watching an offering like this could help us all sit up, think and get back on track while we still can.",2023-11-19T16:10:21.191Z,823482,4 stars,0.3593956530094147
CinemaSerf,6.0,"When college professor ""Matthews"" (Nicolas Cage) starts appearing in the dreams of strangers (oh, and his wife!), his whole life is turned topsy-turvy. Initially it's all a rather benign phenomenon with his appearances fleeting, inconclusive and harmless. Until, that is, he meets one person who has been having a rather more intimate experience. Not only does this meeting not go very well (on various levels!) but it seems to change the very nature of the illusions for everyone, turning them more into nightmares... A predictable, occasionally violent, backlash ensues which makes the man's life - and that of his family - all but insufferable. What to do now his fame has come back to bite him? I quite enjoyed the first half hour of this quirky and entertainingly written drama. Cage is always rather good at taking the rise out of himself, and he seems to be enjoying the ride at the start. Once the story turns a bit darker, though, it runs out of steam. It's charm and uniqueness becomes rather subsumed in a rather unsubtle whack at the ""cancel culture"" that exists amongst those who live their lives via social media. It's not the first or the best to draw a parallel between what's real and what's fact - even when such distinctions are easily identifiable, and after a while I felt the film had no clear idea of how to conclude without actually proving it's own, rather depressing, point. The idea is interesting, the delivery is fine - but the end product is all a bit underwhelming.",2023-11-23T10:16:24.220Z,823482,3 stars,0.5444290637969971
BornKnight,7.0,"It must be not the most original movie but hey, it is something unexpected. Being from A24 I did what I do on almost all movies - didn't read anything about it beforehand. 

After watching the movie and taking my conclusion, I researched a bit about it: it is a black comedy movie from the norwegian (ok strange film spoiler) Kristoffer Borgli produced by Cage and Ari Aster. Ok, this also got my attention: the director has only 3 movies with this one, being the last one ""Sick of Myself"" (2022) literally the opposite of what this one talk about - a satyre of cancel culture in a mildly surrealistic way (maybe there also enters a pun later in the movie about France). 

He is a normal biology professor that starts popping into millions of people dreams and gains notoriety just to be the the fruit of nightmares and start to be cancelled by the society.

The base of the acting is the ""good actor version"" Nicolas Cage as Paul Matthews, a college professor and Julianne Nicholson as Janet Matthews, Paul's wife. Other recognized actors like Michael Cera in minor papers. 

The cinematography by Benjamin Loeb (""Mandy"", 2018, ""Pieces of a Woman"", 2020, ""After Yang"" 2020) is very effective especially in the use of angles. On the soundtrack, that is very adequate without any music other than OST the last music (credits one) City Of Dreams by 
Talking Heads is very nice.

But the real deal with the movie aside from the theme and story is Nicolas Cage in another good role, Thanks God for that.

Fortunately, it excels in its ensemble cast and their chemistry - Iman Vellani is the clear MVP - creative action set pieces, impressive visual effects, stunning costumes, and well-timed humor, which all together push the movie into safe harbor.

It appears that her new powers connect her to ""Danvers"" (Brie Larson) and her slightly estranged cohort ""Rambeau"" (Teyonah Parris). When they use their powers they find themselves transported into each other's shoes - causing mayhem all over the place, especially at the family home of the rookie superhero who is as yet unaware of just quite how powerful her shiny amulet is. ""Dar-Benn"" is out for revenge. After ""Danvers"" destroyed the AI that controlled their planet, it has gone into terminal decay and so she decides to reinstate her world by stealing the atmosphere from one world, then the water from another - where they only speak in song, so perhaps no great loss - before deciding to borrow the sun from Earth to reinvigorate their own failing star. With a little help from ""Nick Fury"" (Samuel L. Jackson) the three have to galvanise their powers and focus on thwarting this dastardly design before it's too late. Now there is nothing even remotely original in this. It's all join the dots Marvel adventure with the usual pyrotechnics, spectacular visual effects and thinnest of stories. The denouement is never in doubt and actually feels rather rushed after a first half hour of repetitive combat scenes that don't draw breath but don't really entertain either. Larson is a natural actor (she reminds me a lot of Grace Kelly) but nobody here really has much by way of dialogue to work with as we see this film manoeuvred into the path of another franchise that it would appear destined to join with next time. Barbra Streisand makes a surprise (vocal) appearance during quite an innovative scene herding cats and simultaneously saving people, but I found the rest of this to be same old, same old and though shorter than we are used to, it's still all a bit old hat.

Brent Marchant,5.0,"When I first heard the title of this movie, I thought it was about a 1960s girls’ singing group. And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta’s third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn’t have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren’t adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren’t explained at all, leaving viewers who aren’t comic book laureates wondering what’s going on (particularly at film’s end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn’t particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture’s pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that’s growing tiresome in the studio’s releases, a development akin to the “Paul is dead” legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there’s the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they’ve been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, “The Marvels” is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that’s troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren’t to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they’re cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like “Wakanda Forever” (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work – and it’s time to show viewers that.",2023-11-11T23:49:36.686Z,609681,2 stars,0.5498775839805603

It <em>is</em> interesting seeing the film portray a different type of version of Elvis Presley, one that is uncomfortable to watch unfold but one that ought to be told. That's where anything noteworthy I have to say about this release ends, though. As a movie, it's rather boring. I'm not convinced there's enough to be told across a full blown picture, at least not one around 1hr 45mins in length. I will say that Cailee Spaeny puts in a solid display as the titular character, in fairness.

Jacob Elordi as Elvis, in my opinion, isn't a positive to be honest. If I didn't know he was playing Elvis I genuinely wouldn't have guessed he was playing the singer, aside from a few outfits and the twisty bit of hair in his fringe. Accent particularly seemed off to me too, Elordi amusingly (given the director's connection) sounds more like Nicolas Cage (c. 1997, <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/con-air/"" rel=""nofollow"">Con Air</a>'</em>, Cameron Poe) on phone call scenes.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Having recently watched Bradley Cooper's ""Maestro"" (2023) and ""Tchaikovsky's Wife"" (2022) I was wondering if Sofia Coppola was about to bowl us a bit of a googly about Elvis here after half an hour! The young Priscilla (a competent Cailee Spaeny) is invited to meet him (Jacob Elordi) in Germany where both he and her father are serving in the US military. Not yet 16, she is chaperoned to his home where it's quite clear they take a shine to each other. He returns home and after a while sends for her to come visit Graceland. She's totally besotted by this stage and what follows tells us the story of their burgeoning relationship. It's got to be said, that's not always plain sailing - he is hugely charismatic, but has a temper, is controlling, and is very career-minded. He's also not that interested in consummating their relationship, either! History tells us the rest and with the lady herself executive producing we're not going to stray very far from the facts - as she saw them - that gripped the tabloids and the world. It's curious that her parents would have allowed their pubescent daughter to go live with a millionaire rock star half a world away, and of course once she's there she is soon taking his uppers and downers like a trooper to stay the pace. At times, it's quite a potent look at just what both wanted from the relationship, and at how it becomes clear that it is impossible for both to reconcile their aspirations with their desired obligations to/of each other. It also shows us the increasing lack of a sense of self-worth or fulfilling continuity to her increasingly lonely existence. That's a well-made point in illustrating just how shell-like her day to day life was as she had access to unlimited funds but not to any palpable feelings of being needed or loved. Talking of pace, though, that's one of the things that I found really let this down. He is home, then he goes away, makes a film, has ""alleged"" affairs, comes home then does it all over again. Also, there is a real lack of his music here. Not that it's supposed to be about him, but it was an integral part of his allure and his personality - not to reflect that rendered his character rather charm-free and the rather bland Elordi hasn't really the skills to imbue his character with much, well, character on his own. I am afraid that I found this all just a bit shallow and though beautifully set, just too sterile a look at the turbulent life of those two people. It just lacks passion, power and substance.",2024-01-10T07:01:59.394Z,1020006,3 stars,0.40913787484169006
Brent Marchant,6.0,"When a film seeks to depict the life story of a beloved public figure, it generally works best when it paints a comprehensive portrait of said individual. However, in this biography of the wife of rock ʼn roll icon Elvis Presley, viewers get a picture that seemingly tells only half of the story. Writer-director Sofia Coppola’s latest focuses on the years Priscilla Presley (Cailee Spaeny) spent with Elvis (Jacob Elordi). They embark on a sincerely loving relationship that, sadly, falls prey to problems with drugs, firearms, infidelity, prolonged separations and control freak tendencies, conditions – largely initiated by Elvis – that eventually lead to their separation (and at times cause the film to be more about him than her). Regrettably, the choice of this narrative leaves out the many significant personal and professional accomplishments of Priscilla’s life on her own, an inspiring story that’s completely (and perplexingly) overlooked. As a consequence, viewers are primarily shown a profile of a predominantly subservient character who rarely rebels until she finally somehow musters up the courage to leave (where did that trait come from?), with nothing about the successes that followed. In addition, there are many story threads that feel unresolved or underdeveloped, leaving audiences hanging about what comes from them. To its credit, “Priscilla” is, in several respects, some of the best (though surprisingly most conventional) work that Coppola has produced as a filmmaker, as evidenced in the cinematography and editing and in Elordi’s balanced portrayal of Elvis. But, like other of Coppola’s efforts, this offering could still use some tidying up in the writing, character development and overall story structure. The wife of a King truly warrants better treatment.",2024-02-26T11:11:20.074Z,1020006,2 stars,0.4262906610965729

""The Holdovers left me in complete disbelief at how complete, thought-provoking, hilarious, and emotionally powerful it becomes with each extraordinarily captivating minute that passes by.

A shockingly faultless screenplay from David Hemingson exponentially attacks the viewers' hearts through a truly profound yet bittersweet study of the vital need for human connection. Protagonists are brilliantly written as real people, and superbly portrayed by an award-worthy cast.

Add an immaculate tonal balance and outstanding execution by Alexander Payne, and a new Christmas classic is born.""

Brent Marchant,6.0,"Heartwarming films for the holidays are something we’re all supposed to love, right? Well, if you’re talking about the works of directors like Frank Capra, George Seaton, Michael Curtiz and Chris Columbus, you’d be correct. But, since it’s been so long since we’ve had releases of that quality, in recent years, viewers hungry for such movies have been glomming on to anything that even remotely approaches such titles, whether or not the accolades are deserved. And that, in my view, sums up my feelings on the much-celebrated new feature from director Alexander Payne. This tale of a curmudgeonly, condescending, middle-aged, fuss-budget prep school teacher (Paul Giamatti) assigned to babysit a group of rambunctious students who are unable to be with their families for the year-end holidays has a premise with considerable potential that, unfortunately, is squandered by a narrative that feels loosely stitched together and ultimately comes across as patently undercooked. Indeed, what could have been a fun-filled romp a la a Christmastime take on movies like “Dead Poets Society” (1989), regrettably, comes up decidedly short. Admittedly, the film has its share of modestly funny and warm, fuzzy moments, but many of the scenes don’t flow smoothly from one to the next, creating a storyline that feels forced without delivering the goods to make a release like this work. While it’s true that the film succeeds (surprisingly) at depicting the mostly one-dimensional characters’ requisite personal evolution over the course of the picture, that almost-accidental accomplishment is seriously overshadowed by a series of plot elements that largely feel thrown together, incorporated without a terribly great amount of thought and an undeniable lack of cohesiveness. And, to be honest, the picture’s most interesting character is the academy’s chief cook (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), whose richly layered persona (and deftly nuanced performance) runs circles around those of its other two principals (Giamatti and Dominic Sessa as one of the stranded students). It’s disappointing that a director as talented as Alexander Payne has churned out a project as half-baked as this one is (particularly one that comes across as self-satisfied with itself as this offering often does) when compared to previous titles like “Nebraska” (2013) and “The Descendants” (2011). And would-be viewers should be wary of many of the inflated claims and awards season buzz being showered on this offering. But, in an age in which moviegoers are looking for pictures that provide the kind of holiday cinema comfort they so desperately crave, it’s understandable that such viewers might be drawn to a film like this.

Ritesh Mohapatra,-1.0,"The Holdovers is a thoughtful, sweet and pleasantly heartwarming film which feels like an old warm hug

My Score : 92/100

""The Holdovers"" is heartwarming tale of unlikely friendships. It's the kind of movie that lingers with you, gently nudging your conscience and leaving your heart a little fuller than before. The storyline is relatively straightforward, yet it's beautifully executed in a way that breathes a palpable life into each character and every scene.The film's setting, the 1970s, is captured with a sense of brilliance and authenticity that transport you back in time. The arcs of sensibility and chemistry between the characters grow on you as you watch their journey unfold. The film's runtime of 133 minutes feels like a swift, captivating journey rather than a drawn-out narrative. The powerful performances by the central leads, storytelling that feels personal, and the charming chemistry between the characters make this a wonderful Christmas film.


1. Heartwarming 1970s film: The film's setting, the 1970s, is captured with a sense of brilliance , subtlety and authenticity that transport you back in time. The film doesn't claim to be a comedy, but the subtle humour injected into the narrative adds a layer of charm and depth.

2. Compelling characters: The plot revolves around a cranky history teacher (Paul Giamatti), a troubled student, and a grieving cook. What starts as a friction-filled teacher-student relationship gradually evolves into an endearing friendship. The arcs of sensibility and chemistry between the characters grow on you as you watch their journey unfold. 

3. Thoughtful Narrative : Holdovers is an heartwarming tale of unlikely friendship which carefully takes its characters and give them their own arcs. Its so sensible yet cheerful that you fall for the characters instantly as you spend some time with them.

4. Swift and engaging:  The film's runtime of 133 minutes feels like a swift, captivating journey rather than a drawn-out narrative. Feels like a smooth buttery screenplay transporting you in the 1970s and you dont need to exercise your brains and enjoy a film.

5. Oscar-worthy performances: Paul Giamatti, in his portrayal of Paul Hunham, delivers a performance that is nothing short of magnetic. His brilliant acting justifies why he is often termed ingenious. He brings a depth to his character that feels authentic and relatable, making it easy for the audience to root for him. Dominic Tessa, as Angus Tully, encapsulates his character's loneliness, frustration, and excitement with a performance that is exceptional. He is a bright star in the making.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Anyone remember John Houseman's professor ""Kingsfield"" in ""The Paper Chase"" (1973)? Well, that's who Paul Giamatti reminded me of here with his portrayal of the acerbic, no-nonsense, ancient civilisations lecturer ""Hunham"". It's the last day of term and he hands out examination results that persist at the lower end of the A-F scale! This causes quite a bit of consternation amongst the silver-spooned students who fear their wealthy parents more than him. He agrees to try and mitigate these impending disasters by giving them extra work but that just irritates the B+ student ""Tully"" (Dominic Sessa) whose intervention doesn't exactly make him any friends! Anyway, serendipity takes her revenge now and this lad's planned Christmas in St. Kitts is kiboshed and he finds himself stuck at school over the holidays with his least favourite school colleague ""Kountze"" (Brady Hepner) and his teaching nemesis all sleeping in the infirmary! Drawbridges are up and battle lines drawn right from the outset, and are only exacerbated when the other kids are whisked off skiing leaving just the two and their long-suffering cook ""Mary"" (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) - a lady who also happens to be grieving for her son who has been killed in action before his twentieth birthday. Not the makings for much festivities, but gradually the three begin to bond a little, the ice begins to thaw and - well I suppose the rest isn't really too hard to guess. It's not really the story that makes this work - that's not especially unique. It's the three characterful performances - especially from the young Sessa - peppered with a wonderful selection of perfectly delivered sarcastic humour, temper tantrums, a little slapstick and an increasingly engaging rapport between the two men who must learn to overcome their differences - some serious, some trivial, some completely non-existent - so that maybe, just maybe, they will be able to resume after the New Year on less openly hostile terms. To that end, our trio take a trip to Boston - but will that help? It does rather run out of steam towards the predicable ending but the first forty minutes are genuinely laugh out loud at times. Giamatti and Randolph are naturals with Sessa looking like a man we will see again. Good fun with messages of humanity and reconciliation that are delivered using comedy rather than too much sentiment.",2024-01-28T14:08:02.962Z,840430,3 stars,0.5464361310005188

Manuel São Bento,6.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/the-killer-venice-film-festival-review-a-tense-yet-superficial-experience/

""The Killer is unquestionably the simplest, most straightforward movie of David Fincher's career, for better and for worse. On one hand, Michael Fassbender's melancholy narration and magnetic performance, as well as the moody cinematography and throbbing score, contribute to the immersive, tension-driven experience remarkably idealized and executed by the filmmaker.

On the other hand, the lack of any emotional layer related to the superficial story and nameless characters, along with a repetitive structure devoid of secondary arcs, gradually alienates viewers from the equally underdeveloped fictional world.

A case of admiration more than enjoyment.""

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Does anyone remember Baz Luhrmann's song ""Sunscreen""? Well the narrative mantra provided here by assassin Michael Fassbender reminded me of some of the profundities of that lyric - though not as wittily. The remainder of this film, however, is unlikely to be conjuring up memories anytime soon. His meticulously planned kill takes out a poor, leather-clad, school mistress instead of the intended target and so he has to flee. Now one might assume that such a character would be un-spookable. Well, nope - not this one. He is actually a bit nervous as he takes the long route home to safety in the Dominican Republic. When he gets there, he discovers that it wouldn't have been that safe there either as his pal ""Magdala"" (Sophie Charlotte) has been seriously wounded in an assault on his remote home. Bent on revenge, he sets out to track down the offenders and ultimately determines to come face to face with the millionaire client. Now he hasn't quite got a Yellow Pages, but his detective work is carried out with rather brutal ease. We have the odd combat scene, a dog gets pretty zoned out with painkillers and the denouement - featuring a sparing contribution from Tilda Swinton - has precisely zero menace or sophistication to it. Fassbender is very easy on the eye, but the rest of this is about as derivative as it gets - a sort of distant cousin of ""The Mechanic"" (2011) and it's not really very good.",2023-11-01T13:28:20.797Z,800158,2 stars,0.4752332270145416

That said, when you take a step back, its still ""just another"" hit man flick, leaving far shallower footsteps, than say, Leon: The Professional.

Its essentially driven by a very basic story, that's too truncated to add up to anything  meaningful, partially compensated for by lashings of action packed, exposition and a degree of quality narrative.

In and of itself, its marginally better than many other knock off's but not by as much, as it might think.

BornKnight,8.0,"Raw and ruthless - The Killer by David Fincher is basically a 75% thriller 25% action movie that tells about the daily life of a hired hitman - that makes a mistake on job (this is shown in the first 30 min). Then he and who he cares (a girlfriend in Dominican Republic) will pay the price - but things aren't so easy. It reminded me very much the ecstasy of seeing the fist movie incarnation of 007 by Daniel Craig raw violence and not a snobby agent on a suit. 

He won't let those whom did he things go impune, so what to do do? Chase one by one, hitman style, silent, evasive, focalized - the prototype of a Sigma male (like others characters aka John Wick, James Bond, etc.).

David Fincher is already know by a huge list of excellent movies including The SOcial Network, Se7ven, Gone Girl, Fight Club, The Zodiac, Mindhunter and the list go on. He already have his established style, violent and gritty and The Killer doesn't go far from it. 

Don't get me wrong - this isn't from the ""another movie"" perspective, by another good movie perspective. Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en, 8mm) wrote the script based on the french comic book 'Le Tueurby"" by the writer Matz and artist Luc Jacamon (2000).

Action wise, the movie have more scenes of the standard procedures of the ""profession"" that raw action, aside from one chapter, where there is a brutal fight (the movie is divided in chapters btw). Michael Fassbender and the others (I am truly a fan of any movie that Tilda Swinton stars) - are the pieces that make the movie especially the first one, raw, obstinate and methodic while always listening to ""The Smiths"" to keep his mind clean and focus on what to do, to not deviate from the plan. 

Although there are few lines of dialog between characters, 90% os the dialog is from Fassbender in first person, on the thoughts in his mind. 

Aside from the strange fitting of Morrissey in the music track, we have a minimalistic but sober OST made impeccability by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. This movie is a must watch to anyone that enjoy hitman's movies - I gave it a 8,0 out of 10,0 score / A-.

MustachedMovieMan,7.0,"I don't really get what all the negative reviews are about.
It's not the best movie ever or that I've seen this year, but I still had a good time watching it. The story was interesting, it had some scary parts, some humorous parts, lots of tension, was well-acted, well-shot, and the effects (both practical and CGI) were well-done. Also, the production design and creature design was great.

A movie doesn't have to be restricted to either being ""the best"" or ""horrible."" The theater I saw it in was packed, the audience was responsive and seemed to be loving it, and I myself enjoyed it.

I didn't really play the games, but I was definitely engaged in the lore of some of the MatPat Game Theory videos I saw. And I could tell from audience reactions that there were some cool things in the movie if you knew the games. That's not a negative, to be clear. It's always really cool when filmmakers put things in movies that true fans would catch and geek-out about.

As far as being a viewer who didn't really play the games, I enjoyed the movie. And while I think knowing the games/lore would have definitely enhanced my enjoyment and enthusiasm, I wouldn't say it lacks as a movie or that the games are ""required viewing"" for those who haven't played them. Everything's explained pretty well.

As far as the horror aspect goes, it is PG-13; I saw some reviews complaining about the lack of gore... It's PG-13. C'mon guys.
But, that being said, I thought they still did a good job with the horror elements that were present.

Well a meeting with the enigmatic police officer ""Vanessa"" (Elizabeth Lail) should have rung alarm bells, and when he has to take ""Abby"" there for one overnight shift - well it's soon clear that this place has secrets to keep and that it knows how to manipulate the hopes and fears of ""Mike"" and his sister. Can they stay sane and focussed long enough to survive this maze of malevolent mechanical bunnies? I'm afraid the presence of Matthew Lillard never helps a film, and here is no different - this is just a rather nonsensical attempt at a spooky mystery that certainly has nothing to make you jump. Rubio is actually quite decent, but there's isn't enough else happening to compensate for the very slow build up, surfeit of dialogue and frankly rather silly underlying premiss. I suppose as Halloween gets bigger and bigger, we are going to get more and more of these mediocre offerings - but despite it's more prominent cast, this just belongs on the Horror channel at 2am.",2023-11-02T09:34:31.341Z,507089,3 stars,0.5543088316917419

Those interviews and BTS videos really helped me understand the love and care Blumhouse, Scott Cawthon Productions, and Jim Henson's put into the world that they all knew so many loved. But I wouldn't go any higher than 3.5 or 7/10 because there were not that many jump scares or good scares. It got me a few times, but not as many as I wished for. and they didn't show much of William or the Spring Bonnie suit. William Afton is the villain of this franchise. In every universe FNaF has, there is a William, and he kills, and I feel like they swung and missed the ball with William a little.

To get this out of the way, Jim Henson's company did a fantastic job bringing the animatronic horrors to life. All the animatronic suits look phenomenal; it looks like they ripped them straight from the game. The Easter egg characters also looked really good. Jim Henson's done an awesome job! The actors for the film were great as well: Josh Hutcherson, Elizabeth Lail, and Matthew Lillard. All great actors that fit their roles perfectly. I am a little sad that Matthew Lillard's role, William Afton, didn't have that much screen time. For being the main villain of the whole film, he only had a big twist at the end. Speaking of the big twist, Matthew Lillard played William Afton perfectly; I can't imagine someone else playing the role. He tuned into who William Afton was so well. The line ""I always come back"" didn't really fit; at that moment, how does he know he will come back? The lack of scares in the film and the fact that Mr. Cupcake gets the most kills in the whole film are insane to me. FNaF is a jumpscare game, and this film focused more on the human story, which is fine; I would've liked more than a few jumpscares. I also don't care for the animatronics being all friendly; their kids are trapped in robots. Unless those kids were born killing, I can't see how people can be mad at the animatronics for being friendly.",2024-02-13T01:40:37.777Z,507089,3 stars,0.41556692123413086

I feel like more could've been done with the mascots via the animatronics as well as giving them each some sorta creepy voice, though this is of course based on a video game so if that's how they are in the game (which I've never played nor heard of) then I guess this is not a valid 'criticism'. Just as a film, I think that would've made it more lively.

<em>'Five Nights at Freddy’s'</em>, as it is, is a passable supernatural horror. Josh Hutcherson does an acceptable job as lead, as Elizabeth Lail and youngster Piper Rubio do well too. More could've perhaps been done with Matthew Lillard's character, though Lillard is himself is alright.

tmdb98094809,6.0,"Alright, so I just saw ""Five Nights at Freddy's,"" and I gotta say, it was... interesting! If you're a fan of the video games, you'll definitely find some familiar faces and creepy vibes, but even if you've never played, there's still a decent horror story to be enjoyed.

Let's start with the atmosphere. They really nailed that unsettling feeling you get from the games. The abandoned Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria is super creepy, with its dim lighting, dusty arcade games, and those... animatronics. Seriously, those things are unsettling! The movie does a good job of building tension, especially when you're waiting for something to jump out at you. There are a few moments where I definitely jumped in my seat!

The story follows a new security guard, Mike, who takes a job at the closed-down pizzeria. He's got some personal stuff going on, which adds a bit of emotional depth to the story. It's not just about jump scares; there's a real human element to it, which I appreciated. Some of the characters were pretty cool, and I enjoyed watching their interactions.

Now, where things get a bit... mixed. The plot can be a little slow at times. There are moments where it feels like it's taking its time to get to the scary parts, and some of the dialogue felt a little clunky. Also, if you were expecting non-stop, intense horror, you might be a little disappointed. There are definitely creepy moments, but it's not a super gory or overly scary movie. It's more of a suspenseful thriller with some horror elements.

The special effects were pretty good, especially the animatronics. They looked really realistic and moved in a way that was both cool and unsettling. The visuals definitely added to the overall creepy vibe of the movie.

Overall, I'd give ""Five Nights at Freddy's"" a solid 6/10. It's a decent horror film with a cool atmosphere, some good jump scares, and a story that keeps you somewhat engaged. If you're a fan of the games, you'll probably enjoy it more, but even if you're not, it's still a fun, spooky watch. Just don't go in expecting the scariest movie ever made, and you'll have a good time! It’s a fun spooky movie to watch with friends.",2025-04-07T05:10:18.797Z,507089,3 stars,0.5352652072906494

""Pain Hustlers fulfills the basic requirement of explaining the harrowing true story effectively, but given its star leads and skillful director at the helm, it could have and probably should have been much better.

While Emily Blunt and Chris Evans deliver strong performances, director David Yates falters in his tonal balance, treating the deaths of many innocent victims with an uncomfortable lightness that may leave viewers, especially American's familiar with this story, feeling it's insensitive or irresponsible.

Thematically, the tragic consequences of obsessing over wealth leading to the detriment of other's lives are well-depicted, but the overall lack of originality and extended runtime make the whole thing a mixed experience.""

Brent Marchant,8.0,"It’s been said that it’s never too late to pursue one’s dream. But how many of us who are getting on in years actually make the effort to accomplish that? As time passes by, we may begin to feel like life is passing us by, too, sweeping away the opportunities to fulfill those aspirations and leading to relentless disappointment, frustration and depression. So it was for famed marathon swimmer Diana Nyad (Annette Bening) as she entered her senior years. Having accomplished much as a long-distance open water swimmer as a young adult, she subsequently became a broadcaster for ABC Sports, serving as an expert on the subject. But that work didn’t provide the same satisfaction as what she was born to do, an undertaking that made her feel like she had taken a 30-year detour in her destiny. That changed, however, when she decided to get back in the water and attempt to make the 103-mile swim from Havana, Cuba to Key West, FL, a long-cherished dream she tried but failed at when she was 28. At 60, however, she believed she could still do it, and so she set off on a quest to complete it, a pursuit that everyone said was unrealistic and impossible at her age. As a headstrong, never-say-die force to reckon with, though, Nyad forged ahead with her best friend, Bonnie (Jodie Foster), serving as her often-beleaguered coach. Directors Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi bring this fact-based story to life in this engaging biopic, chronicling Nyad’s odyssey and, in the process, never shying away from portraying the fabled swimmer from all angles, both as a heroic, determined role model and as an off-putting, obstinate pain in the butt. The storytelling approach is admittedly somewhat formulaic and a tad overlong, but the picture’s overall execution provides an authentic depiction of the grueling ordeal Nyad and her crew underwent, all effectively brought to life by the star power of Bening and Foster in their respective roles. The film also provides Nyad’s childhood back story, illustrating how she steeled her lifelong resolve for success and refused to play the part of a victim when the going got tough. It’s also refreshing to see a release that’s not afraid to showcase the story of an older woman, an often-overlooked demographic in contemporary cinema about a character who just might have something worth saying. “Nyad” probably doesn’t qualify as epic filmmaking, but it certainly makes the most of everything it has to work with, presenting viewers with an entertaining and inspiring watch, especially for those who feel cast aside and reconciled to their circumstances but who still have a burning desire for excellence aflame within them.",2023-11-09T13:31:44.284Z,895549,3 stars,0.41662684082984924
Manuel São Bento,6.0,"MORE SPOILER-FREE MINI-REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/mini-reviews-2023-edition

""NYAD is anchored by powerhouse performances, with Annette Bening and Jodie Foster delivering award-worthy portrayals in a film that draws inspiration from Diana Nyad's 53-hour open-water swim at the age of 64. Based on Nyad's book, this adaptation unfolds with heartfelt, authentic dialogue that enthralls the audience in the emotional journey of the protagonist's remarkable achievement. However, the movie falls into the typical pitfalls of biopics, sidestepping real-life controversies, such as the uncertified nature of the swim - a notable omission that doesn't help the credibility of the extraordinary feat. In addition to this, the film also succumbs to the formulaic constraints of Oscar-bait flicks, lacking creativity, and eventually becoming repetitive. Despite its shortcomings, it remains a compelling watch, driven by outstanding displays and an inspiring story at its core.""

The storyline revolves around an elderly individual striving to achieve their dream of becoming a swimmer, a significant personal accomplishment given the challenges they face in the vast ocean.

While the concept of an elderly swimmer overcoming obstacles is commendable, I found the lack of dramatic events somewhat puzzling. The movie seemed to be missing those intense, gripping moments that typically drive a narrative forward. Although the characters addressed some questions along the way, the overall pacing made the film feel somewhat lackluster and monotonous.

Nevertheless, the desire to see if the protagonist reaches their goal kept me engaged until the end. While I did watch it through once, I don't see myself revisiting this film anytime soon as it didn't leave a lasting impact on me.",2024-09-02T19:02:38.699Z,895549,3 stars,0.7878667712211609
Lachlan Thiele,8.0,"<b>INT. GANGSTERS IN OKLAHOMA - DAY</b>


Film students, film lovers, cinema-goers, and reviewers rejoice! <i>Martin Scorsese's</i> latest film is excellent! <i>The Irishman</i> might have been his last 'gangster' film. Still, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> might not be a gangster film, but there are many 'mob' elements within it.

The biggest fear people had going into this film was the runtime. Weeks before the release, speculations came out about the length of this film. I saw an article stating it would be 4 hours long! Alas, it's only 206 minutes long, not even coming close to the longest film here at Cannes. I can confirm that the film never drags its feet for too long; there are times when it slows down, but this is only during the film's opening hour. Thankfully it quickly picks up the pace and goes by fast once the whole ensemble is introduced. <i>Jesse Plemons</i> is a late bloomer in the film, only being introduced 2 hours in; as I said, this is where the film starts moving.

The story is simple: During the 1920s, oil was discovered on Osage Nation Land. Turning them into the richest people per capita in the world! <b>Ernest Burkhart</b> (<i>Leonardo DiCaprio</i>) returns to work for his uncle, <b>William Hale</b> (<i>Robert De Niro</i>). Ernest meets <b>Mollie</b> (<i>Lily Gladstone</i>), and they marry. However, slowly many of Mollie's friends and family are murdered, with those who married into the family taking ownership of the land—eventually, the FBI steps in to investigate.

Lily and Leo have excellent on-screen chemistry, with Lily performing phenomenally. I hear talks about the Oscars for her, which is entirely valid. De Niro steals many of the scenes he's in, often providing the most laughs. He is ultimately the most 'mob-like character within the film, never pulling the trigger but commanding the troops. Jesse Plemons is the final major character within the story as <b>Tom White</b>. Unfortunately, Plemon's isn't that interesting; I wonder if Plemons wasn't given much direction or if he decided to make the character this way. Still, White moves from scene to scene without much interest. He's just there, leading the FBI but never being an individual; I didn't remember his name after the film; I just referred to him as 'FBI guy.'

Technically, <i>Killers of the Flower Moon</i> is a marvel (Not that Scorsese would like me saying the word 'Marvel'), but just like all of his films, everything is great. Nothing stands out as 'excellent'; the score, editing and cinematography are at the level you'd expect from the mind of Scorsese.

This leads me to my final thoughts on the film; recently, Martin has been talking about his age and his ability to make films like he used to. Scorsese is 80 years old and doesn't believe he has the same drive as <i>Ridley Scott</i>. Suppose this is to be his final film. In that case, I'd be happy knowing it's not a significant departure from what made him the famed director but a story worth telling from a creator who will continue to be studied and praised for the next many decades.

""Killers of the Flower Moon is a remarkable cinematic feat by the master Martin Scorsese, with exceptional contributions from Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, as well as a striking, breakthrough performance by Lily Gladstone.

It unveils a harrowing narrative that prompts deep, poignant reflection on the past and present. Technically, all departments shine, but Thelma Schoonmaker’s editing is simply flawless. The commitment to authenticity and the use of the Osage language are commendable additional traits.

The final sequence is one of the most powerful conclusions in recent years, a memorable, thought-provoking commentary on the desensitization of modern entertainment. A must-watch!""

CinemaSerf,7.0,"First things first. There is absolutely no need for this to be 3½ hours long. It follows the story of the ambitious ""Ernest"" (Leonardo DiCaprio) who arrives at the Osage home of his venal uncle ""King"" (Robert De Niro) who encourages him to ingratiate himself with the wealthy, indigenous, population. He ends up meeting and driving the independent, no-nonsense, ""Mollie"" (Lily Gladstone) and after a while she starts to fall for his charismatic charms, they fall in love and marry. Though he does love his wife, ""Ernest"" proves to be a rather fickle and violent man who loves money more - and at the behest of his outwardly benign relative starts to implement schemes that will ensure the rights to the oil well heads move swiftly - and frequently brutally - to more ""suitable"" owners. This sudden spate of ""accidents"" and killings and the prudent action of the fearful local council alert the authorities in Washington who despatch a team of FBI agents led by the tenacious ""White"" (Jesse Plemons) to get to the bottom of things. Perhaps the ""King"" house of cards might now be becoming just a but precarious? DiCaprio is very effective here. He plays well a man who juggles internal demons and conflicts as he is cleverly manipulated by an on-form, slightly menacing, De Niro. It's Gladstone who steals the show for me, though. She plays the role of the decent and loving - but shrewd and savvy - ""Mollie"" strongly. As she starts to become a victim of her husband's avarice she exudes a sense of desperation that is both pleading and dignified and her struggle is potently illustrative of just how far the ""white"" man was prepared to go to get to - and keep - the money. The film is beautifully shot with a plausible look that helps generate for the audience a true sense of just how this outwardly genteel and civilised society was really anything but and the writing clearly interweaves the clandestine aspects of the the plot with the more noble ones. Perhaps sacrilegious to say, though, but at times it does really drag. I felt it could easily have lost an hour, condensed the story and immersed us more quickly in the characterisations and not really suffered. It's a good film, but it's not a great film and unlike Scorsese's far better ""Irishman"" (2019), I'm not at all sure I will rush to watch it again.",2023-10-19T10:13:23.967Z,466420,4 stars,0.4140244722366333

Brent Marchant,8.0,"The importance of addressing (and attempting to correct) gross injustices can’t be overemphasized, and that’s the key objective behind writer-director Martin Scorsese’s latest release. This fact-based saga chronicles attempts by unscrupulous, two-faced White swindlers clandestinely (and sometimes quite brazenly) seeking to steal the considerable assets of wealthy Osage Indians in Oklahoma in the 1920s after oil is discovered on their land. This tragic tale explores the depths that these immoral criminals would go to (including murder) in the name of unabashed greed, efforts ironically spearheaded by the local, smiling, allegedly well-meaning sheriff (Robert DeNiro) with the help of his dimwitted nephew (Leonardo DiCaprio), especially in their scheme to shamelessly pilfer the wealth of the accomplice’s own wife (Lily Gladstone). The sweeping scope of this offering is indeed impressive, effectively brought to life by the fine performances of the three principals and an excellent ensemble of supporting players. And the stellar cast is backed by proficiently executed work in an array of technical areas, including production design, writing, cinematography and the original background score, making for a gorgeous picture to look at, all of which have earned “Flower Moon” a boatload of awards season nominations, with more undoubtedly to follow. However, the runtime of 3:26:00 – with no intermission – is a challenge to manage, even for the most patient and tolerant moviegoer. I streamed it, watching it in two parts, almost as if it were more of a TV miniseries than a standalone film, the only way I could effectively see myself getting through it. This handling of the story, in my opinion, represents something of a significant miscalculation by the filmmaker and the film editing staff – either cut the picture (which could have been done without losing much) or add a much-needed break partway through (which could have been accomplished without inhibiting the story’s continuity). In my view, I believe that the second half was far better and more compelling than the first and that some of the narrative’s more incidental detail could have easily been dispensed with without affecting the overall quality of the release. Still, that aside, it’s obvious that this project was a labor of love for the director, one with a clear vision of what it wanted to say in relating an important and little-known story of injustice in a nation that professes to be a staunch champion of truth and virtue, and, for that, we should be thankful for the enlightenment provided here. This unconventional take on the Western may not feature the traditional cinematic interpretation of cowboys and Indians, but it nevertheless sets the record straight about who the real villains are, at least in this story, a lesson from which we can all learn.",2023-12-31T17:15:26.067Z,466420,3 stars,0.41884225606918335

Peter McGinn,7.0,"This movie was well-made, though its structure seemed familiar. It is a Scorsese film so perhaps it was the mob-like plot: a wealthy big shot tries to appear as a benign community leader, while he buys local political and law enforcement protection, has others do the dirty work, and throws any of them under the bus if the corruption is exposed. Just substitute the native Osage lands for the inner city neighborhood. In this case, rather than bootlegging, gambling or prostitution, the bad guy (William Hale) traffics mainly in murder. The goal is to have the sale rights of the Osage people’s oil land transferred from the murder victims to a white spouse in bad guy Bill Hale’s pocket, or through other machinations, to him directly.

The screen time is mostly taken up by Hale, his nephew Ernest Burkhart and Burkhart’s Osage wife Mollie. Ernest loves her but he is weak and kowtows to Hale’s wishes, even to the point of endangering his wife. Finally he — but I won’t give anything further away in the plot.

The only criticism I will make is that a lot of people are murdered in this story, especially from Mollie’s own family, and we see very little about the other victims except for a little insight into Mollie’s wild sister Annie. If you are going to use 3 1/2 hours to tell a story, I think a tad more character development on some of the victims would not go amiss.
However, the movie is well-made, as I said earlier, but I don’t see that I will feel driven to watch it again down the road.",2024-01-27T10:42:28.975Z,466420,3 stars,0.47065266966819763

Currently it holds 10 nominations to the 96th Academy Awards (Best Picture, Director, Best Actress, Supporting Actor, Cinematography, Editing, Production Design, Costume Design, Original Score, Best Original Song).

It is based on the 2017 nonfiction book ""Killers of the Flower Moon""
by David Grann, that basically investigate the Osage Indian Nation that occurred between 1920 and 1930. Just as an outline oil was discovered on Osage lands in the end of 1800, but with the boom of automobile industry it value boomed, making the Osage people one of the most rich on Earth at that time, even if the jurisdictions of the legal rights were done by white man. Based on legal attributions and heritage marriage  occurring on that time a wide spread of sordid murders and interracial marriages between Indian woman and white men occurred putting a whole af the money in white mens blood dirty hands.

Of course being a 3 and a half hour project (after all not all stories can be condensed on 2 hours, and the rhythm is right), the second of Scorsese after 2019's ""The Irishman"" - the movie (which had the rights buyed in 2015 by 5M) was to start production in 2019, but obviously it halted because of COVID what gave Scorsese time to get the money for a USD 200M production (by Apple and Paramount) and started the works in 2021.

I will not enter in details of the characters here, but all is historically researched, and many details were affected by Osage contributions. On the Acting part, Leonardo DiCaprio, as Ernest Burkhart, Robert De Niro as William King Hale, Ernest's uncle and Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burkhart, Ernest's wife are just perfect.
 
The nominations of Cinematography (Rodrigo Prieto - Argo, The Irishman, Brokeback Mountain among other sublime works), editing (Thelma Schoonmaker), Production Design (Jack Fisk and Adam Willis), Costume Design	(Jacqueline West), Best Original Score (using musics from Indians and from that time, in a discrete, but at the same time prominent in the last work of Robbie Robertson) are all spot one.

Maybe the best achievement of the movie is bringing to the spotlights another history side of the evil side of USA, as Tulsa was in the same age.

The men and their legal team uncover a deliberate web of deception designed by insurance companies to scam poor people out of their money by taking advantage of them in their time of grief. In the process of exposing corporate corruption, Willie and Jeremiah learn that they have a lot to like and respect about each other.

It’s an irresistible story about legal system actually working the way it’s supposed to, and there are a lot of scenes featuring technical lawyer speak. It’s not dumbed down, which is refreshing, and the film features many scenes of legal strategy, brainstorming, and talk about business deals, burial insurance, and racial injustice. Thankfully it’s not as dry as it sounds, as Betts moves the timeline along quickly. She dives right into the lawsuit and the story, not wasting a lot of time setting things up.

Foxx is perfectly cast as a flamboyant attorney, and he’s entertaining to watch in the role. Willie is all about showmanship, and he’s a lawyer with a knack for communicating with common folk. Foxx emotes this with a natural charisma and effortless spirit, and it’s difficult to resist his character’s dazzling charm. Jones doesn’t have a whole lot to do, but he provides the quiet balance needed as a contrast to Foxx (and they make a great onscreen pair).

Since this is a courtroom legal drama, there are several scenes designed with the sole intention of emotionally manipulating the audience. Get ready for those gutsy monologues that are accompanied by corny dramatic music swells, or the requisite interaction where Willie at first refuses to take on Jeremiah’s case because the payday won’t be in the multi-million dollar range. It appears Betts suddenly had a change of heart and decided that she didn’t want to include every single courtroom cliché in her movie, however, because I was disappointed that there was no big, blustering closing argument scene.

If you are a fan of legal dramas and like stories where greedy corporations get their what-for, then you are going to enjoy “The Burial.” This is a solid, easy watch about helping the little guy stick it to those responsible for the rampant monetary shakedowns that can lead to the financial ruin of normal, hardworking citizens.

CinemaSerf,5.0,"Hilarious that on the day Amazon announce the introduction of ads (or a 35% uplift in your monthly fee) that this nonsense hits the small screen. It purports to be a comedy, but I'm not sure what language you'd have to be speaking in order to get any humour out of this contrived and weakly devised action ""thriller"". Journalist ""Claire"" (Alison Brie) hires security specialist ""Mason"" (John Cena) to accompany her on a trip to a jungle dictatorship where she is to interview the president. Upon arrival they meet the suave and debonaire ""Venegas"" (Juan Pablo Raba) who has his own golden gun - a little less subtle than that of Christopher Lee! Anyway, no sooner do they land than they find themselves caught up in a coup led by an ambitious but cowardly nephew and must now traipse through the jungle trying to stay one step ahead of the military and of the mercenaries who may or may not be on someone's side! This is just a badly conceived mess of a film with the mediocre acting matched only by some dreadful dialogue amidst a repetitive series of ambushes, shoot-outs and a denouement that rather summed up this confused and derivative story. It's too long, but I'm not sure where you'd stop cutting if you started, so I'd have to recommend that you just go find an episode or two of the ""A Team"" and sink some Malbec instead.",2024-01-03T17:53:46.114Z,897087,2 stars,0.5924215912818909
GenerationofSwine,1.0,"Well, they made The Exorcist woke... and oddly Anti-Catholic... and it flopped.

Seriously, The Pope's Exorcist was better and EVERYONE knew that was going to flop.  I'm going to tell you right now that you should go back and watch the prequel movies because they were better... BOTH of them.

You have two little girls, a strong anti-Catholic message, a strong anti-patriarchy message, you know... the usual Hollywood meh messaging (except the Anti-Catholic part, that is a dead horse that hasn't been beaten nearly as much) and, most importantly, the same sequel/reboot/franchise killer that seems to go out of it's way to insult all the fans of the original film...

... and everyone that helped make it.  Which, honestly, is also a dead horse that's been beaten too much these days.  In fact, insulting the original is sort of a trope these days.

People that actually like Terminator: Dark Fate are going to rave about this one... but everyone else is going to roll their eyes because at the end of the day, it has the exact same boring message as everything else.

And like everything else with that message, everything else from bookend to bookend takes a backseat to it.  Bad dialogue peppered with political lectures.  Bad acting (but let's be honest, they had nothing to work with) and in the end even the demon lacked the sardonic and vulgar wit of the first one.

But, hey, if you liked Dark Fate and thought The Rise of Skywalker was better than Empire, this movie is for you.

Luckily, the girls turn up in a cow-barn a few miles away but have no recollection of just what they had been doing for the three days they had been missing. Anyway, dad ""Victor"" (Leslie Odom Jr.) soon starts to notice some odd behaviour from his previously reasonable daughter and before we know it, she - and her friend - are showing worrying signs of a possession that resonates all too readily with events some fifty years earlier and that finds him seeking the help of ""Chris MacNeil"" (Ellen Burstyn) before the girls are Satanic toast. It's ten minutes shy of two hours long this, and that's about ninety minutes too long. The vast majority of this film is taken up by pointless preamble, family establishment scenarios and unfortunately the acting and writing are really lacklustre too. Burstyn only makes sparing appearances and Odom Jr. ought to just stick to singing. The last ten minutes is slightly better than standard Blumhouse fayre that concludes this completely unnecessary sequel with, admittedly, a couple of not so predicable twists, but still - with very little to make the preceding drudge worth watching.

Alunauwie,8.0,"Poison is the fourth film in Roald Dahl’s anthology series, known for its unique narration and visuals. The story centers on Harry, whose tense situation gradually unfolds, revealing underlying conflicts and growing discomfort between him and the doctor. The film’s clever use of camera angles and fitting sound effects intensify the suspense, while the unresolved presence of a snake serves as a powerful metaphor for Harry’s latent racism. Overall, Poison delivers an engaging and thought-provoking cinematic experience.

Cut from the same dark cloth as so, so many, seedy underbelly US crime drama's, the plot behind this film is all too familiar.That said, its saved from mediocrity, by its adherence to the basic premise its built upon and  plausible performances, from its cast. 

Indeed the subdued, very conventional approach taken to character development reminded more me of Swedish or UK series, where the characters are ordinary people, with mostly, ordinary lives. 

In summary, whilst Reptile isn't doing nothing new, its refreshingly down to earth approach to character development, does offer a little more to the viewer, than the conventional, ""by the numbers"", US crime drama.",2023-10-05T01:25:24.365Z,866463,3 stars,0.542413055896759
jw,7.0,"**cop/crime thriller, well executed. Nothing to get excited about, but above the rest.**


The leading couple, Del Toro and Silverstone, are well cast - not the unlikely ""what are these supermodels doing in this situations"", but a realistic looking middle-aged couple. Him weary but still strong, her chubby, cheerful and sensible. His country club dancing isn't winning prizes; he's called Oklahoma ""because he doesn't cut a rag"".
Their friends are a fun bunch, living a bit above their pay grade, ribbing, caring, and close.

After we get the scenery set, the crime starts: A real estate agent is bloodily murdered. Investigating the murder turns up more than one likely suspect. And nothing is quite as clear as one might wish.

The plot is complex enough but not convoluted; The characters are authentic and their portrayal is skillfully done. Direction, cinematography and editing maintain suspense. They don't irritate you with fashionable gimmicks, but instead allow us to concentrate on the story and the characters.

(Avoiding spoilers) The twists and turns aren't gimmicky either. Everything remains within the bounds of the probable and possible; and so the story maintains realism and therefore appears more intense.

I can recommend this as a solid, entertaining, suspenseful and above all realistic crime thriller.


One more thing: I've read the name ""Justin Timberlake"" a lot before. I thought he was a singer but never heard what he did. He is in this as an actor; and I have to say he plays his role well, like a professional. Not at all like some other singers who try this and end up embarrassing themselves.

MovieGuys,6.0,"Totally Killer, mixes a little 80's nostalgia, with a campy slasher flick.

Its not a bad formula and it mostly works, but only in a functional sense. That is, this film is competently done but the core cinematic elements that are supposed to help drive this film forward, are a little lacking in places.

The 80's nostalgia, one of the key ingredients, lacks flavour. That is to say, there is not a lot that speaks directly to the 1980's, save a dash of period specific music and a degree of political incorrectness, not seen in today's up tight society. I personally think they could have gone further and done a lot more, to really bring home that 80's atmosphere. 

The slasher side of this flick, is actually handled a lot better and even manages to throw in a twist, I did not seeing coming. So well done there.

Acting is above average too and that also helps to elevate this flick a smidgen above its numerous slasher film peers.Sensibly too, whilst Totally Killer, can be graphic it dodges being gruesome, which is appropriate given its black comedy vibe.

In summary, inherently watchable if you like the lighter side of horror/slasher flicks but fails to conjure enough 80's nostalgia to really make it special.",2023-10-12T04:02:55.648Z,974931,4 stars,0.5081793665885925

A 17 years-old teen in the Great Northwest (Kiernan Shipka) is intent on stopping a masked serial killer from 35 years earlier. 

“Totally Killer” (2023) is a dynamic and amusing slasher mixed with a lot of 80s-isms. If I said more, it’d give away important plot details, which are better left discovered for yourself. Let’s just say it’s a meshing of 80’s slashers like “Sweet Sixteen” and “Halloween IV” with the fun tone of “Peggy Sue Got Married.” A plus is that it effectively adds human interest despite the campiness.

Kiernan works well as the attractive, sassy protagonist while Julie Bowen is on hand as her mother. Liana Liberato (Tiffany) and Olivia Holt (Pam) are also worth a mention.

The movie runs 1 hour, 46 minutes, was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, including The Bridge Studios in linking Burnaby.

I saw Fair Play at Sundance 2023 in a crowd of cinema enthusiasts, making the theater experience electric and engaging! While Fair Play isn't my typical movie taste, it was exceptionally well done, with tension and stress building consistently from start to finish and exploding into all-out insanity and paranoia in the film's final act. My heart was pounding as the selfishness and jealousy of these characters devolved into pure hatred and disdain. Once the credits rolled, I finally felt like I could breathe for the first time in an hour! Domont did so much with so little, mastering suspense and keeping the audience on edge. With such arrogant and self-centered characters, it is hard to ""enjoy"" the film, but the craft and skill are undeniable, and it's no surprise why it was so well received at Sundance and scooped up so quickly by Netflix.",2023-02-11T05:57:42.121Z,910571,4 stars,0.35665372014045715
Brent Marchant,1.0,"It’s amazing how one film can be predictable, implausible and preposterous all at the same time, but writer-director Chloe Domont’s debut feature manages to pull off this trifecta of lamentable attributes with remarkable ease. This alleged psychological thriller goes from bad to worse as its plot hole-filled story degenerates from a boring, clandestine office romance into an over-the-top envy-driven battle of egos when one partner unexpectedly gets promoted over the other at a prestigious Wall Street firm. The way in which this unfolds, though, is largely laughable, despite an underlying message that has some noteworthy merit (even if it’s a bit trite in this day and age). The picture might be more worth watching if the two protagonists (Phoebe Dynevor, Alden Ehrenreich) weren’t so inherently deplorable and portrayed with some of the hammiest on-screen acting I’ve seen in a long time. This is all made worse by one of the most awful scripts I’ve come across in a while, with almost as much tawdry, needlessly foul language since “The Wolf of Wall Street” (2013). Put these qualities together and you’ve got an absolute work of utter trash that makes the prime time soap operas of the 1980s look like epic storytelling. Indeed, as far as how this one plays, all I can say is “No fair.”",2023-10-11T02:41:52.347Z,910571,2 stars,0.4806661009788513

Well, boss ""Campbell"" (Eddie Marsan) has other plans as he decides to give the job to her! Is he delighted? Well outwardly yes, but inwardly...? She is also uncertain. Not of her ability to do her new job, but of how to avoid bruising his increasingly obviously delicate ego. What now ensues is a rather fat-fetched eggshell dance that sees their relationship put under enormous pressure? Can it survive? Well, frankly I didn't care. The whole story seems contrived to create as much tension and distrust amongst the couple who at one stage are about to be married and at the next, well they might not cross the road to chat with each other. It takes a swipe at the greasy pole and at the whole corporate ""getting-on"" ethos, but in such a linear and unimaginative fashion. Way too many stereotypical attitudes and platitudes and by the end I was really quite uninterested in who got what, if anything, from this rather pedestrian and over-scripted melodrama.

""Fair Play is an emotionally charged exploration of love, ambition, and gender dynamics. Chloe Domont thoughtfully addresses these themes, highlighting biases faced by successful women, the personal challenges of couples working in the same space, and the inevitable vulnerabilities that arise from these scenarios.

The dedicated performances from Phoebe Dyvenor and Alden Ehrenreich make it a gripping viewing experience, emphasizing the film's thought-provoking messages about gender politics and seeking equal recognition based on merit rather than gender.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"If it sounds too good to be true then it probably is. That's what ""Kramer"" (Tobin Bell) ought to have thought when he was presented with a miracle cure for his terminal cancer by ""Cecilia"" (Synnøve Macody Lund) for a mere $250k. Anyway, off he goes to Mexico and then quickly discovers that it was all a con. A really cynical con at that, and so he decides that some gruesome revenge is due on the team that dreamt up this atrocious scheme. What now ensues is one of the best horror thrillers I've seen for ages. The assembled ""medical"" team find themselves tracked down, apprehended and then attached to some fairly ghastly devices in a sort of brutal version of the ""Adventure Game"". Great sacrifices are going to have to be made if any of them are to survive! Further complications follow when another victim of their scam - ""Parker"" (Steven Brand) turns up bent on his own kind of revenge... It's violent and brutal, this film, but we are spared the very worst of the graphic imagery and that actually helps us to do our own visualising as limbs start coming adrift. There's not a great deal of dialogue, which is good, and the score doesn't resort to the creation of jump moments for us - that's all left to our eyes and our imagination. There's a twist at the end but it's rather weak and does rather let the thing down a little. All told, though, this is very much at the better end of recent films in this genre and in a dark cinema is well worth two hours.",2023-10-09T03:49:37.351Z,951491,3 stars,0.5091540813446045

Brent Marchant,7.0,"The subject of artificial intelligence has been all over the news in recent months, with much of the coverage (save for what’s in the business/finance pages) presented in an often-troubling, cautionary light. So, from this, it’s easy to see how it  didn’t take long for this topic to make its way into the world of entertainment, as evidenced in writer-director Gareth Edwards’s latest feature offering. This tale about a brutal war between Asia and America over the future of this controversial technology leads to a series of epic revelations, including some that shift the prevailing view of the evils of AI (most notably exposing where the real source of concern about this technology lies). It also serves as a poignant metaphor for the nature of East-West geopolitical relations, the underlying tensions of the conflict represented by the superficial reasons cited as the cause of combat. And all of the foregoing considerations grow progressively stronger and more impressive as the story plays out. However, in the film’s prologue and opening act, the narrative comes across like an uninspired amalgamation of sci-fi tropes culled from an array of other movies and TV series, including “Blade Runner” (1982), “Edge of Tomorrow” (2014), “Oblivion” (2013), “I, Robot” (2004), “The Terminator” franchise and the rebooted version of Battlestar Gallactica (2004-2009), among others. Also, the story, much of which consists of an involved high-stakes pursuit, is overly stretched out at times, a quality that could have been improved upon with some judicious editing. To its credit, though, the picture features excellent special effects, a fair amount of smartly written comic relief and a surprisingly good cast for a sci-fi release (particularly protagonist John David Washington and youthful newcomer Madeleine Yuna Voyles, despite a seriously miscast Allison Janney in a supporting role as an overwrought member of the military brass). “The Creator” is indeed more insightful and thought-provoking than what many of its detractors have said, though it’s understandable how its periodic lapses in originality and inventiveness may be seen as undermining these strengths. Nevertheless, these shortcomings should be taken with a grain of salt, and the film should be given a fair shot for what it has to say about something that’s becoming an increasingly more significant aspect of our lives, something that we had better to learn to understand and live with if we hope to make friends with it as part of our existence going forward.",2023-10-05T09:12:56.764Z,670292,4 stars,0.42928391695022583

It's like a precursor to the ""Terminator"" films with ""Joshua"" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as ""Col. Howell"" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is ""Alphie"" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt.

I am surprised this film was made, in so much, as it shows exactly what the US military industrial complex, stands for. That is callous cruelty, violence, intolerance and death. 

In a sense then this film could be said to be set in any of the battlefields, in any Asian country, the US has invaded. The fact it has a futuristic overlay, does not detract from powerful and often moving, anti-war, pro peace message, it compellingly conveys. It could not be more timely either, given the US's attempts, to light wars across the world.

The positive: the visual both at scenes, characters or settings are just EXPLENDID, well done CG - just imagine Rogue One, but into this Asiatic setting that mixtures basic living and hi tech. All this was done with $80 million (box office: $101.8 million) a low budget compared to most of todays movies.

The negative: thought it have a good base to work with, the story is just too weak - the inspirations from ""Blade Runner' and 'Apocalypse Now', with a bit of ""Avatar"" thought other movies, just turned to be too shallow and predicable and we don't engage so much with the characters till the very near end. It's just...isn't developed enough. At some moments it even reminded me of ""Elysium"". Don't be fooled by the names cited here, they just shows what could be done.

The music is by Hans ZImmer - good, but not outstanding, and the cinematography by Greig Fraser (Dune) and Oren Soffer are good, but outshined by the visual effects.

The movie had a great potential, but was broke in the ain point, the story. But I consider that it is something to be watched because of the digital effects and production, as a basic that no movie must cost more than $ 100 million to have stellar visuals. 

For me the score is 6,0 out of 10,0 / B - C+.  The stars are for visual effects only.",2023-11-21T15:32:43.314Z,670292,3 stars,0.4573868215084076
ThisOver,-1.0,"""The Creator"" is a new film directed by Gareth Edwards, whose credits include 2014's ""Godzilla"" and ""Star Wars Story 1"". Will his new work go down in the annals of sci-fi cinema in gold?
 ""The Creator"" begins with a newsreel informing us that in 2055, a nuclear warhead was detonated in Los Angeles by an artificial intelligence. This prompted the US to ban the use and development of AI. However, not every country approaches AI in the same way. In Asia, AI is not banned. Fifteen years later, the military is on the hunt for Nirmata, the mysterious creator of artificial intelligence, who has now developed a new weapon that could turn the situation against America. Sergeant Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) is sent to the Republic of New Asia in search of Nirmata and the weapon, but is more eager to find his lost love Maya (Gemma Chan). Accompanied by soldiers, he finds neither Maya nor weapons - only a 'simulant' (the most advanced form of AI) in the form of a child with unique powers. Despite his hatred of AI - his family were killed in the LA explosion - Joshua has no choice but to pair up with this young girl, whom he calls Alphie, in the hope that she will lead him to his beloved Maya.


Watching The Creator, if you have experienced sci-fi cinema before, you will quite often have a sense of déjà vu, as the filmmakers have stitched together elements from numerous previous works of the genre. You will therefore find the spectre of plot ideas from such productions as Blade Runner, Akira, The Terminator, District 9 and even Apocalypse Now, Leon the Professional and Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line. And these are just a few examples. At the same time, the authors of ""The Creator"" have managed to put these elements together in such a skilful way that the whole is an independent, original achievement, although every now and then it is reminiscent of its great predecessors.

What we have here is a war with AI, road cinema, the story of a chosen one who is to save the world, or at least change the fate of the conflict. In the background, tragic love. Along the way, there is no armchair-pressing twist waiting for us, so 'The Maker' is, for all intents and purposes, a basically predictable work. But also fresh enough to hold the viewer's interest. At least in theory. The visuals are excellent (although too many of the spectacle scenes were shot in the dark - a constant problem for Hollywood, which thus solves the problem of costly fine-tuning of CGI effects). Edwards and the team have created a world of the near future that looks realistic. The action is largely set in Asia, which also adds to the exoticism of the whole thing and takes us away from the standard sci-fi cinema images. There's a kind of visual poetry and sensibility in 'The Creator' that you don't often find in this genre of cinema (and watching it on big IMAX screens, if you have the opportunity, only enhances this). The problem begins, however, when we get to the script. Because skilfully piecing together a script from classic sci-fi tropes (and more) is one thing, but creating an engaging and full-blooded story out of it all is another. I, unfortunately, did not find great layers of emotion in The Creator, although the filmmakers were clearly trying to emotionally engage the viewer.

I am sorry to say that I did not care about the fate of the main character. The problem lies partly in the script, but also partly in John David Washington himself, who plays him. Denzel's son may not be a bad actor, but he doesn't have even half the charisma of his father, on top of which his roles so far have been waspish every time, even when his characters weren't meant to be that way at all. I don't believe him when I see him concerned, scared, angry, loving. For me, he's an actor fit to play cold mercenaries in war films. There is a kind of indifference, an absence in his gaze. On top of this, the heart and soul of 'The Creator', as I understand it, was supposed to be in the forming relationship between Joshua and Alpha, but unfortunately I found it hard to believe in the emerging bond between them, as it was presented unconvincingly, rather rushed and a bit more along the lines that the viewer is just supposed to believe at some point that the two have taken a liking to each other, although we don't really see on screen when this happened or why. Also, the finale, while most impressive, feels chaotic, rushed and not entirely satisfying. Other than that it was easily predictable.",2023-11-22T08:34:47.529Z,670292,4 stars,0.46900177001953125

CrazyJekyll,4.0,"As a big film nerd going into The Creator, i was genuinely excited. I mean come on, its an original Sci-Fi film directed by Gareth Edwards with Greig Fraser as the DOP, who wouldn't love to see that?.

But right after finishing the movie i only felt disappointment. This movie from start to finish seemed hellbent on making the most safe and cliched choices possible leading to a lot of unearned and/or hollow emotional moments.

The visuals are obviously amazing. Edwards, Fraser, Seffer and their teams deserve huge credit for creating amazing imagery and worlds that would put 200-300 million blockbusters to shame. But no matter how amazing these visuals were, its generic plot and mediocre action barely thrilled and just dragged on and on and on.

I honestly would have forgiven the script if the action setpieces were as good as the visuals, but most of the action just felt too generic and every time i felt that the action was finally building up to something tight or gripping, the scene just suddenly ends. Cockblocking its audience of any thrills.

So by the end i just felt empty and bored.
There was nothing really memorable about the movie other than the visual world it created. It even cut the robot side kick that we see in the trailer. Like damn bro, where are my cool CQC robots??. There was just too much wasted potential here, and it just saddens me to say that The Creator to me was just a huge letdown.

If you want to watch John David Washington kicking ass i highly recommend Tenet. Not only was he way more charismastic in it, but it also has great action, story, and a goddamn satisfying ending.",2025-07-15T13:50:03.809Z,670292,2 stars,0.6908394694328308

Having been introduced to the PAW Patrol characters by my son earlier this year, I was pleasantly surprised by their charm and appeal. After watching the first movie with my son, I found the sequel to be even better, with the addition of superpowers adding an exciting twist to the storyline.

The movie delves into Sky's origin story, revealing poignant moments from her youth that add depth to her character. While some of these moments may be sad, the overall narrative is well-written and engaging, making it a great watch for young children.

One aspect that detracted from the experience was the short film for Dora the Explorer that preceded the PAW Patrol movie, which I found to be overly childish and not to my liking.

Despite this minor setback, the PAW Patrol movie is a cute and entertaining choice for families with young children. The film's spectacular animation and engaging storyline make it a delightful watch that promises fun and enjoyment for both kids and parents alike.",2024-09-08T03:53:31.403Z,893723,4 stars,0.723012387752533

This film is driven by sight and sound, evoking a Rockwell flavoured 50's charm, juxtaposed starkly, with an austere, almost Lovecraft-ian alien other. Its a film that's as endearing familiar as its, terrifyingly other worldly and it works beautifully. 

The end is intriguing too, raising questions what it means to be saved and who the real aliens, are.

In summary, clever in its simplicity, visually and audibly expressive, at times familiar and terrifying, balanced by a thought provoking finale.  Great stuff.",2023-09-27T01:39:29.866Z,820609,5 stars,0.6400957107543945

whitsbrain,8.0,"It's a new kind of home invasion story. And I guess it's a new kind of alien invasion story. About two-thirds of the way through, I finally realized that there had not been one word of dialogue spoken. The fighting between the alien nasties and Brynn was sometimes spooky, often suspenseful, and always entertaining. Brynn's home was the perfect place to stretch out the chases and the games of hide and seek between her and the aliens.

The variety in size of the aliens was a nice touch. They came in three different sizes: dog-sized, human-sized, and kaiju-sized. Their quirky movements and strangely jointed arms and legs, not to mention their odd feet were pretty creative. Their movements were sometimes human and often monkey or even spider-like. The CGI was pretty good, but the aliens looked a bit like plastic too often. To be fair, they were not human, so I guess anything goes.

The final 20 minutes was frustrating because things turned a bit dreamy as opposed to the haunting with all of the menace it delivered for the entire run of the movie up to that point. The final couple of minutes, though, delivered an interesting twist on the actual purpose for the invasion. This is a really fun movie with some scares, some action and some unanswered questions. I'll definitely be looking to buy this on physical media if it's released that way. It's a keeper.",2024-01-30T20:04:59.570Z,820609,4 stars,0.4851181209087372
RalphRahal,8.0,"No One Will Save You is a really intriguing and engaging movie that kept me hooked throughout. The cinematography is excellent, with every shot making you curious about what’s coming next and how the aliens might act. Brian Duffield did a great job directing this one, and it feels like one of his stronger projects.

Kaitlyn Dever’s performance stood out. Since the movie has almost no dialogue, it relies heavily on her ability to convey emotions through her expressions and actions, and she does it really well. It’s not easy to carry a story without words, but she made it work and kept me invested in her character.

The ending definitely caught me off guard. Duffield has a knack for surprising his audience, and while it wasn’t what I expected, it left me thinking about the story long after it ended.

Overall, it’s a solid movie that’s worth watching. It’s not perfect, but it’s unique, well-directed, and has a great performance from Kaitlyn Dever. If you enjoy suspenseful and unconventional sci-fi, you’ll probably enjoy this one too.",2024-12-17T16:22:25.254Z,820609,4 stars,0.7720928192138672

CinemaSerf,6.0,"To be perfectly honest, I have never quite understood how you could make money buying stock in a company that you actually wanted to go bust! I watched this and I'm still not really any the wiser. It all centres around the internet influencer Keith Gill (Paul Dano) who quite fancied the undervalued stock in a video game store called ""GameStop"". He started to suggest to his followers that this was a decent buy - despite the fairly obvious fact that the venture capitalists were selling the company short with a view to it collapsing. Slowly but surely the word spreads and the stock starts to rise. What now ensues is a worm that turns story as the gazillionaires at their polo clubs find these gadfly small investors really are becoming a fly in their vichyssoise. Can the little guy prevail? This is quite an enjoyably paced drama with it's roots in reality but for me, the acting was really lacklustre and it drew a really simplistically linear distinction between the have and the have nots that didn't really intrigue my brain. It certainly demonstrates the power of the internet and that galvanising the population can easily buck some established business practices but somehow I didn't especially admire the little guys here either - they were to varying degrees just as aspirational, wanted what the rich guys had and didn't much care how they got it!

Thing is, tragedy strikes very early on in the film and ""Christmas"" is taken off the team that is sent to avenge that. Is he staying home to fester? Of course not, and lucky too - for soon he is trying to free his pals from captivity before all hell breaks loose. Plenty of pyrotechnics, a bit of contrived sexual chemistry (with Megan Fox's ""Gina"") and loads of bullets and missiles flying around keep the film moving along well enough, but the story is the thinnest of the thin; the baddie's identity is hardly a challenge to discover nor is the twist in the tale at the end remotely unexpected.

By contrast, the latest flick is easily forgettable with a good number of cast members, I've never heard of or seen on screen, infrequently.

Jason Statham and Sylvester Stallone (who is strangely, given he is the series' star, sidelined) are a solid pairing, while Megan Fox does quite well throughout - her best performance that I've seen, admittedly I haven't yet checked out anything with her in a lead role; <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/transformers/"" rel=""nofollow"">Transformers</a>'</em> (meh) aside.

Brent Marchant,3.0,"The one thing a good whodunnit should not do is put its audience to sleep. Unfortunately, this latest cinematic adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel fails miserably on this score. Director Kenneth Branagh’s third outing as Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot is a protracted snooze that leaves viewers caring little about the characters and even less about the story in which they’re trapped. When the famed detective (Branagh) – now in retirement in Venice – is called upon by a friend and author of murder mysteries (Tina Fey) to help her verify or discredit the psychic powers of a medium (Michelle Yeoh) at a séance at an allegedly haunted Venetian palazzo, he’s drawn into yet another of his famous investigations. The problem here is that what should be an engaging story is interminably dull, one that, regrettably, prompts frequent checking of one’s watch. Moreover, virtually the entire film is shot with excessively dark camera work (so much for showing off the glories of Venice). And then there are the performances, which feature good turns by Yeoh and Jude Hill but a positively wooden portrayal by Branagh (compared to his previous depictions of the protagonist) and an absolutely dreadful performance by a woefully miscast Fey. To its credit, like its recent predecessors, the production values of this Christie offering are top shelf, but that’s about all this release has going for it, a far cry from the much better overall work found in “Murder on the Orient Express” (2017) and “Death on the Nile” (2023). Indeed, even fans of the famed mystery writer are likely to find “A Haunting in Venice” tiresome and tedious. Pack a lunch for this one.",2023-09-17T00:30:22.649Z,945729,2 stars,0.5890437960624695

""A Haunting in Venice is, by some margin, the best adaptation of the now trilogy featuring Hercule Poirot, correcting many of the mistakes of the past and utilizing Kenneth Branagh's innate talent as both filmmaker and actor to stand out as a darker, more atmospheric film.

Exceptional performances, suspenseful sequences with intense build-ups, and a couple of genuinely intriguing mysteries that last until the very end. Some ambiguity surrounding its supernatural themes feels off in such a logic-driven world, just as not all characters deserve the allocated screen time.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Unlike his other two Christie adaptations featuring this character, this film does not have a previous, star-studded, version with which to compare. That's a good thing because this is certainly not one of the author's stronger stories. ""Poirot"" (Sir Kenneth Branagh) has retired to a sort of self-imposed exile in Venice where he sees nobody but the pastry chef. The arrival of fellow writer ""Ariadne"" (Tina Fey) teases what's left of his little grey cells and takes them to an old palazzo where there is to be a seance to try and ascertain what caused the strange death of the young ""Alicia"". He quickly discovers that those assembled consist a group of folks who all have baggage - individually, or with others from the party and of course, in the best ""Cleudo"" style, one of them is duly murdered in a nigh-on impossible fashion. The last ten minutes of this is quite quirky and as usual with this writer we are presented with a fairly left-field solution, but I found the bulk of the remainder of the mystery to be presented in a stylish and classy-looking, but ponderous and lethargic fashion. It's way too wordy and the cast don't really gel together particularly well as the sense of peril really doesn't accumulate very much at all. It's nicely scored and shows off the beauty and the vulnerability of Venice but as a whodunnit, I felt it just lacked a little je ne sais quoi! Sir Kenneth is definitely trying to create a persona for his detective, and I am warming to that slightly (though he's no Peter Ustinov) but I found the writing rather too dry and I didn't really manage to get into this.

Much improved over Death on the Nile, this one gives us interesting establishing shots of the titular Venice before we get to the haunted Pallazo where the majority of the film takes place.

BornKnight,7.0,"Another take on Agatha Christie's books, this one takes the ""Hallowe'en Party"" (1969), into the screen on a loose adaptation. Again 
Kenneth Branagh leads on the direction and main role (the belgian detective Hercule Poirot), while on his retirement in Venice, in post-war Venice, 1947.

The screenplay is by Agatha Christie (obviously) and Michael Green (Blue Eyed Samurai, Blade Runner 2049, Logan, and the previous two movies of this series ""The Murder on the Orient Express - 2017, and Death in the Nile - 2022). 

It is a way better movie than Death in the Nile, but it doesn't reach the level of Orient Express tho. In all passes in a dark Venice palazzo, in a strange empty Venice, that is shown only into the begging and the end (that were actually shots on a London Studio as much of the movie). The CGI effects are really nice into deleting modern things (and actual tourist) nto some obvious closed famous spots on close angle shots. 

The cinematography of Haris Zambarloukos (another close colleague into Branagh works like the previous movies and Belfast) is really beautiful, even into the dark settings that can be into closed spaces or huge claustrophobic rooms. I've read somewhere that the actors weren't aware when something like a closing door, etc would happen, but I bet that after the first one the trick didn't work again.

On the story side, Branagh is spot on Poirot again. The story follows the usual premise of a crime with several characters involved, but I killed the charade into mid-movie (knowing how usually Agatha Christie Stories area - I can't really compare to the book as I didn't even read it). But it is enjoyable anyway if is that that you search.

The story plus acting and beautifully well done cinematography and settings ensure a 7,0 out of 10,0 / B on my score. How I miss to see Venice again.",2023-11-13T14:11:36.007Z,945729,3 stars,0.5398685336112976

This film initially presents itself as a horror movie but unfolds more as a murder mystery, deviating from the expectations set by its promotional material. It shares similarities with other movies starring the same actor in a recurring character role, resembling a continuation of a franchise with a different name.

While the first two movies were decent, this one falls into the same category. It doesn't quite captivate or hold your attention throughout. The storyline feels somewhat lacking and could benefit from filling in some plot holes. Overall, it's an okay movie that doesn't excel in drawing the audience in.

The predictability of the plot and clues may leave viewers feeling ahead of the protagonist, diminishing some of the suspense. Ultimately, this film seems more suited for streaming rather than a theatrical viewing. It may not be worth the expense of a cinema ticket.",2024-09-02T20:40:47.290Z,945729,3 stars,0.7676963210105896
CinemaSerf,5.0,"Well I reckon I deserve a pat on the back for actually struggling through this franchise that makes the ""Twilight"" films look like Pulitzer prize winning stuff. We continue to follow the hugely disinteresting love antics of the dreary ""Hardin"" (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) who, having lost the love of ""Tessa"" (Josephine Langford) had a one night stand with ""Nathalie"" (Mimi Keane) that ended up on the internet. Needless to say, she wasn't best pleased and so now, some time after, he heads to Portugal to try to make amends (and so the crew can get some sun). Of course what he really wants is to reunite with ""Tessa"" but can he grow up enough to realise the errors of his ways and to reconcile with her? Well I really could not have cared less. Initially I found Tiffin to have a little charm about him, but now this part has been well and truly exhausted and he has neither that charm nor any charisma to bring to a role that really consists of a pretty odious and self-indulgent character. There's lots of familial discord, an on/off drink problem (probably for us watching, too) and the ending was more like a sigh of relief for all concerned. I know, I'm not the demographic - but money has been spent on this - and it's money that could have been better spent on - well, just about anything.

THE NUN II surpasses its predecessor with commendable acting, improved practical effects, and impressive imagery, making it a surprisingly decent horror blockbuster. Michael Chaves effectively utilizes his budget, showcasing well-directed, suspenseful sequences.

However, it stumbles in the second act with a loss of momentum and still overuses generic jumpscares that often fall flat. The unnecessary complexity introduced in the story, including weird flashbacks and character intricacies, leads to a somewhat messy third act narratively.

Despite these issues, this sequel represents a positive step forward for the franchise, although I doubt it will ever go back to the peak of the first two The Conjuring films.""

I mainly dislike The Nun character, both in terms of how it looks visually and how it is portrayed audibly - just such a disappointment, <em>'The Curse of La Llorona'</em> did it greater... not that many would agree with me, admittedly. The human side of all this isn't much better either.

Dakota Fanning appears now and again in a rather unnecessary sub-plot involving the CIA and some Syrian narcotics smugglers that is really undercooked - but for the most part this is really just Denzel being, well, Denzel on his quest to save his new-found friends from the grip of the unscrupulous Camorra.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,8.0,"Yesterday evening me and the kids, well the two boys at least, sat down to watch The Equalizer 3 which has been sitting on my to-watch shelf for a while.

I have quite liked the previous two instalments and this was was a quite good movie as well.

It starts of with a fairly brutal, The Equalizer style, slaying of a bunch of bad guys but then McCall gets shot in the back by a kid and goes into a bit of a funk.

The entire movie slows down quite a bit after that while McCall goes around moping. It was actually a bit boring and I could have been without that.

Still, McCall is McCall and the movie does pick up speed again after a while.

There are some quite nice action scenes as we approach the ending and the way McCall disposes of the bad guys towards the end is quite brutal.

When I saw that the movie had an R-rating in the states I thought, yeah right this is another one of these movies where they show a boob or two or use adult language and then the easily offended whiners go all must-be-restricted-bullshit over it but I guess it was because of the brutal slayings after all.

Still, in France it got a restricted from 12 years and below which is far from an R-rating and more reasonable. Guess we got less whining asshats here.

Overall a good movie though. Technically, the filming and the acting was very good. If not for the boring parts for almost half the movie it might have gotten a 5 out of 5 from me.",2024-02-18T10:20:53.011Z,926393,4 stars,0.578372061252594

The story depicted in <em>'The Equalizer 3'</em> is surprisingly straightforward, it's literally just Robert McCall reactively killing bad guys for almost two hours... so what's not to enjoy?! Denzel Washington in the lead role is as ace as he is in the prior flicks, I am yet to watch a less than good Denzel picture; 15 films deep into his filmography, what an actor!

I don't recall the previous two movies from this trilogy featuring as many brutal deaths as this one does, which is great. I could be misrembering but, whatever, I really enjoyed seeing McCall do his thing in this one. The music is also noteworthy, while the Italian setting is splendidly portrayed - terrific choice of location! The support cast are inferior to Washington, naturally, but still solid, cool to see Dakota Fanning reunite onscreen with the aforementioned.

End of the trilogy it seems, though there are murmurs on potentially more films in some sorta way - hardly unexpected. As for these three, 2 is my favourite followed by this and then 1. Antoine Fuqua (also yet to see a less than very good movie from him, from 7 watched) and Washington are evidently a top notch pairing, either way.",2024-05-13T00:56:21.494Z,926393,4 stars,0.5577391982078552
Brent Marchant,1.0,"I hate to admit it, but I allowed myself to be suckered in to this one as a result of its rambunctiously funny trailer only to be grossly disappointed at what I saw. This is a positively dreadful film, and I’m at a complete loss to understand how viewers have found it funny. When a pair of lesbian high school students (Rachel Sennott, Ayo Edebiri) establish a fight club (i.e., a euphemistically labeled “self-defense program”) as a means to surreptitiously bed down their cheerleader classmates (a story line that’s more than a little dubious in itself), they subsequently launch into a meandering narrative that makes little sense and plays like it was made up by a group of stoners who’ll laugh at anything when suitably smoked up. The film starts out trying way too hard and then proceeds to quickly go downhill from there. Much of the material is in questionable taste, too, such as sequences that feature unrestrained physical abuse against women, as well as other forms of sanctioned violence. How is this stuff supposed to be funny? “Bottoms” has been described by viewers and critics as a go-for-broke/anything-for-a-laugh comedy, but I found its distasteful stabs at humor cringeworthy at best. What’s more, the picture’s feeble attempts at trying to inject the narrative with a message related to women’s empowerment are completely betrayed by its many wrong-headed plot devices. To the film’s credit, it does feature some passable performances by its supporting cast (most notably Punkie Johnson, Dagmara Dominczyk and former NFL star Marshawn Lynch). But, sadly, this effort is a big step down for director Emma Seligman and writer-actor Rachel Sennott, both of whom turned in brilliant work in their raucous collaboration, “Shiva, Baby” (2020) (not to mention that Sennott’s casting represents a laughable choice for someone who’s nearly 28 attempting to portray an 18-year-old character). It’s also quite a comedown for producer Elizabeth Banks, who scored big earlier this year with the utterly hilarious “Cocaine Bear.” It occurred to me after watching this debacle that maybe I’m just getting old and losing my sense of humor, but, after thinking it over, I realized that’s genuinely not the case. This may indeed represent a case of changing movie tastes, but, if that’s so, I’m seriously troubled about the direction in which those tastes are headed.",2023-09-06T00:30:33.040Z,814776,1 star,0.4894774556159973

Meantime, cheating school heart-throb ""Jeff"" (Nicholas Galitzine) is having a row with his girlfriend ""Isabel"" (Havana Rose Liu) that sees the latter take refuge with the girls in their car and the most minuscule of car accidents reduce this macho lad to a gibbering wreck! This is what inspires our duo to start a club at school that will ostensibly teach young women the basics of self defence whilst allowing them to maybe get some ""fun"" into the bargain! What now ensues is all rather puerile, I found. Maybe it's supposed to be satire, but that any school would allow the pupils to use the gym to beat each other up - under the supervision of a teacher - is just preposterous. The characterisations are just about as shallow as you can get and the writers need to appreciate that using the full gamut of Anglo-Saxon expletives doesn't actually make a film funny. As it lumbers on it becomes more and more cringe-worthy until a denouement that is just like something left on the cutting room floor from an edition of ""Happy Days"".

For a while, here, Nimród Antal sustains a degree of menace as the mystery unfolds, but sadly - once it does, it's pretty obvious whom the protagonist actually is and the proceeding car chases make the art of simple urban road-blocking by the German police look just a little amateurish! The last twenty minutes are especially disappointing with a denouement that's not short on pyrotechnics but is short on just about everything else.

Blue Beetle follows the usual superhero origin formulas, being extremely predictable, and lacking narrative creativity, but all these issues are well-compensated by a proudly Latino cast that offers exceptionally genuine performances - Xolo Maridueña is quite impressive - and by the magnificently rich Mexican culture that encompasses the film. Entertainment is also guaranteed due to a good mix of CGI action with choreographed fight sequences, as well as an energetic score (Bobby Krlic).

A movie that nonsensically finds itself labeled as part of the DCEU when it clearly belongs to the saga. James Gunn probably didn't want to risk starting the DCU with a lesser-known character, which is an understandable reason, but keeping it attached to a soon-to-be-extinguished cinematic universe is very questionable.

Fortunately for all of us, her cleaning lady likes to use the luxury bathroom at her home, and when she is caught and quite literally dumped, she and her brother find themselves out of work and introduced to ""Jenny"" (Bruna Marquezine) - the strong-minded niece of our baddie - who is determined to thwart the militarisation of her daddy's company.  She smuggles the gadget out of their HQ and manages to pass it to the rather earnest and drippy brother ""Jaime"" (Xolo Maridueña) with strict instructions not to even open the box.

This has all the feel to it of a standard television movie. Great visual effects but lightning pyrotechnics, cleaving a bus in half and endless explosions are no longer enough to sell a film. There has to be some semblance of originality with the thing. Aside from it's bilinguality, this has precious little by way of innovation to shout for it. The characters are largely forgettable - especially the annoying uncle ""Rudy"" (George Lopez) who's astonishing adeptness with all things super-tech was just plain daft! It's also way, way too long and I felt the ominous presence of a sequel looming at the end quite sad.

However, across the second half of the film I could feel myself gradually becoming more invested in the events onscreen.

Much of the cast match each other in terms of standard, they all try and subsequently produce solid displays. I will say that I really enjoyed George Lopez's performance as Rudy, he brings a lot of life and humour to the film via that role.

Xolo Maridueña is more than decent as the titular character, while Bruna Marquezine makes for a good match alongside Maridueña; even if her character's Kord family portion of the story didn't interest me as much as the Reyes', in that sense the less said about Susan Sarandon the better here - extremely meh, at best.

I very much wouldn't say the filmmakers hit the ball out of the park with this 2023 release, but I can certainly see potential with the character going forward - given they are reportedly planning to continue with him within the DCU. As for this, it's a serviceable superhero watch.",2023-11-20T04:00:07.041Z,565770,3 stars,0.5637537240982056

scherbakovx,8.0,"Movie is really good, but there is one obvious flaw and one important condition:

Flaw: you'll have to endure every scene about Jann's relationships. With the parents it's just very predictable — just try to imagine, they didn't believe in him and persuaded to drop his dreams and find proper job. Of course, you know what will happen in the end. Okay, relationships with parents are always important, but WHY DID THEY ADD SCENES WITH THE GIRLFRIEND? Thanks for showing Tokyo during their weekend there, but I still can't understand the reason to add her in the first place — they didn't have conflicts, interesting dialogues or even support, really. I'm sure creators could invest time to more interesting and important topics.

But anyway, this flaw disappears in the shadow of other, actually important stuff. Racing.

So yeah, let's return to the condition: you have to love it when cars go BRRRRR. The main reason behind this movie is to sell you GT7 for your PS5, and believe me, after leaving the cinema, you'll at least check if there are any discounts for the game right now (yes, there are). Sound, shooting angles, tension during races — everything works perfectly and beyond! Just when you become bored, you'll be in for a surprise. When you want a new angle, you'll get it. When you forget who the sponsor of the movie is, you'll see graphics from the video game.

So, just believe me, if you love races, you have to go to the movie right now. Just select cinema with quality sound, please :)

Manuel São Bento,8.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.firstshowing.net/2023/review-neill-blomkamps-gran-turismo-is-such-an-enjoyable-surprise/

""Gran Turismo is one of the most exciting surprises of the year! Being completely unaware of the inspirational true story on which the movie is based made it even more fascinating, engaging, and wildly exhilarating. Lorne Balfe and Andrew Kawczynski's score contains countless tracks loaded with extremely high levels of adrenaline that transform all racing sequences into moments of pure entertainment.

Exceptional performance by David Harbour, who commits himself to his role in such a way that, if the awards season started now and there was no clear dependence on marketing campaigns, the actor would be one of the frontrunners.

I strongly recommend not researching anything about the real story *before* the film, even if just to avoid dealing with the predictable, formulaic structure of this type of movie.""

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Archie Madekwe is quite good here as the gamer Jann Mardenborough who entered a competition devised by Nissan marketing man Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom) to raise the profile of their sports cars in a league usually dominated by the likes of Porsche and Ferrari etc. There's a great degree of cynicism from the high-pressure, high-octane, industry that these glorified couch potatoes could ever make the grade, but with the help of slightly jaded but experienced coach Jack Salter (David Harbour) they decide to push these youngsters to their limits. What now ensues is based on fact, so we have little jeopardy to the ultimate denouement. That said, though, Neill Blomkamp manages to build the momentum well with some excellent action photography to get the adrenalin pumping. Neither Bloom nor Harbour are really here nor there, but the young Madekwe does manage to exude some of the grit and determination of his ambitious, fiercely competitive, and dedicated persona and it's been quite a while since I heard the dulcets of Enya emanate from a big screen. It does take a little while to get out of neutral - maybe just a bit too much familial scene setting to justify the fees of Geri Horner and Djimon Hounsou but once we escape that, the thing picks up entreatingly and is quite a thrill a times to watch. Definitely better on a big screen.",2023-08-25T08:32:10.595Z,980489,4 stars,0.5446487069129944

Big fan of the game since PS1 till that day. Trailer gave me no thrills so i was expecting nothing but no! Way worse than trailer. 
Guys ! Even GT (is a half-sim) has some reality way more than this. For starters Whats with the Hungaroring? Silverstone Academy is reverse Hungaroring, Le Mans (La Sarthe) is regular Hungaroring.... 
In racing there is no wiggly helmets; cars don't explodes, engines do, there are no spotters except ovals!; track races have qualies, you don't start in the middle of nowhere; you dont pass your opponent with down shifts and sudden throttle; GT3 cars are fast as any car on straights; Le Mans 24H doesn't finish at the last lap; it finishes at the end of 24 hours + 1 lap; Nurburgring is 20.83 km and if you crash in the middle of it nobody waves yellow flags in start-finish straight. I could have add more but i am already bored. 
Good soundtrack, good cinematography, well blended CGI but no soul and no technical aspect. I don't even know how Yamauchi San gave his blessing to this as himself a real deal racing driver.

""Heart of Stone is a film of distinct halves. The first hour contains an intriguing narrative filled with surprising twists, fast pacing, and exciting stunts shot in real locations.

This is very much your standard, derivative, run of the mill, action fare with a Mission Impossible vibe and a female lead.

MovieGuys,7.0,"Last Voyage of the Demeter, manages to wring every creepy last drop, out of what is, a rather limited setting. 

This is a disturbing film in many respects. It takes the myth of Dracula as envisioned by Bram Stoker and makes something fundamentally primal, awful and genuinely chilling, out of it. 

This vampire is not your polite, European, with dental problems but more your monstrous Nosferatu.Its a sensible choice, as it amps ups the fear factor, in what is,the confined setting of a ship.

Acting is top shelf too and really adds depth to what is already, a more than decent, horror film. 

The only real downside is a few inconsistencies in the plot. Two of the characters go to investigate the crates, where they suspect the vampire dwells. One says she has no idea how to kill the vampire, having observed a crew member, who was bitten, burning in daylight. Indeed, why would the other character, who asks the question, apparently a doctor, not be more observant too? The captain and the remaining crew, are left out of this dangerous expedition, why? Why too, go at night, in the knowledge that this is when the vampire is out and about, taking compulsory blood donations?

In summary, an above average horror film that's truly creepy, disturbing and chilling. Perhaps only limited a little by the confines of its setting and a few, rather obvious, plot holes.That said, I still rate this a decent watch, if you enjoy vampire films.",2023-09-03T08:32:24.590Z,635910,4 stars,0.5996983051300049

""The Last Voyage of the Demeter breathes new life into the Dracula narrative, offering a surprisingly fresh take on the classic tale. This adaptation stands out with exceptional makeup work, impressively relying on real, practical effects instead of succumbing to the CGI trend. A remarkable choice that adds realism to the gruesome scenes filled with gore, bloody kills, and shocking imagery. Director André Øvredal's willingness to make bold decisions deserves much praise, as do the claustrophobic, eerie atmosphere and a potent score that avoids the formulaic build-ups to jumpscares. Gorgeously shot with excellent control of dark lighting and commendable VFX. Despite its strengths, the film overstays its welcome, falling into a somewhat predictable structure. A notable frustration arises from the nonsensical decision to reveal the ending in the opening sequence without substantial justification, leaving a lingering dissatisfaction with an otherwise daring, visually striking, highly entertaining horror flick.""

BornKnight,6.0,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter is a movie directed by André Øvredal (Troll Hunters, 2010, The Autopsy of Jane Doe, 2016), that tells basally the prologue of 1897's Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" (1847-1912) that tells about the Captain's Log of the Bulgarian ship named after the movie tile in 1867, before the events that happens in England.

Bragi Schut Jr. that took almost 20 years to put the idea to a movie adapted the text to a full screenplay (Escape Room, Velvet Road) and there may reside the big flaw of the movie, because the rhythm is inconsistent and the plot even being interesting moves very slowly, with many flaws. It tries to emulate an ancient Alien the 8th passenger movie to this claustrophobic setting.

Maybe the worst mistake was to put a protagonist Corey Hawkins in the role of the afro-english doctor Clemens that survives the trip and will start the hunt for Dracula, this already show in a pre-credits scene where the doctor is on a bar and see's the shadowy figure of Dracula, alrey telling the viewers that will de a sequence, on cinema or streaming.

Nothing to say about the well know story - a massacre of the tripulation of the ship, that consists with the book, and the arrival at the destiny as a wreck with the coffin containing earth of Dracul's ""bed"" (I wonder if it sunk in the middle of the Atlantic what would happened - no earth, but no no sunlight so...anyway:). 

After some gruesome assassinations on the ship, is obvious that somebody would be suspicious of each other, but not in the scale they happen, The mouse and cat cat between Dracula (in his man-bat form) and crew is the main core of the movie. 

Göran Lundström made the wonderful prosthetic work that was used almost 100% oon the scenes with dracula only using CG to put the artist that interpreted it  on the creature (that is very similar to the one at Midnight Mass at Netflix)

Beside the prosthetics and some scenes, the movie is too slow, and the final is ridiculous. I would give it a score of 6,0 out of 10,0 / B- by the effort.",2023-11-18T14:01:42.416Z,635910,3 stars,0.4377506971359253
whitsbrain,6.0,"The voyage of Dracula across the seas to London was a tale that I always wanted to see put to film. Unfortunately, this movie did not put enough of an emphasis on this actually being Dracula. Yes, it was stated in the movie by the characters, and some of the lore was set up at the start, but once they set sail on the Demeter, it turned into another demon-beast just killing victims.

Dracula's monstrous form looked great, there just wasn't enough of the ""human"" part of him portrayed. The movie looked good, and the characters were interesting enough that they were not just monster fodder. Maybe there wasn't enough Dracula-as-a-plague, either. It was constantly stated that he needed to feed, but that's not the same as his bat and rat, disease-carrying, rabid animal characteristics.",2024-01-30T19:50:42.286Z,635910,2 stars,0.47212421894073486
Niko,5.0,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter has a huge amount of wasted potential. The setting is atmospheric and the cast is decent. The real downside to it is that it shows way too much way too early. The suspense and mystery is killed by completely unveiling the ""bad guy"" in the first third of the movie and it unfortunately devolves into a B-movie adjacent creature flick from there on.

I'm not one to complain about characters making dumb choices for the sake of the story in a horror movie, but I think this one really turns it up to eleven. I don't recall a single film in recent memory that had the main characters make such consistently wrong decisions throughout and it kinda turned into eye rolling in the last third.

Overall I really wanted to like it, because the setting and theme was intriguing. It's not a horrible movie by any means, but it's a shame to see how close it came to being good, just to end up being pulled back into mediocrity.",2024-09-15T23:56:00.316Z,635910,2 stars,0.510457456111908

CinemaSerf,5.0,"Now the ""Meg"" (2018) itself could never be called a good film, but it is a great deal better than this muddled and derivative effort.

The team now travel to a remote installation where they must investigate some more of the beasties that live below the frozen layer put there by nature to ensure than we don't mix. Thing is, it seems they are not the only folks who've hit on the idea that there might be untapped riches 25,000 feet below the surface, and soon our team are involved in a contretemps with ""Montes"" (Sergio Peris-Mencheta) that introduces treachery, double-dealing and causes explosions galore that release not just megs, but also an enormous octopus into the ocean where they can merrily terrorise the holidaymakers on the nearby resort of ""Fun Island"". Can ""Jonas"" et al manage to take on four of these super-creatures before they've snacked their way through the tourists? This might have been a bit better if they'd just cut all the preamble and gone straight to the rig and to the underwater action, big fish and pyrotechnics. As it is, we spend far too long meandering about on the surface meeting the characters and there's way too much pointless dialogue throughout - though one or two half-hearted witticisms and puns help a little - before an ending that is entirely predictable and really rather processionally so. The acting is just banal, the continuity is all over the place - as is the editing - and the huge chunk of Ali Baba money that's floated this thing ensures that the switches from the English to Chinese languages actually smacks more of keeping everybody happy in the boardroom rather than engaging anyone in the actual cinema. Simply, even the charismatic Statham cannot rescue this from the doldrums of CGI-led mediocrity that churns out an unremarkable hybrid of ""Jaws"" and ""Jurassic Park"". It does need a big screen.

This movie isn’t meant to be serious or realistic, it’s a popcorn flick through and through. If we judged every movie on plausibility, most would fail spectacularly.

That's a big problem, given he is the glue that ought to hold these films together. In fact, the best person in this flick is Page Kennedy, who is amusing and has one cool fight scene; good (if minimal) character development, that. Sophia Cai and Cliff Curtis remain the best of the rest.

garethmb,-1.0,"The popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Franchise has taken a break from the recent live-action updates and has returned to animation to reboot and modernize the franchise.

“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” is a loving and updated look at the story as Seth Rogen and his creative team have shaken up the franchise but remained true to the core characters and universe.

The film follows the four Turtles Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Raphael (Brady Noon), Donatello (Micah Abbey), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), who are looking to find acceptance in the world despite their father Splinter (Jackie Chan), warning them not to trust humans and that they will never be accepted.

As typical teens do, the boys frequently rebel to sneak out and use their Ninja skills to travel New York to do tasks ranging from shopping to watching outdoor movies which only fuels their desires to be accepted and
have normal experiences such as High School.

At the same time as a crimewave is happening attributed to a menace known as Superfly (Ice Cube), who is gathering all kinds of high-end gear for his nefarious scheme.

When the brothers become aware of this while helping a human named April (Ago Edebiri), they become obsessed with her and desire to help her get to the bottom of the thefts and hope to win her approval as well as human acceptance in the process.

What follows is a madcap adventure with plenty of action and humor and
several celebrity voices which adds a new level of fun to the expanded
cast of supporting characters.

The animation style is at times a bit rough to watch over an extended
period but as the film progressed I became used to it and it did much like the two recent Spider-man animated films grow on me even if it can be distracting at times.

The cast is solid and the film seemed to play well to viewers of all ages
as there were jokes and references for all ages and the storyline was engaging even if it did at times seem to drag in places.

In the end the film is a loving and solid entry into the franchise and one that I am sure we will be seeing more animated entries from in the near future and is a must watch for fans of all ages.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,9.0,"One of the greatest surprises of the year has to be “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,” a film that I never would’ve expected to be as terrific as it is. Co-directed by Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears and co-written by Rowe, Seth Rogen, and Evan Goldberg, this animated feature is confident, action packed, funny, and is a visual delight. It’s a crowning achievement in animation, and the perfect summer movie to boot.

The film tells the origin story of four turtle brothers, Raphael (Brady Noon), Leonardo (Nicolas Cantu), Donatello (Micah Abbey), and Michelangelo (Shamon Brown Jr.), who were mutated after a dangerous laboratory explosion left them covered in radioactive ooze. Their adopted father Splinter (Jackie Chan), a kind and elderly New York City sewer rat, has sheltered his teenage sons from the harsh, dangerous, and judgmental human world for over a decade. Deciding that they want to be accepted as normal teenagers, the brothers head out into the city on their own, crossing paths with young reporter April O’Neil (Ayo Edebiri). A fast friendship develops, and the turtles find themselves taking on a mysterious crime syndicate that’s run by fellow mutants.

It’s a good story that’s elevated by across-the-board talent. Spears and Rowe’s crackerjack direction is on point, especially when it comes to orchestrating thrilling action scenes. This is easily one of the most well-directed animated features I’ve ever seen. Energetic and bursting with enthusiasm, it’s nearly impossible not to have a blast watching this movie.

The characters are great, too. The turtles may be mutants, but they still act like regular, dumb teenage boys, finding humor in the silliness of everyday experiences. The voice performances are outstanding too, with a talented cast and a diversity that feels natural and appropriate. Everyone (including Paul Rudd, Ice Cube, John Cena, Rose Byrne, and Giancarlo Esposito) gives top-tier turns, and it makes the movie even better.

It’s worth noting that this animated film isn’t made for little kids, and youngsters will likely be very bored and fidgety. This is more of a movie that’s geared towards ‘tweens, teens, and their parents (especially dads over 35 who grew up with the Ninja Turtles in various iterations). I would think longtime fans would be enamored with what the film does to their classic heroes, because a person like me who had very limited knowledge of the characters was quickly won over.

Films like “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” and “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” are exciting because not only are they breathing exciting life into the animation genre, they are setting the highest standards for quality, edgy animated films for adults. We should all hope for more projects of this caliber.",2023-08-04T07:05:18.216Z,614930,4 stars,0.49383580684661865

I was expecting little from this but it is actually quite an enjoyable action-packed animation. Some effort has been put into the script to enable some fun in the dialogue and for the characterisations to not just be sword-swinging would-be painters, but to have just the tiniest element of depth to them as the story develops.

""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is a whole lot of fun! It delivers everything TMNT fans wished for: entertaining turtle banter, badass ninja action - best sequence belongs to Jackie Chan's Splinter - and an awesome score.

The animation style inspired by purposely exaggerated sketches from director Jeff Rowe's teenage years - much like The Mitchells vs. the Machines and Into the Spider-Verse - perfectly fits the lighthearted atmosphere of the source material, and brings the famous turtles to the big screen in what is arguably the best film adaptation of the franchise.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Right, I am not the demographic and I ought to have hated this. Not least because it starts off with one of my lazy cinema writing bête noires - the ""King of England"". There is no such title or person! Anyway, pretty swiftly we find ourselves watching an overly contrived cake incident that must have trashed the expensive shag pile at Buckingham Palace. The visiting son of the US President - ""Alex"" (Taylor Zakhar Perez) gets involved in an altercation with Prince “Henry”, the grandson of the King. A week later he is despatched by his mother (Uma Thurman) on a diplomatic rescue mission ahead of her looming re-election battle and negotiations for a trade deal. What now ensues is way better than I was expecting. It's a simple enough bromance/rom-com but it uses adult language and some decent writing to illustrate a courtship that benefits from two actors who actually appear to gel on screen. It does no harm that Perez is very easy on the eye and is quite charismatic - though, surely just a bit too old for school - and both men offer an assured and confident performance that avoids the worst of the sentimental pitfalls - even if we do still get a polo match. As it builds I rather surprisingly found myself engaged with the story. Sure, it's light and fluffy, but somehow it's very normalisation of a gay relationship between two of the world's (theoretical) A-listers is actually quite warm and funny. The budget must have gone on private jets, luxury hotel suites and a couple of his and his powder blue hoodies - and that left the poor newsreader to do an entire Presidential election campaign wearing the same top! Perhaps it is meant to be some sort of play on the search for purpose by a real Prince, but that doesn't matter. Don't look for depth or realism (it has none) but if you are looking for something just a bit quirkier and entertaining then read the tin first, then you might get a surprise. I did.

Brent Marchant,3.0,"There are three things necessary to make a gay romantic comedy work: It needs to involve a readily recognizable gay relationship, it needs an undeniable sense of romance and it has to be funny. However, this heavily diluted, glacially paced piece of insipid celluloid fluff has none of the above, and it truly escapes me how many critics and viewers have found this utterly bland exercise to be heartwarming, charming and involving. In telling the somewhat far-fetched story of an alleged romance between a British prince and the son of an American president who start out as comically exaggerated adversaries but end up supposedly finding true love with one another, writer-director Matthew López subjects his audiences to an unconvincing relationship wholly lacking in chemistry and stemming from an improbable courtship, much of which arises from a string of all-too-convenient, less-than-discreet engagements that are otherwise supposedly impossible to arrange and coordinate. What’s more, the film’s humor is virtually nonexistent and incorporates none of the edginess generally associated with gay comedies. In fact, it’s so dull and so safe that it makes most Hallmark Channel movies seem downright risqué by comparison. To its credit, the picture makes some modestly eloquent statements about LGBTQ+ equality (even if they’re nothing we haven’t already heard many times before), and it features a fine supporting performance by Sarah Shahi as a smart-mouthed, fast-talking presidential aide (arguably the only genuinely funny element in the film), but it misses the mark on so many other fronts that it’s hard to believe this project ever got green-lighted. It’s a shame that the door opened by “Bros” (2022) to make gay romcoms a more viable cinematic genre has been set back by this underwhelming effort. It’s also equally disappointing that an organization like Amazon Studios – one known for generally doing solid work – could let something as sub-par as this out into the movie marketplace. Let’s hope moviegoers can put this one quickly behind them and see the foregoing issues soon fixed going forward.",2023-08-20T22:41:36.870Z,930094,2 stars,0.6273275017738342

CinemaSerf,6.0,"When a group of kids get together under the thumb of the rather odious ""Hayley"" (Zoe Terakes) they are presented with a ceramic hand - that apparently encases a real one - that acts as a portal to a dimension in which live the dead.

Following on from her best friend ""Jade"" (Alexandra Jensen) who has a go, it falls to ""Mia"" (Sophie Wilde) and after the most bizarre of personally traumatic connections, she is soon addicted to the experience and is also soon providing a conduit that is causing havoc within their group - not least for poor young ""Riley"" (Joe Bird) who ends up needing danger money - and a soft play area! Wilde does quite well here and though the rest of the acting isn't really up to much, the story has an originality to it that genuinely creates a new avenue for a genre that has been really suffering from same old, same old storytelling of late. Bird is by far the star here - even if he is incapacitated for much of it, and the aforementioned Terakes creates a character I'd cheerfully throttle.

garethmb,-1.0,"Welcome Foolish Mortals to the latest adaptation of the popular Disney attraction as Haunted Mansion has materialized for audiences to enjoy.

This time around the film follows a single mother named Gabbie (RosarioDawson), and her son Travis (Chase W. Dillon).

The family has moved into an abandoned mansion near New Orleans as they look to start over but find that their new abode is haunted.
Despite their best efforts to flee, the ghosts force them to return to the
mansion and they seek help in the form of a Priest named Father Kent (Owen Wilson), and Ben Matthias (LaKeith Stanfield) who has been reduced to doing Ghost Tours following a personal tragedy that saw his lofty skills and career vanish in the aftermath.

When the help finds themselves able to leave the mansion without an
otherworldly escort, they bring in a Medium named Harriet (Tiffany
Haddish) and in time the mysterious Madame Leota (Jamie Lee Curtis).
It is learned that a dangerous ghost is striking fear into the other 999
haunts that inhabit the locale and should he collect his 1000th soul, he
will unleash a new level of terror on the world.

Things become even more complicated with a local professor named Bruce (Danny DeVito) arrives and creates a new Wild Card to the situation.

The movie does a great job of capturing the look and tone of the
attraction as one of the great joys was seeing things ranging from the
pictures to stretching room and other factors big and small from the
attraction portrayed on the big screen.

The cast is great and works well with one another but the movie does take
some time getting ramped up and I did find it dragging in various places.
The audience laughed frequently but for me many of the jokes did not work which I attributed to the focus being on a a younger audience as I found them more amusing than funny.

The FX in the film are solid and Jared Leto’s character is so well done
you cannot recognize him as he has disappeared so deeply into the
character aided by some great visual work.

As a big fan of the attraction it was nice to see a much better take on
the source material than previous efforts.

In the end despite the flaws, there is enough happy nostalgia to keep fans
entertained and hopefully the audience will want to visit the mansion enough that a new franchise is on the way.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,6.0,"As a longtime Disney enthusiast, I was highly skeptical (and very wary) about director Justin Simien‘s “Haunted Mansion,” the second film inspired by the classic and beloved theme park attraction. Everything about this project screamed “pointless” and “dreadful,” but I was pleasantly surprised at the inventive and fun finished product.

When a woman (Rosario Dawson) and her bullied son (Chase Dillon) move to a haunted manor in New Orleans, they seek the help of supposed spiritual experts to help rid their historic home of supernatural inhabitants. They collect a motley crew of misfits, including a fake exorcist (Owen Wilson), a man with a penchant for photographing specters (LaKeith Stanfield), a history professor (Danny DeVito), and a medium (Tiffany Haddish). After it’s learned that once you enter the home you must always return (or a ghost will follow you home), everyone is trapped and cannot leave. After a walk on the other side during a séance, an evil spirit called the Hatbox Ghost (Jared Leto) is encountered, and he’s collecting souls. If the new friends want to live, they must work together before time runs out.

The mythology created fits in with the theme park ride, is done in a way that feels natural, and is sure to please Disney fans. Think of almost any element from the attraction and the film gives a satisfactory back story (Madame Leota’s is my favorite, not to mention the casting of Jamie Lee Curtis in the role). I can’t wait to go back to Disneyland after seeing this movie, because it will be so much fun to experience the Haunted Mansion through fresh eyes that have this new background narrative.

Easter eggs are around every corner, and they’re a fun treat for eagle-eyed viewers. Most elements from the attraction are incorporated organically (like the exterior and location-specific bits from both the Florida and California versions of the ride), and the most iconic scenes are fun to see on a grand scale (the stretching room, the dining room party, Constance in the attic). As a fan, I was absolutely delighted by all of this.

The film is elevated by a talented cast (including a strong lead performance from Stanfield and a charming one from Dillon) and kooky characters that lighten the mood when it gets too dark. There’s a lot of talk about grief, and plenty of borderline scares that may teeter on the terrifying side for little kids. This is not a traditional scary movie, and the balance of light humor and emotional drama works really well.

Since this is a big studio film, the overt product placement becomes distracting and laughable, and the denouement is bloated, excessive, and drawn out. The film could use a bit of editing, but I didn’t find it too long.

I quite enjoyed “Haunted Mansion,” flaws and all. If you’re a fan of the Disney parks and share a passion for the ride, I’m sure you will, too. It isn’t an instant classic by any means, but it’s far better than it has any right to be and is a fun way to spend a couple of hours this summer.",2023-08-04T07:00:12.977Z,616747,4 stars,0.6431393623352051
The Movie Mob,7.0,"**Haunted Mansion (2023) isn’t trying to bring some new franchise launching edge to the Disney ride’s story. Instead, it captures all the goofy pun-filled fun of the ride by allowing its excellent cast to have a blast!**

Haunted Mansion (2023) is a fun family adventure that gives each of its comedic talents their own time to shine and bring the laughs. My expectations were very low (especially after seeing the 2003 version). Still, I never should have bet against Owen Wilson’s lovable charm, but his endearing goofy antics were couched in a cast of characters that each had me laughing out loud. I struggle to choose a favorite character because they were all so ridiculously entertaining and delightful. But even amid all the wackiness, LaKeith Stanfield does excellent work delivering some genuinely moving and emotional moments. Many of the poor reviews on Haunted Mansion possibly expected something other than what it was: a fun family adventure full of clever quips, puns, and classic Disney charm. I felt a little nostalgic while enjoying the film and being impressed by its scarier moments. Haunted Mansion isn’t trying to be Pirates of the Caribbean.

The visual effects are pretty standard, it's bit over-scored and though much credited, I am not sure it mattered at all that Jared Leto was the Top-hat ghoul.

r96sk,5.0,"Simply, quite underwhelming is <em>'Haunted Mansion'</em>.

The original 2003 movie with Eddie Murphy is one I did enjoy just about, though it's been a long time since I watched it and I can only remember Murphy; no plot details or anything, so it's evidently quite a forgettable movie (or my memory isn't great, who's to say?).

This 2023 reboot holds similarities, in that sense. On paper, I like the cast so will likely remember them going forward. However, nothing else stands out in my thoughts... and I only finished viewing it moments ago, so that's not a positive sign. It holds a good cast list but it is disappointingly one that is wasted.

LaKeith Stanfield stands out most and puts in a solid showing, most notably in an unexpectedly emotive scene; which sadly didn't quite hit due to alternative reasons, nothing to do with Stanfield's fine acting. That scene, actually, also features the best joke, told by a certain Danny DeVito - who is kinda underutilized, really.

Rosario Dawson, Owen Wilson and Tiffany Haddish are alright in their respective roles, though Jamie Lee Curtis and Jared Leto are very meh in their parts; wouldn't have even known it was Leto to be honest, if not for the opening credits. Still, as you can tell by the names involved, it's a promising bunch with, in the end, unmined potential.

The story doesn't hold anything that I could find interesting, the visuals are boring and the scare attempts are easily predictable and of low quality. It is also a film that overruns, this ought to have been a 90 minute production (like the Murphy flick was) in my humble opinion.

Brent Marchant,9.0,"Telling the story of a larger-than-life individual truly calls for a larger-than-life film, and that’s precisely what writer-director Christopher Nolan has come up with in his latest feature outing, handily the best work of his career. Nolan’s three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and naïve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist’s life, chronicles his development of “the gadget” and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer’s odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture’s production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering’s outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. “Oppenheimer” is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder.",2023-07-24T12:59:23.547Z,872585,4 stars,0.5445630550384521
CinemaSerf,7.0,"Cillian Murphy offers an assured and considered performance here as the man who is credited with developing the bomb that hastened the end of WWII in the far east. He is the increasingly acclaimed, eponymous, physicist who is made aware by Admiral Lewis Strauss (another strong performance from Robert Downey Jr.) that it just possible that the Russians have the A-bomb. Now Oppenheimer already suspects that the Nazis are also well on their way to weaponising the atom - his earlier education and career had introduced him to some of the prominent minds in the UK and in Germany who were quite capable of taking the theory forward; so he begins to pressurise the American government to begin it's own programme - and the ""Manhattan Project"" is born. Motivated/goaded/galvanised by the ambitious ""Col. Groves"" (Matt Damon) he assembles a formidable collection of scientific minds at a purpose built, desert, location which he christens Los Alamos, and over the next three years - and with $2bn to spend - they work on the science whilst plutonium and uranium are being simultaneously processed at an irkingly glacial pace! Given that much of this is reasonably well documented history, the actual plot here has little by way of jeopardy. Instead, Christopher Nolan attempts via his writing and direction to put some meat on the bones of the characters here. It's clear that Oppenheimer is a bit of a Lothario, but it's also clear that he can engender the loyalty of a variety of people with diverging views - not just surrounding the science of their project, but around the morals and ethics of creating something that - well, you can't get the toothpaste back into the tube. The latter portion of this drama focusses on the subsequent, communist-obsessed, witch-hunting that went on attempting to persecute and smear this remarkable and flawed individual, and it makes some interesting postulations about just who was pulling whose strings. It also has quite a penetrating resonation about it - not just, specifically, about Oppeneheimer - but about all of those post-event ""enquiries"" that rarely deliver an honest appraisal of what was done in the name of expediency at the time, but ends up more of a character assassination exercise by those who didn't do anything against those who did and had to. Though at times the pace of this thing helps to keep it enthralling, it is too long - at times it really does plod along. Perhaps an other, objective, eye on the writing/direction may have tightened it up without having to sacrifice any of the potency of the story. Maybe someone needs to tell Mr. Nolan that a three hour film isn't always required! That said, it's a gorgeous film to look at. The aesthetics are first rate and the entire sentiment of the film reeks of authenticity. I do think this thrives better on a big screen so try to see it as it was intended. It's though provoking, complex, characterful - and well worth a watch.",2023-07-26T10:19:45.348Z,872585,4 stars,0.5197722911834717

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,8.0,"The intersection of innovation, science, political bureaucracy, and ethics meet in writer-director Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer,” a dark, challenging biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. This profound epic clocks in at three hours yet never feels too long, even if it’s painfully clear that Nolan is indulging himself in a passion project.

During World War II, Lt. General Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) appoints physicist Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Assembling a team of the brightest scientists the country has to offer, the experts spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. When their final product is used against Japan on July 16, 1945, the world witnesses its first nuclear explosion in an event that not only ends the war, but forever changes the course of history.

There has been much hype about the fact that Nolan chose to film in IMAX, but the large format feels wasted here. The visuals are far from stunning, and the film is mostly a dramatic, dialogue-heavy history lesson that’s a far cry from what I’d call “entertaining.” It’s a great movie that’s engaging, sophisticated, and intelligent, but those expecting traditional thrills are going to be greatly disappointed. Save your money, because seeing this in IMAX isn’t really worth it.

Nolan’s film is poignant in a way that’s chillingly relevant. His story not only explores one of the most important figures in U.S. history, but also makes you think about the current lack of empathy that’s plaguing society. There’s a very real moral question about humanity’s ability to make something that will help save the lives of many but also result in the death of innocents, and Nolan makes a strong political statement in a surprisingly restrained manner. His commentary on the far-reaching effects of such a powerful weapon born from the intersection of innovation, science, and government, while being an invention that has changed but also endangered the world, will give you chills. Nolan’s script is terrific, and is one of my favorite screenplays of the year.

Nolan tells much more of the obscure back story of Oppenheimer’s professional and personal life that few know, and it makes for a lengthy (but interesting) narrative. The film includes his ties to the Communist Party, Hoover’s FBI investigation, his tangles with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), and an eventual closed-door hearing that was designed to strip him of his security clearance years after the war ended.

“Oppenheimer” is a complex film that requires your full attention, with myriad characters and time jumps that will keep you on your toes. A basic knowledge of history is beneficial, but those who have only heard the name Robert Oppenheimer and are aware of the very basics (like the fact that he was involved in the creation of the atomic bomb) won’t be completely lost.

In addition to complicated discussions of quantum physics, there are weighty themes about the dangers of government bureaucracy and the moral and ethical implications of creating a weapon of mass destruction. Nolan isn’t the type of storyteller who is keen on hand holding, and it’s refreshing to see a riveting movie that’s made for thinking audiences.",2023-08-04T07:04:22.910Z,872585,4 stars,0.33444744348526
Thulan Perera,9.0,"The cinematic masterpiece that is Oppenheimer leaves an indelible impression on anyone who watches it. Christopher Nolan has truly outdone himself with this film, delivering a poignant message about the horrors of nuclear war. The superb direction and exceptional performances by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and others draw you into the story, making you feel as though you are right there in the midst of it all. Even though there aren't any action scenes, the movie still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat for its entire 3-hour runtime. Oppenheimer is a biopic that everyone knows the ending to, but thanks to the expert direction and awe-inspiring performances, it is an experience that will leave a lasting impression on you.",2023-10-02T15:14:08.230Z,872585,4 stars,0.47745975852012634
Sarthak Bharad,10.0,"> **Oppenheimer:** I feel like I have blood on my hands, sir.
> 
> **Truman:** [takes a handkerchief from his pocket and gives it to him] You think anyone in Hiroshima or Nagasaki gives a shit about who built the bomb?

an incredibly well-written and extremely well-acted piece of dramatic cinema about the very eventful and complicated life of J. Robert Oppenheimer and it is beautiful. I'm actually surprised this is a huge summer blockbuster.

anytime Christopher Nolan releases a film, it's obviously an event all around the world because he's made tons of great films and he's one of the very few film-makers working today who really cares about cinema and values that cinematic experience. he's also one of the very few people who's actually given a budget to support his love for cinema. he shoots on film, does everything practically, he wants as little CGI as possible and he has apparently claimed that there isn't a single CGI shot in this film. if that's actually the case, like if he hasn't even included cleanup shots in the film, then my spirit just left my body. it's astounding.

went into this film with very limited knowledge about the life of Oppenheimer. like most people, I only knew him as The Father of the Atomic Bomb and the famous lines he quoted from the Bhagavad Gita which are Now I Am Become Death, The Destroyer of Worlds where he's talking about the atomic bomb realising the gravity of his creation and having to live with the sin of his achievement. I had no other knowledge about him as a person, his life outside of the invention, and the events that followed before or after it. so, if you're going into this film expecting an explosion porn, you're most likely to get disappointed having to sit through 3 hours' worth of heavy dramatic dialogue involving moments of genuinely terrifying character development. the film is about the person whose most pivotal moment in life was the success of The Manhattan Project. getting to experience being inside that person's mind as he's trying to visualize all these things combined with an incredible score by Ludwig Göransson and watching all of these rated-R, 3-hour, dialogue-heavy, beautifully shot on film by the master himself Hoyte van Hoytema with black and white sequences in a fucking theatre made me feel like I wasn't in 2023.

the performances are excellent. there really is no other word for it. from the top all the way down to the bottom of the incredibly huge cast list, there isn't a single weak link. Robert Downey Jr. is simply terrific. I haven't seen him like this since Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which came all the way back in 2005. I love him as Iron Man but that's more about the character rather than him as an actor. I wouldn't be shocked if he's nominated for a best supporting actor performance. Emily Blunt is also just really really great. there is a sequence early on in the film where Oppenheimer is being questioned and she's just sitting back there in the scene, out of focus. we're not even shown a close-up of her during this entire sequence until it becomes relevant later on in the film and we go back to that sequence when we finally realise the significance of her being there. Nolan has done quite a lot of that in this film actually. major A-list actors are in the film for like 2 scenes and then they never appear again. that's not just a testament to the actors who'd give anything to be in a Nolan-directed film but a testament to Nolan himself, as a film-maker. if we go back to the same sequence I mentioned earlier with Blunt, that's not just anyone sitting there, it's Emily Blunt. a phenomenal actress. but that's what gives the film a sense of groundedness. that the people on-screen are actual people, they behave like people. and for a certain amount of time, allows those celebrities to feel like normal people. Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Jason Clarke, Dane DeHaan, I can go on and on but literally everyone is fucking phenomenal. the real star of the show though, is Cillian Murphy. in his first lead role for a Nolan film after having worked with him for almost 20 years, Murphy shines brighter than the atomic bomb itself and walks with suave leaving not just two, but a multitude of shockwaves. his work is beyond phenomenal here. he not only looks like Oppenheimer but every scene he's in, he's just instantly captivating. it's not just his incredible eyes (which go so deep that I just wanna sink myself in them) but, he's just always in character. never did I once see the guy from Red Eye or from Peaky Blinders. it was always Oppie.

I'm actually putting this review as I listen to the absolutely bonkers score that has been provided for the film. Göransson's work is truly, awesome-tacularly, riveting. my heart was beating so fast in some sequences that have this heavy, beating sounds that I could almost have a seizure. the work here is truly remarkable.

another aspect of this film that shines brighter than ever is its editing. this is a 3-hour film that feels like 2 and a half. a half-an-hour of time just evaporated for me. every scene ends perfectly. there is no room for baggage. several big moments of history fly away in an instant. this gives the film a really focused feel. it gives the audience a cue that this is not the story of the world but it is the story of Oppenheimer. Nolan really knows how to edit his films such that they have just the right runtime and I really appreciate when a film-maker does that. it very much also gives this film that documentary-esque aspect and gets you convinced that these events actually did happen and this is not just some made-up story about a man's life.

this film is truly a marvelous achievement not just for Christopher Nolan himself as a filmmaker but for cinema as a whole. peak dramatic cinema. watch this on the biggest screen possible and the loudest speakers you can find.",2023-10-16T09:16:57.596Z,872585,5 stars,0.45341548323631287

I will only say that I thought it a really good movie: smartly written and nicely acted. I had some trouble following details in places — not because of the complex time structure (though I admit prefer the straight ahead story style of, say, The Godfather) but rather because I couldn’t get volume up loud enough to hear when the characters spoke softly and/or quickly, and without captions I had to wait for the context of conversations to help fill in what I was missing.

TheRealMina,2.0,"The movie is incredibly overrated and filled with unnecessary dramatized scenes, making it excessively long. It presents Oppenheimer as a cliche, portraying him as the world's smartest man who can learn a language in six weeks, accompanied by aggressively written advanced equations on a blackboard with a loud soundtrack.

In my opinion, this film stands as Nolan's second worst movie, following Tenet. It embodies all his negative qualities, and its duration should not have exceeded 1 hour and 40 minutes, stretching unnecessarily to 3 hours.",2023-11-19T23:17:25.927Z,872585,1 star,0.6480545401573181
misubisu,1.0,"The most inefficient telling of a story that I have ever experienced. Hugely unnecessary character development and unnecessary dramatisation.

I only made it to halfway before dyeing of boredom... jumped forward a chunk... saw the president say that the Russians would never succeed in obtaining the atomic bomb (unsure as to what he based this on). The movie was a strong testament to how much the US feared penetration by communism... and the fact that the US fear themselves losing their grip on being 'the leaders of the free world' [a title that they have never deserved or earned]... and the fact that no one has learned anything from history and being in perpetual war.

Truly a missed opportunity to tell this story in a way that would have any memorable meaning.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,5.0,"I was actually looking forward to watch this movie. Unfortunately I have to say I was rather disappointed when the movie came to an end.

One of the most impressive projects ever undertaken filled with scientifical challenges and performed under immense pressure.

That is what the movie should have been all about. Unfortunately it is not. Instead all the science, challenges and achievements are just glossed over and we are feed three long, boring, hours about political machinations and his sex life.

That is not what I was expecting and it is definitely not what I wanted to watch.

Trust Hollywood to turn science into a bloody soap-like drama.

Christopher Nolan is definitely not a person that should be tasked with making a science or history movie. His Dunkirk was underwhelming to say the least and Interstellar was both a poor movie and a joke when it came to science.

Amiiae011,10.0,"**Oppenheimer may not be for many people, but it was wonderful for me.** This movie does require some knowledge and interest in science, but it doesn't mean that you have to be an expert. I surely recommend doing some research before and after watching the film to better understand it. I also recommend researching about the simple facts of the Manhattan Project, who the people involved in the Manhattan Project are, and who Oppenheimer is before and after watching the movie.

**WATCH IT ON THE BIGGEST IMAX SCREEN YOU CAN FIND, especially if you are interested in science, the true story of the Manhattan Project, and course, other Chris Nolan films. This movie was filmed specially for IMAX screening, Nolan and his crew used IMAX 70mm film and cameras, and they also invented the B&W 65mm film specially for this movie.**

I have watched every single Chris Nolan’s films ever since I was a kid. His movies have been a big part of my life and his movies are the things that helped me go through tough times and give me a new dream. Oppenheimer was just staggering. It was amazing, I do not have the words to describe my feelings watching that movie, especially seeing how much improvements Cillian, Nolan and other actors have gotten through over the years, and I was so glad that Cillian is finally getting the attention he deserves too. The cinematography, the storyline, the dialogues, the characters, the music, the camera angles, position, lighting, editing, the script, and everything else were just amazing. I have read every single line of the transcript and I have already rewatched the movie 5 times to better understand it. I also am reading the American Prometheus which is amazing. After my first time watching Oppenheimer, the thoughts and questions I had after watching it stayed with me for weeks, which led me to watch it again and again. I was amazed, it was breathtaking. The cinematography was beautiful and it couldn’t have been better. The fact that Nolan didn’t use CGI for the Trinity test scene and Oppenheimer's visions of the quantum world just made me more inspired. Five stars are not enough for this movie, neither are any stars and ratings in this world. This movie is out of this world and it is a masterpiece.


The costumes in this movie were simply amazing. The costumes were very well designed, and the colours were also amazing. It also played a huge part in the movie and helped Nolan out a lot by just contributing to making his visuals and imagination come to life. 

The sound effect was unbelievable. The sound effects + Cinematography and Visual Effects made me feel like I was in the room with all the characters when all the events occurred. The Trinity test scene was also amazing, I loved how Nolan expressed the nervousness of the scientists before and after pressing the button. 
I also absolutely loved the soundtrack of this film. Ludwig Goransson used a variety of instruments and tempos to convey the mood of the scene and the emotions of a character. The soundtrack enhances the film scenes and makes the whole film much more interesting to watch. Nothing in this world, no headphones, earphones, and speakers can be used to replicate my feelings listening to these soundtracks in an IMAX theatre.
The casting was amazing too. The actors were excellent in portraying the difficult emotions of their characters. Cillian Murphy was amazing at representing the emotion Oppenheimer felt during his hardships over the years. The supporting actors and actresses were also amazing at playing the supporting parts in this movie and acting out how their characters had an impact on Oppenheimer's life. 

If you have already watched the film and found it very fun and interesting, and if you want to learn more about how the film was made, I highly recommend you watch videos online regarding Christopher Nolan's method of making this film. I also recommend you watch interviews and the bts of this film as you may learn more amazing things about the movie and Nolan's way of filmmaking. If you want to learn more about the Manhattan Project and especially Oppenheimer's life, I highly recommend you read The American Prometheus as it is the book that Chris Nolan took the inspiration and information for this film. Although it is quite long, it is worth it. I also recommend you read the transcript of this film if you have time, as you can understand the dialogues and words better and check the parts and details you may have missed in the movie. The script is written in first person POV: Oppenheimer's viewpoint, which makes it more interesting to read, and it makes you feel like you are in the same room as the characters, even without visual effects.

I was amazed at the fact that Christopher Nolan did not use CGI for this movie. Almost everything was practical and CGI was only used to enhance the look. Nolan has already amazed the cinema society with his simply staggering practical effects that were huge and well-planned. Nolan used all sorts of creative ways to recreate the iconic Trinity Test scene and the unique visions of Oppenheimer. By watching the bts of Oppenheimer, you can see how determined Nolan is to bring a masterpiece to the table.
 
Some people may find this movie boring. If you hate movies based on history, have zero interest in science, or hate movies that require a bit of thinking and researching before and after, then probably this movie may not be for you and you might find the movie extremely _boring._ Of course, you should understand that everyone has different opinions and views about almost anything in this world so there is always a possibility that you may disagree with the things I have said here.
**Overall, this movie is a masterpiece**. As a fan of Noaln's films and Cillian Murphy's acting ever since childhood, this film couldn't have been better. I definitely recommend you see this, as soon as possible, and on the biggest IMAX screen possible because it would be worth it. Of course, if you dislike the kinds of films I mentioned in the previous paragraphs, I don't recommend you see this film. I want to thank the crew who have worked very hard on this project, I want to thank the actors who just showed a staggering performance, I want to thank Ludwig Goransson for his amazing soundtracks in this film, and of course, I want to thank Christopher Nolan for his dedication and his amazing film, I would like to call **his masterpiece**.",2023-12-29T14:13:26.952Z,872585,5 stars,0.4886992573738098

r96sk,9.0,"Yep, a quality film.

<em>'Oppenheimer'</em> lived up to the billing to me. Not that that was ever really in any doubt, with Christopher Nolan at the helm and Cillian Murphy in lead alongside all the acclaim that I have seen this receive since its 2023 release. The near 3hr run time is no problem whatsoever, despite more talk than anything else the film simply doesn't hold any slow/uninteresting moments - 'tis all fascinating.

Ever since I found out about his casting I knew Murphy would deliver a sensational performance and that's exactly what he produces here, which is not even a tiny bit surprising - anyone who has seen television's <em>'<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)"" rel=""nofollow"">Peaky Blinders</a>'</em>, for one, would know that. Loved every single second of him onscreen.

As for the rest of the cast, where do you start?! Emily Blunt is impressive, again not a shock as I'm a fan of her from other things - shoutout <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/the-adjustment-bureau/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Adjustment Bureau</a>'</em>. Matt Damon stars alongside Blunt in that aforementioned great flick, he himself is very good in this. Robert Downey Jr. shows quality too. All others have much less screentime but do a fair bit with it, for example Jason Clarke and Florence Pugh.

It was impossible not to be fully engrossed in this, at least for me. It is not my favourite Nolan movie, <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/inception/"" rel=""nofollow"">Inception</a>'</em> and <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/interstellar/"" rel=""nofollow"">Interstellar</a>'</em> surpass but to be honest it's the definition of splitting hairs as his films are of such a high standard. For example, <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/dunkirk-2017/"" rel=""nofollow"">Dunkirk</a>'</em> and <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/tenet/"" rel=""nofollow"">Tenet</a>'</em> move me less but are still ones I rate highly.

Oppenheimer was a brilliant scientist indeed but he was also a COMMUNIST (there is a ton of evidence/articles about it and he even admitted liking communist ideas and social values, was a member of communist fronts, subscriber to communist magazines, sent them money monthly, his brother, wife, mistress and believe it or not many of his students were also known communists).

He was indeed a security risk and some may go further to say that he committed an act of treason but the film presented a false image of Oppenheimer as the ""mistreated scientist"" who had to endure great injustice for the higher cause of stopping a nuclear arms race.",2024-03-12T22:27:20.334Z,872585,2 stars,0.385147362947464

First of all, there's this stupid annoying background music all the time during the movie, which is very distracting. Now add to this background music actors that talk almost like whispering. It's just horrible, but what's worst about this movie is that it is super boring and uninteresting and it's very long (3 hours).

Murp,10.0,"[MINOR SPOILERS, but nothing major]
This film was unlike any I have ever seen. Let me be clear, it is certainly not for everyone. The daunting 3-hour runtime can steer some away, which I completely understand, but you have the time and patience, give it a chance.

A large portion of the film is consumed by dialogue, yet never once did I get bored. I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time (it helped that I wasn’t well-versed in the history of Robert Oppenheimer as a person, although I knew the gist of his story).   The non-linear plot format also helped to keep my attention as we see blips of Oppenheimer’s life as a student, working on the Manhattan Project, and the scrutiny he faced afterward. This take on the presentation of his story could’ve easily backfired and been executed poorly. However, director Christopher Nolan constructed it in a way that was both interesting and easy to follow.

Cillian Murphy delivered a convincing portrayal and Oppenheimer’s emotional journey is shown beautifully through his performance. Robert Downey Jr. does just as good of a job, as he portrays Lewis Strauss as he grapples with his complicated relationship with Oppenheimer. Acting-wise, Murphy and Downey were the highlights, but Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Florence Pugh all played their parts well. 

Acting aside, the music score further enhanced my viewing experience. As a musician, music is something I always pay attention to in films. Ludwig Göransson brilliantly composed a soundtrack to represent that whirlwind of thoughts and emotions conveyed by Oppenheimer’s life. I had already been exposed to some of his work prior to this, so when I saw he was composing for this movie, it piqued my interest. _Can You Hear the Music_ was not only one of my favorite parts of the music, but of the film as a whole. The chaotic, yet beautiful string runs that gradually increase in speed along with the subtle yet alarming horns in the background give off a complicated feeling of dread, anxiety, and contemplation.

I saw this for the first time in theaters, a second time at home, and then again in theaters a couple months ago in March when it was briefly reissued.

Although you may not like it as much as me (this review is definitely a bit biased), I strongly urge you to give it a watch.",2024-05-29T20:19:51.407Z,872585,3 stars,0.4710201025009155

IbraheemZia,-1.0,"Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is more than just a historical biopic — it’s a deep, haunting exploration of conflict, ambition, and the moral consequences of human progress. The film draws you in with its dense and compelling narrative, and its impact lingers long after the credits roll.

What Works Well:

Exceptional Performances: Cillian Murphy delivers an unforgettable portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer, capturing both brilliance and torment. Supporting actors like Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt bring emotional weight and complexity to their roles.

Storytelling & Structure: Nolan masterfully weaves through different timelines and perspectives, showing not just the creation of the atomic bomb, but the internal and external pressures shaping that era. It doesn’t feel overly fragmented — each scene builds tension and meaning.

Visual & Sound Design: The cinematography (shot by Hoyte van Hoytema) and Ludwig Göransson’s score work together beautifully, making even quieter scenes feel ominous and intense. The build-up to the climactic moments is breathtaking and horrifying in equal measure.

Ethical Depth: The film doesn’t shy away from the darker implications of scientific and military advancement. It forces viewers to consider: at what cost do we push boundaries?

Some Drawbacks:

Length & Pacing: At around three hours, Oppenheimer demands attention. For casual viewers, some stretches may feel slow, especially in the buildup to the major turning points.

Complex Themes: Audiences without background knowledge in physics, history, or Cold War politics may find certain segments heavy or slightly confusing. However, Nolan balances this well by focusing on character and emotion.",2025-10-07T08:20:45.866Z,872585,4 stars,0.7385611534118652
MovieGuys,6.0,"Cobweb taps into well worn horror concepts and delivers something a little different but hardly surprising.

We all know from the get go, what Cobweb represents in broad terms. A tale of a child, locked away by its parents, because its different and more than a little, sinister.

Stepping beyond the predictable, is a few tweaks that set this horror film apart. Mostly, in a good way. Cleverly re-working aspects of a classic premise, pays dividends in terms of scares and a surprising reveal.

What doesn't work so well, is the family dynamic. We all knows its dysfunctional. The fact its so coldly, over stated, feels oppressive. Injecting a little more genuine warmth, into the family's interactions, would have heightened the impact, of the horror, that inevitably unfolds. 

Acting is decent, especially given the young age of some cast members. 

Only thing I'm not so sure about is why the voice over for the sister character, ends up sounding like Marge Simpsons, spinster sisters? 

In summary, enough that's new, grafted onto a well established horror premise, to make this film a success. Somewhat let down, by heavy handling, surrounding the family dynamic.",2023-08-14T04:47:59.140Z,709631,3 stars,0.6209248304367065
CinemaSerf,6.0,"Woody Norman is quite good in this otherwise rather routine horror movie. He is only eight years old when he suddenly starts hearing noises coming from the walls of their old wooden house. His parents initially try to assuage his concerns but when his well-meaning teacher ""Miss Divine"" (Cleopatra Coleman) shows them a drawing he made at school, the atmosphere at home becomes distinctly frosty. When the knocking noises become a girl's voice - and this voice starts to encourage him to stand up for himself a bit more, we soon realise that nothing in this house is as he thought. There are secrets galore! The last twenty minutes are certainly the highlight, but original they are not. We have seen the use of these effects all too frequently and though just deserts were handed out enjoyably for a few moments, there just wasn't much by way of jeopardy and the only screaming I heard was of the word sequel. It is difficult to reinvent the wheel; being innovative with this genre is tough.

The war of Kens during the last half hour of the film is an all-timer because a battle full of handsome maneuvers, like showing off their naked chest and manly noogies, turns into a full on dance off between Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu.

But the second half of the film leaves a thought-provoking message in your brain regarding both men and women. The Kens gaining respect little by little mirrors how women eventually earned their rights to be respected individuals — after being considered as only being useful in the kitchen or for making babies — except with the gender roles reversed and nude blobs instead of genitalia.

Manuel São Bento,8.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.firstshowing.net/2023/review-greta-gerwigs-barbie-is-both-hilarious-thought-provoking/

""Barbie is hilariously meta, containing spectacularly funny musical numbers, and an efficient tonal balance between over-the-top comedy and rich, thought-provoking social commentary. Inevitable awards are on the way for the brightly colored production design, costumes, and makeup.

Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach's narrative unapologetically tackles quite serious topics, from sociopolitical matters like patriarchy and sexual harassment to questions about existential crises, personal identity, self-love, and, of course, the roles of women and men in today's society.

Margot Robbie was destined to play Barbie just as Ryan Gosling was born with Kenergy in his veins. Absolutely fantastic, as are the rest of the Barbies and Kens.

A must-see in a packed theater!""

CinemaSerf,7.0,"""Thus Spake Zarabarbie"" - that's the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it's origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it's current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit. Well, that's the philosophy in Margot Robbie's ""Barbieland"". A sterile sort of environment that lives it's life along the lines of a pink ""Groundhog Day"". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned ""Ken"" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a ""Barbie"". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical ""Barbie"" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See ""Weird Barbie"" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn't like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted ""Ken"" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by ""Sasha"" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Ferrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged ""Ken"" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don't have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend ""Sasha"", her much less cyclical mother ""Gloria"" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world's are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman's perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever ""Carla"" from ""Cheers!"") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole ""Barbie"" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end. Don't be a snob about this, get yourself into a cinema and prepare to be entertained. Bergman it isn't, but an enjoyable evaluation and parody of 21st century life, opportunity and all things vacuous it certainly is.",2023-07-26T09:14:30.960Z,346698,3 stars,0.41017621755599976
JP Hastings-Spital,8.0,"This was an _excellent_ film that left me emotionally stretched in just the right way. It's an adult movie with childhood references (not a kids' film at all), and seems pitched at people roughly my age (Matchbox 20 referenced as a track for wooing is too close for comfort!) It _superbly_ voices the internal contradictions women need to navigate to be accepted. It works hard not to centre Ken, even while his role is a critical counterpoint, but also gives a little airtime to how much a male-dominated world makes it hard to be a man too.

The writing is out of this world, the pacing is spot on, and Margot Robbie utterly _nails_ the role — especially the emotional and physical aspects of being a doll in a way that playfully nods to the many ways that children play with Barbie.

It's a wonderful film that I'd encourage everyone to see. It's _hard_ to watch, as a man—feeling responsible for so many challenges women face—but Barbie doesn't judge, it voices. It's a message that informs me, helps me, as well as entertaining me, but it isn't meant for _me_; the extent to which Yvette felt seen, understood and perfectly spoken on behalf of _is_ this movie, and why it deserves all the praise it's getting.

Brent Marchant,5.0,"“Heavy is the arm that wears its heart on its sleeve.” That’s the best way to sum up this overwritten, overlong, stunningly obvious treatise on gender equality, consumerism and existentialism, whose messages get beaten to death beginning early on and never let up, an exhausting experience, to be sure. Writer-director Greta Gerwig’s latest offering, co-written with collaborator Noah Baumbach, features a dreadful script that’s about as subtle as a young adult novel, drones on and on and on for about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be, becomes endlessly repetitive, and incorporates story threads that could have easily been scaled back or eliminated entirely (such as those with Will Ferrell and Michael Cera). What’s more, much of the dialogue is either stupefyingly juvenile or sounds more like “writing” than anything anyone would actually say (even for a fictional fantasy character), with attempts at humor that often fall woefully flat. And, to be honest, for all intents and purposes, the project comes across like a two-hour commercial for Mattel (even if the company manages to find ways to poke fun at itself). To its credit, “Barbie” does have a few strengths going for it, such as its superb production design, some genuinely clever humor (especially its opening pre-titles sequence and occasional asides), and fine performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (who manage to make this material look better than it actually is), as well as a heartwarming appearance by Rhea Perlman. Beyond that, though, this is handily the most overrated, overhyped release of the summer movie season, one that I’ll easily forget before year’s end – and one that conclusively proves the power of marketing, no matter what the quality of the merchandise being promoted.",2023-07-30T00:45:37.364Z,346698,2 stars,0.5401660203933716

DRDMovieMusings,7.0,"The _Barbie_ movie is funny, and fun, and moved with deft pace from laughs to moments so engaging you could hear a pin drop in the theatre.

Its social message should not be controversial — _Barbie_ is a _critique of power and status quo_. 

Its allegory in art swings at every in-power group, and gives voice to every marginalized group.

There's even a point at which Barbie longs to restore the status quo in Barbieland and return to her position of privilege, and is chastised by Ken who, having reversed the roles, asks her ""how does it feel?"" (to be not seen, to not matter).

_Barbie_ illustrated clearly that _the status quo hurts everyone, including those in power_ — in other words, challenging the status quo is good for men as well as woman (and insert every other power dynamic here  — able-bodied as well as mobility-challenged, rich as well as poor, etc.)

That its social message is controversial proves its necessity. The only way this critique on power and status quo could be misconstrued as an attack on men is if people think power and control of the status quo belong only to men — which, eureka! is precisely what this movie is speaking to.

The Movie Mob,7.0,"**Barbie's breathtaking visuals and practical effects outshine the erratic storytelling to make a fresh and innovative movie with themes that will be divisive for many.**

Barbie is a visually stunning achievement that has excelled at the box office while dividing audiences. On the one hand, Barbie amazes with extravagant practical sets and exceptional performances, but on the other hand, the story and directing feel chaotic and erratic. The target audience seems to be moms who played with Barbies and would bring their daughters to the film. Therefore, some film's themes feel more grown up than expected for a movie about a child's toy. Despite probably not being the primary target demographic, I enjoyed the film, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's performance. They elevated the story and script to the successful giant the movie has become. The casting of Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell was perfect for the roles they portrayed. The sets and production design were some of the most impressive I have ever seen in a film! The story was unfocused and unpredictable but also fun and lighthearted. While I wouldn't say Barbie was perfect, and its themes a little too complex for a movie about a toy, its production design and unique story stood out in an era of remakes and sequels.",2023-09-09T03:43:42.829Z,346698,3 stars,0.5096539258956909

threestardave,-1.0,"First off, let me say that the production aspects of Greta Gerwig's Barbie are ... incredible. It is a beautiful movie and an incredible homage to its subject matter and its selected era aesthetic.

I'm always a bit leery about saying something is brilliant, or even profound, but I will say that Barbie is simultaneously entertaining, nostalgic, hilarious, moving, inspirational, and thought-provoking, and I look forward to re-watching it a number of times in the future.

r96sk,7.0,"<em>'Barbie'</em> has more to it than I would've predicted. It's a good movie.

I steer clear of as much film promo as possible, so was kinda expecting this to be more of a 'proper' comedy - just an assumption on my part. It does have humour but it's far from the film's main thing, there are a few chucklesome moments but I found it to be more earnest than funny.

It does get a tiny bit moralistic, though undoubtedly has the right intentions and does certainly hit the nail on the head with certain points. The story itself is interesting, I like that they didn't lean deep into the usual fish out of water stuff when Barbie visits the real world. I enjoy how the world is set, with the multiple Barbies and Kens etc.

The cast are great. Margot Robbie is top notch - the perfect choice. Ryan Gosling is excellent as well, while America Ferrera, Will Ferrell and Michael Cera are positives too.

ikeker,-1.0,"[Blu-ray HD Movies Store](https://www.bluray-discs.com)

My feelings were somewhat ambivalent before watching ""Barbie"". Due to my admiration for Greta Gerwig's films and her personal work, I had high expectations. However, the comprehensive marketing of ""Barbie"" had me concerned that it might fall into the trap of consumerist pseudo-feminism and face backlash from the public.


But I must say, this film truly exceeded my expectations!

Perhaps many people watched ""Barbie"" for the nostalgia of their childhood, but this movie is not about creating a pure and nostalgic atmosphere like ""Toy Story"". It is a profound and highly modern film with a thought-provoking core, marking a breakthrough for Hollywood in commercial films with feminist themes. Its narrative remains closely linked to various issues in modern society. While it includes the passionate declarations and satirical commentary on patriarchy often seen in feminist films, it also sincerely attempts to build bridges for dialogue between genders and among the same gender.


This is particularly evident in its depiction of ""patriarchy"" and the ""male gaze.""

**What is patriarchy?**


The answer presented by the film is that patriarchy does not necessarily refer to a society solely ruled by men. The essence of patriarchy lies in the imbalance of power structures, thus any society where one party dominates or suppresses the discourse of another is an embodiment of patriarchy. The film conveys this through the contrasting portrayal of Barbieland, which represents a matriarchal society, and Kendom, which represents a patriarchal society, as well as the power struggles between the two and their resulting consequences. In Barbieland, the Barbies have absolute dominance in social, political, economic, and cultural aspects. The night festivities always belong to the Barbies, while Kens merely serve as props. On the other hand, Ken, after experiencing the baptism of the real world (the true patriarchy society), immediately becomes more patriarchal and transforms Barbieland into Kendom, adopting the patriarchal system of the real world. The power dynamics are thus reversed, and the Barbies become mere servants to the Kens. However, whether it is Ken in Barbieland or Barbie in Kendom, both are unable to express themselves freely. They both inevitably become objectified beings, seeking their own worth through the validation of others. This is because the web of power restricts subjectivity and is independent of gender. Anyone, regardless of gender, can be the perpetrator of patriarchy, and anyone, regardless of gender, can be a victim of patriarchy. This exploration sets the film apart from many mainstream movies that fail to delve into the complexities of patriarchy.


That being said, the climactic scene where the Barbies reclaim political power seems to suggest that female governance is stronger than solely male governance, but with the need for certain modifications. However, upon watching it only once, I am not entirely certain about this point.

**Reproduction of the Four Gazes of Gender**


It can be said that the film industry has always been built upon the male gaze, while the female gaze has gradually become familiar with the progress of society and the increasing influence of women in consumer culture. However, the male gaze often found in films is directed towards sexualized female characters, especially evident in the visual language. Similarly, the female gaze is based on the objectification of male characters from the perspective of female viewers. In contrast, the discussion of male gaze towards other males or female gaze towards other females, and the impacts they generate, are rarely brought up in public discourse.


These four dimensions of gender gaze are represented to varying degrees in the film ""Barbie"". In Barbieland, the Kens are the objects of gaze and are in a passive position both physically and mentally. After experiencing the privileges brought by patriarchy for males in the real world, Ken projects his inner desires and fantasies onto successful male figures in reality, ultimately achieving self-identification with these masculine qualities by establishing Kendom. The Barbies in Kendom, including Barbie herself portrayed by Robbie, and the peculiar gaze directed towards them when they enter the real world, represent the reproduction of the male gaze. The Barbies in Barbieland may appear carefree and glamorous, but they still hold certain underlying consensus regarding ""beauty"". That is why Barbie becomes so alarmed when she discovers that her feet are no longer in the shape of high heels but can fully touch the ground, or when her skin develops cellulitis instead of remaining smooth. This also explains why the unconventional and eccentric Barbie advocating female liberation and freedom is initially excluded from the mainstream in Barbieland, only to be eventually accepted at the end.

**Non-stereotypical Feminism in Barbie**


The third highlight of this film lies in its unconventional expression of feminism, primarily manifested through the construction and subsequent shattering of Barbieland, which breaks away from the clichés of commercial films representing female themes, such as those centered around young girls.


Postfeminism emerged in the 1980s as a critique and reflection on the waves of the second-wave feminist movement. It is not a singular school of thought, but rather encompasses a broad concept containing various voices. According to feminist scholar Angela McRobbie, postfeminism overly emphasizes individual choices, which hinders the understanding of gender's structural role and impact, thereby weakening the force of social change. Furthermore, in the context of the ""sheconomy,"" postfeminism's endorsement of consumerism also poses the danger of reducing feminism to a commodity or marketing strategy. This, in turn, obstructs people from acknowledging the real challenges faced by women in economic, political, and social spheres. From this perspective, the film's portrayal of Barbieland and the lifestyles and states of the Barbies in the early stages carries a strong sense of postfeminism.


Surprisingly, the film ingeniously transitions to Barbie crossing over into the real world and embarking on a series of explorations regarding gender, emotions, life, and death. This breaks the singular fantasy that Barbie and female viewers may have about Barbieland, preventing the story from becoming a mindless action flick. The film not only advocates for body diversity and inclusivity in women but also delves deeply into Barbie's journey of personal growth, showcasing how she transforms from an innocent and simple assembly line doll into a fully realized human being with genuine emotions and a strong sense of self-will. In this regard, ""Barbie"" truly reconstructs the meaning of Barbie, imbuing its feminism with a more enriching and sincere undertone.

**Intriguing Plot and Character Designs**


Proactively deconstructing oneself
Two particularly memorable scenes stand out in this regard. First, Margot Robbie's Barbie, in a self-deprecating manner, criticizes her own appearance while others hurriedly try to console her. Suddenly, a voice-over interjects, implying that even the director chose Margot Robbie to play the role of Barbie, making the self-critique less convincing (laughs). The second scene involves the CEO of the Barbie manufacturer rejecting the film's mom character's passionate plea for aesthetic diversity in Barbie's production. However, as soon as his subordinate suggests that this approach could be highly profitable, he immediately changes his stance, simultaneously mocking capitalism and poking fun at himself.

Filming war scenes
This film is packed with entertaining plot twists and visuals, one of which includes a chaotic gathering of Ken soldiers amidst Kendom's disarray. Greta transforms the typical war scene, filled with sword fights and rivers of blood, into a lively and adorable virtual pet brawl, showcasing her unique and imaginative approach.

Allan's character design
The design of the character Allan is also quite intriguing. In a Barbieland where all males are named Ken and all females are named Barbie, where gender traits and boundaries are distinct, Allan stands out as a one-of-a-kind existence, defying any specific gender definition, be it in name, personality, or appearance. This adds a touch of queerness to the film.

Homage to various works
""Barbie"" pays homage to several classic films, showcasing their imaginative style. Examples include the opening sequence reminiscent of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" the choice between two pills reminiscent of ""The Matrix,"" and the dance choreography of the Ken characters during the civil war, which nods to ""Singing in the Rain"" (Greta has expressed her love for this film in multiple interviews, showing genuine appreciation!).

""I want to see a gynecologist""
Initially, the significance of this final line may be unclear, but thanks to explanations from online users, it becomes apparent. Barbie, originally a doll devoid of human reproductive organs, mentioning a gynecologist implies that she now has a vagina. The desire to visit a gynecologist can be seen as her way of exploring and understanding herself as a human being.

When it comes to flaws in this film, one could argue that the pacing of the narrative is too fast, at times feeling abrupt, such as in the resolution of the mother-daughter conflict. However, one could also argue that this is a deliberate choice driven by its commercial nature, and in a way, it aligns with the film's whimsical and imaginative style.


One scene in particular deeply touched me, and that is the ending where Barbie's creator, Ruth Handler, and Barbie herself transcend the barriers of time and space to come face to face once again. The elderly Handler gazes tenderly at the doll she once single-handedly brought to life, encouraging her to bravely explore the possibilities of life and accompany her through the final stage of her awakening. In this seemingly frozen moment, the love they share flows gently in the soft whispers of Billie Eilish.


In the end, both Ken and Barbie find their own purpose and value, and through their individual journeys of growth, the film constructs a vision of an ideal world:


In this world,


everyone has the right and courage to be themselves.


In this world,


It’s not Barbie and Ken，


It’s not Ken and Barbie，


It’s Barbie and it’s Ken。",2024-01-17T03:12:26.896Z,346698,4 stars,0.4446759521961212

In my opinion, this movie was well-executed, striking a balance between fantasy and reality. ""Barbie"" takes viewers on an exhilarating journey, bringing the beloved doll and cartoon character to life in a spectacular live-action adaptation.

Margot Robbie shines in her role as Barbie, delivering a fantastic performance alongside a talented cast. While there were a few questionable choices in terms of casting, such as introducing a transgender Barbie character, it did not detract from the overall appeal of the film. While it may have caused some confusion among viewers, the movie's charm remained intact.

America Ferrera delivers a powerful and empowering monologue in the film, showcasing her incredible talent and versatility as an actress. Her transition from ""Ugly Betty"" to this role is commendable, and she truly stands out in the movie.

""Barbie"" is a fun and quirky film that may not be suitable for very young children or those who prefer to shield their kids from certain themes in movies. It offers an over-the-top experience that may not be everyone's cup of tea.

Man…. I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have.

Brent Marchant,7.0,"In the interest of full disclosure, I’m often somewhat skeptical about films that include the word “part” in their titles; I frequently feel that such offerings have difficulty standing on their own, unable to complete their stories in a single vehicle. So, admittedly, that consideration was on my mind as I screened the first half of the final installment in this long-running action-adventure franchise. To its credit, director Christopher McQuarrie’s latest has a lot going for it – an intriguing plot with a strong cautionary tale message for us about the potential dangers of AI, an array of superbly staged action sequences, the welcome addition of some much-needed comic relief (something this series has often lacked) and a fine cast of supporting performers (especially the expanded role of Vanessa Kirby, who was woefully underused in the franchise’s previous release). However, with that said, there are some elements that could use improvement. For starters, the picture is simply too long; with a runtime of 2:43:00 (and this is just the first half of the story!), the film is definitely bloated and could stand some judicious editing, especially in the action sequences, several of which begin to try one’s patience after a while. Then there are certain aspects of the narrative that are predictable, formulaic, and, at times, implausible (particularly in the picture’s overlong final act train adventure sequence), qualities that are not as apparent (or at least better hidden) in previous outings. Finally, there are the underwhelming performances of the IMF crew (Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames). The leader of the pack (Cruise) comes across more like someone whose presence is designed largely to carry the plot rather than serve as a genuine, actively engaged protagonist, and his two colleagues are underused, seemingly playing sidekick roles rather than participating as key characters (unlike previous installments in the series). All told, this is by no means a bad picture, but it could have been better, especially with it being the series finale. It makes me wonder if the full story of “Dead Reckoning” might have been better executed in a single, slightly longer offering than as two separate feature-length releases. That might have solved the issues noted above, and it may have eliminated that nagging “part” problem I wrote about, allowing the picture to stand on its own two feet as a single vehicle. We’ll have to wait another year to see how it all plays out, but I can’t exactly say I’m holding my breath about it.",2023-07-16T01:36:35.068Z,575264,4 stars,0.39751771092414856
CinemaSerf,7.0,"I'm not really a great fan of Tom Cruise. Yes, he does his own stunts and is as fit as a fiddle, but as an actor - well don't let's have too many scenes that require him to actually put his heart and soul into them. Luckily, there are only a few such scenes here as the rest of this is an enjoyable, quickly paced, continuation of the MI strand with this time, an elusive antagonist that reminded me a little of the ""Forbin Project"" (1970). The military have created the perfect intelligence that is locked into the sonar dome of a state-of-the-art Russian submarine. Seems though, that this dome isn't that impregnable and when a cleverly manipulated catastrophe hits the sub, it soon becomes clear that this gadget has, and is rapidly honing, a mind of it's own. The only way to stop it is to obtain the two conjoining parts of a cruciform key - and then discover the location of the sunken wreck, if there is to be any hope of thwarting it taking over the world. The story is more the stuff of ""007"", I thought, but it is a good, solid and well written story - and one that resonates well on a planet where technology and communications are pervasive across all aspects of our lives. Together with Ving Rhames and the (always annoying, sorry) Simon Pegg it falls to ""Ethan"" (Cruise) to ally with his deadly pal ""Ilsa"" (Rebecca Ferguson) and the nimble-fingered ""Grace"" (Hayley Atwell) to stop the key from falling into the hands of the enigmatic ""Gabriel"" (Esai Morales). End-to-end action; trains, planes and automobiles, parachutes and just like in ""Fast X"" (2023) poor old Rome comes in for a bit of a pasting - as does Venice and the Orient Express would now present even ""Hercule Poirot"" with an insurmountable whodunnit challenge. It's entertaining and serves well as a vehicle for the star, setting up the concluding part which, of course, leaves the plot here having to be a little undercooked and a touch predictable. Better than I was expecting and well worth a big screen outing.",2023-07-21T10:22:15.048Z,575264,3 stars,0.4742850065231323
MovieGuys,6.0,"Spectacular cinematic action let down by an incoherent story and shallow characterisations. 

As is almost always the case with the MI franchise, the latest offering dishes up spectacular, highly polished, explosive action. Regrettably it comes at the price of a coherent story and rounded characterisations. 

The story feels like it was made to accommodate the excess of exposition. Its a jumbled mess of poorly articulated ideas, that is, unsurprisingly, difficult to follow. Its not helped at all by an over abundance of peripheral characters. They simply add to the confused jumble and just as unsurprisingly, are never given the chance to display any depth of characterisation. 

The results a film I personally found frustrating to watch. It boiled down to a series of action plot devices, including car chases and train wrecks. Certainly, some thought went into these sequences but because there is an absence of a solid story and believable characters, to cement the whole thing together, they don't amount to much, on their own.

In short, polished action but for me, lacks the key factors that bind any film together, including a decent story and characterisations. In short, I can't really recommend this one, in spite of being a fan of the franchise.",2023-07-23T22:35:58.004Z,575264,2 stars,0.6894062161445618
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,9.0,"The Tom Cruise “Mission Impossible” franchise is one of reliable quality and equally dependable “forgettable-ness.” I’ve seen every film, yet my memory is fuzzy when I try to recall what happened in any of them. And while it’s almost a given that “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” will somehow sadly meet a similar fate, it’s still one of the best of the bunch. Not one thing disappointed me about this seventh installment in the series, an exciting and entertaining ride that gets almost everything right. This is an absolutely terrific action movie that overdelivers, and I loved every minute of it.

World class field agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) works as a field agent for an elite, top-secret branch of the CIA called the IMF (Impossible Mission Force). His team, including associates Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) have become close friends, and they’re a well-oiled machine when working together. They regroup to embark on a dangerous mission to track down a new weapon that threatens all of humanity. The entire world is at stake, and Ethan must find a device before it falls into the wrong hands while dealing with some dark skeletons of his own past.

In order to get the most enjoyment out of the film, it’s best not to read too much about the plot. What works so well about the story is that it has a modern angle, and the motivations of the villains are extremely strong. The stakes are high and there’s a very real danger, which adds to the overall excitement. As one character puts it, they’re fighting “an enemy that’s everywhere and nowhere.” It’s smart, sophisticated, and polished in a way that tends to evade your typical summer blockbuster.

There are a few high tech, double cross, master of disguise elements, but they aren’t used as a distracting gimmick (as they sometimes have been in previous MI films). The high-concept action scenes are energetic and absolutely thrilling, making for some very clever and inventive spectacles. From a dramatic footrace through the canals of Venice to motorcycle jumps in the Austrian Alps to an epic car chase through the streets of Rome, there’s never a dull moment. There’s an inspired, extended sequence on a runaway train that will go down in history as one of the most creative and fun action scenes of the year, if not ever.

There are plenty of strong female characters in the story, including the new addition of Grace (Hayley Atwell), a crackerjack larcenist, and Paris (Pom Klementieff), a fierce bodyguard who gives off strong Harley Quinn vibes. This movie, simply put, is packed with badass women. Seeing the gang reunited is always fun, and Pegg and Rhames have created characters that feel like old friends. There’s excellent work from the supporting cast too (Vanessa Kirby, Esai Morales, and Shea Whigham). Cruise is starting to show his age, but he’s still one of Hollywood’s greatest working superstars. His performance is reliable, charismatic, and believable, which is exactly what it needs to be.

It’s clear that this is a movie that’s older and wiser and in turn, it’s made with more mature audiences in mind. Nothing is dumbed down, the emotional meter runs high, and the level of style and poise is unexpected and welcome (and to be commended). This is a classic espionage thriller that achieves a balance between artistry and pleasure, which is no easy feat.

“Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning” is the first part of a two part saga, but the finale isn’t so open-ended that it leads to frustration. Instead, it’s more of an excitement-based cliffhanger that’ll leave you salivating for the second half. This is a movie that could stand alone, but I’m awfully glad it doesn’t.",2023-08-04T07:02:36.097Z,575264,4 stars,0.6008914709091187

JPV852,8.0,"Good stuntwork as usual from this series and the performances were well done and nice seeing the return of Henry Czeny as Kittridge and filling in the gaps from the first movie and that deal made with Max. They did a decent enough job with a villain that was essentially A.I. by giving it a face with Esai Morales's Gabriel character, albeit compared with the others in the franchise, was pretty weak. And for Cruise, he's at home as Ethan Hunt while the rest of the team had their moments.

The only drawback is some of the dialogue, especially during the intelligence agencies meeting, felt stilted probably because it was basically exposition dump.

It's not on the level of the past few movies but still entertaining, just had hoped the splitting of two movies thing was over and done with or at least was made justifiable (like Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame), which I'm not sure it is here. **3.75/5**",2023-10-29T06:14:19.708Z,575264,3 stars,0.7025198936462402
snunes97,6.0,"This is the weakest M:I movie so far, which doesn't mean it's bad but it definitely has a few critical issues. The smaller issue is the pointless action sequences. This movie has a couple of overly long sequences that drag on for way too long and serve no purpose. They bring nothing new to the table in terms of stunts and don't add anything to the story. It's just padding and noise. However, the biggest issue is the plot about artificial intelligence. The filmmakers seem very insecure about the audience's ability to understand the themes used in the story. As a result, there are multiple long scenes where characters sit in a room and repeatedly speak about certain plot elements, in different levels of detail, as if they're trying to make sure the audience understands what they're talking about. I think ""rogue computer program"" is something that most people would understand, but the movie really tries to make this concept much deeper than it needs to be for the purpose of the movie, resulting in multiple needlessly complex exposition scenes. All of this to say that the movie could have been 30 minutes shorter if you could trim the pointless action sequences and the tech jargon. As it stands, Dead Reckoning Part Two is going to have to do some very heavy lifting in order to compensate for this bloated Part One.",2023-12-27T02:05:24.218Z,575264,2 stars,0.5622886419296265
whitsbrain,8.0,"**Mission Impossible** has been out-Bonding James Bond for years now. Tom Cruise continues to churn out movies that bring more fun and escapism than anyone else. He's a strange guy but his run of super-entertaining films over the last couple of decades has been amazing. This time, his character Ethan Hunt battles an all-knowing AI called ""The Entity"" and frankly, it's kind of a lame villain. The embodiment (sort of) of The Entity is Gabriel, who gives Ethan a baddie that he can punch. It's all rather confusing and convoluted, but the cast of characters and the action sequences are really what makes this latest **MI** movie a blast. Again.

I was actually looking most forward to seeing Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa. Her character has always brought so much acrobatic grace and fridged detachment to her fighting in scraps with the bad guys. She isn't in this installment much, but when she is, it's impossible to look away. In fact, the ladies of **MI:7** are the best thing about it. Grace (Hayley Atwell) is magnetic and provides some real chemistry with Ethan. She was the person to care about the most. She was tough but also just naive enough to want to invest in emotionally. Her final ""deal"" with Kittridge makes me wonder if they are setting her up as the main character once Cruise leaves the franchise. The characters of Paris and The White Widow owned their screen time, as well. And of course, Luther and Benji are a solid pair, dropping in and out of the movie as needed.

Thinking back on the action, there were so many great sequences. The runaway train was great but the car chase in Rome was one of the best that I can remember seeing in any movie.

As has been stated often by others, this movie is a little long and the fact that it's a ""Part One"" doesn't help it at all, but the strong cast and balls-to-the-wall action make this another very good entry in the **Mission Impossible** series.",2024-01-30T19:55:24.874Z,575264,4 stars,0.6788278818130493
Per Gunnar Jonsson,7.0,"Overall this is a fairly entertaining movie. It has a reasonably cool, totally unrealistic of course, but cool story. It has plenty of special effects, lots of action, some mild suspense and a bit, sometimes too much, humor.

Overall it is in the same style as the previous movies and that brings me to the gripe I have had with these movies since the movie part of the franchise started. This is yet another movie where Ethan is betrayed and goes off doing his own thing. Seriously? The original Mission Impossible was agents doing cool stuff with the full backing of their organisation. Not this bloody Hollywood secret agent soap opera crap.

Another issue I have is that, as usual when Hollywood tries to wander into areas of technology, the basic premise of the movie is just totally unrealistic. There’s no way the computing power available on a submarine would be sufficient to house an actual Artificial Intelligence. Also, at the bottom of the sea there’s no bloody connection to be used for taking over the world unless you count low frequency submarine communication which would make an old 300 baud telephone modem look lightning fast.

Yes I ment baud, not bps, in that last sentence by the way.

Apart from those really annoying faults the movie was, as I wrote pretty good. The special effects were over the top of course but not so totally over the top as in some movies. Sometimes they were really dragged out until they became too much though. Like the obligatory car chase or the forever falling of a cliff train.

I also have to say that Nathan being screwed over, over and over again by that bitch became tiresome rather quickly. So did Benji’s often ridiculous behavior.

So 3 1/2 out of 5 stars it is. Could have been better but could also have been a lot worse.",2024-03-11T15:14:44.679Z,575264,3 stars,0.8269421458244324
Angel Brown,9.0,"Christopher McQuarrie and Tom Cruise return with another high-octane installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise, delivering breathtaking action, a gripping story, and a sense of urgency that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats. Dead Reckoning Part One is not just a typical spy thriller; it’s a showcase of practical stunts, sharp storytelling, and an evolving narrative that sets the stage for the franchise’s most ambitious chapter yet.

The film follows Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team—Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson)—as they go up against a new, ominous threat: an advanced artificial intelligence known as ""The Entity."" With a rogue key holding control over this AI, Ethan races against time to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands, all while being pursued by a relentless assassin (Esai Morales) and facing the return of former ally-turned-rival, Gabriel.

What sets Dead Reckoning Part One apart is its ability to balance large-scale action with emotional stakes. Tom Cruise once again defies the limits of human endurance, executing jaw-dropping stunts—including a now-iconic motorcycle jump off a cliff. Meanwhile, the ensemble cast shines, with standout performances from Hayley Atwell as Grace, a mysterious thief drawn into the chaos, and Pom Klementieff as a deadly adversary.

The action sequences are among the franchise's best, particularly a tension-filled train sequence that rivals any set piece in modern action cinema. Lorne Balfe’s intense score amplifies the stakes, while the cinematography captures stunning global locations, from Venice to Abu Dhabi.

If there’s one drawback, it’s that the film is only part one of a larger story, leaving some threads unresolved. However, the pacing, character depth, and sheer spectacle make it a worthy entry in the Mission: Impossible saga. With a thrilling finale that sets up Part Two, this film cements the franchise’s reputation as one of the best in action cinema.

Brent Western,7.0,"First, let’s address the obvious. Tom Cruise definitely has a type. Every single romantic interest or possible romantic interest in these movies are always brunettes. Every single potential foil, foe or enemy is always blonde. Don’t know if there’s more to it than that, but it’s something I’ve noticed over the years.

The movie started off a bit odd with an opening sequence that really doesn’t get explained until halfway through the movie. Your left wondering if you miss something for the first 30 minutes of the movie. The usual names and faces are there and you can feel the comfort with the character as you settle in to watch the first half of the finale.

One of the so-called twist about halfway through the movie was so obvious that I was surprised they followed through with it. Sad to see a character go to go in the way that they did.


Also, as a sidenote, I’m disappointed Michelle Monahan doesn’t make an appearance in this or the final movie. With the amount of times that she’s been found, wouldn’t she have been better off staying with Ethan than doing all of these spy tactics just to be found anyway anyways?


Even though the action sequences were great, they weren’t as adventurous or extreme as they have been in previous movies. Not to take away from what they were or the people who performed them, it just didn’t have the same level of excitement and suspense as some of the others did.


Any two part movie always seems to fall flat, because the first part is always setting up the second part. It’s no different here, but I’m looking forward to finishing the saga as we approach the second part of the finale.",2025-05-09T17:11:22.306Z,575264,3 stars,0.4366191327571869
r96sk,8.0,"<em>'Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning'</em> is a fun M:I movie, certainly. Admittedly, I am someone - despite enjoying all of them to a fairly solid degree - who has a relatively lukewarm feeling for these flicks, at least compared to other franchises.

These go in one ear and out the other if I'm totally honest. That does sound negative, but it honestly isn't because I certainly have the desired entertainment with 'em whilst watching; they just don't stick in the old memory bank, that's all. That's arguably by design, no? Perhaps that part is harsh.

This seventh entry does set things up nicely for the currently-in-theaters sequel, which I am looking forward to. The action, stunts, cast and music are the big strengths pf this series and those departments are practically perfected here, that theme song will forever be iconic.

Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise, a performance of quality as one would expect. Hayley Atwell is a great addition, while it's nice to see Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg again. The rest of those onscreen are impressive as well, namely Pom Klementieff and Esai Morales.

I'm not sure this needed to be split in two with that noted follow-up, but I guess the proof will be in the pudding when I hopefully watch that 2025 release soon. I'm positive it'll be fun to see, either way.",2025-05-22T01:38:18.417Z,575264,4 stars,0.4934743642807007

MovieGuys,6.0,"Hidden Strike is a functional East meets West, military action thriller.

There's reasonable chemistry between Jackie Chan and John Cena. Both are likeable and function well together, as an action duo.Chan has a well established background in this kind of film, backed by decent martial arts skills, that are, once again, on display. Cena has an imposing  physical presence that works equally as well. It helps no end either, that both can actually act. 

Where this film falls down somewhat is it feels a little random. I think the key issue is there is a lack of building cohesive momentum towards a final show down, with the bad guy. Instead, what you get is a series of well choreographed gun and fight scenes, that feel ""loosely thrown together"" in a way that sort of works, just not terribly well.

Had more thought be put into linking these scenes into a more cohesive thematic story, it would have been a much better experience.

In summary, decent action, decent chemistry between the action buddy duo. Let down somewhat by an overly loose and disjointed approach, to the overriding action sequences and the basic story they are supposed to help tell.",2023-07-31T03:43:47.288Z,457332,3 stars,0.5988819003105164

Can they unite, put their differences behind them and rally to defeat their nemesis and close the portal for ever? Well, sadly I didn't really care. This is really just a revamp of the first ""Insidious"" (2010) film with some added teenage angst, familial discord and little enough by way of contributions from the other siblings to give any depth to this routine father and son drama that save for the slightly livelier denouement was really rather predictable and dull. There are a few jump moments mid-way through the drama, but for the rest of it it seems that Wilson was perhaps too preoccupied with both of his roles here to focus properly on either, and that leaves us with a rather unremarkable muddle of a film that I'm afraid is just instantly forgettable.",2023-07-22T14:38:53.462Z,614479,3 stars,0.4999743103981018
EmmanuelGoldstein,1.0,"As someone who was a victim of child sexual abuse myself and as someone who admittedly likes Trump (who praised this movie to no end) and also as a tiny bit of conspiracy nut and seeing all the mainstream media attack this movie and trying to smear it, I really, REALLY wanted to like and support and even praise this movie - but I just can't.

I have to admit that it's a bit difficult for me to agree with the mainstream media's warning about this movie, but they really are correct for once - sometimes they throw you curve balls like that. I mean after all, there was a time when I trusted the mainstream media and I lost trust in them not because they were mainstream, but because they just started to get a lot of things wrong. But that also means that if they get things right for once, I can't just categorically disagree with them.

And it's really not like they are just smearing this movie for no good reason. They do (for the most part) have a valid point. This movie does nothing to actually stop this crime or to help the victims or to help people recognize this crime when they see it. On the contrary, because it claims to be based on true events, it causes people to have a completely wrong impression about this and therefore makes it harder for people to detect it when it's happening, because this movie is less accurate in its depiction of the real world than a Liam Neeson action thriller. Actually, Liam Neeson's recent film ""Memory"" was pretty good and actually much more accurate in it's depiction of child trafficking than this movie.

Because this movie really does nothing but reinforce outdated and completely wrong stereotypes. This type of thing isn't something that mainly happens in South America or in ""other"" countries and children don't just get kidnapped out of the blue by complete strangers and against their will. The sad truth is that most cases don't involve a stranger at all, but someone the child trusts and the child isn't gonna come running to you begging for help, cause the truth is they are victims of years of extremely systematic and sophisticated psychological manipulation.

And the perpetrators aren't all tough guys either. Actually a lot of them are quite educated, sophisticated and female because they don't raise suspicion. And also it's not just about forcing the kids to make movies - that only plays a very, very small part, but this movie would have you believe that that's the main part - that's the smallest part by far! Most of the aspects involved are MUCH worse than ""just"" that. 

And as much as I would love to think that there are plenty of officers (official or rogue) of government security agencies who are incorruptible and ceaselessly fight the ""bad guys"" in relentless sting operations, the reality sadly isn't as clear cut. Yes, sometimes SOME children do get rescued, but actually very rarely by police, much less government security agencies. Well, there was that ONE case in Bosnia where a policewoman and member of an international agency uncovered a human trafficking operation - but then again the people running it were her colleagues...",2023-07-28T00:22:40.036Z,678512,2 stars,0.47497186064720154
Wuchak,6.0,"**_Sorta “Taken 4,” but starring Jim Caviezel and focusing on children enslaved by sex traffickers_**

A Homeland Security agent (Caviezel) in SoCal tracks down people involved in child pornography, but he decides to leave the agency to save children trapped in sex slavery, starting with a little boy from Honduras. He teams-up with a former cartel accountant (Bill Camp) to track down the kid’s sister in which he must eventually infiltrate a camp of Columbian revolutionaries in the Amazon jungle.

Made in 2018 but not released until 2023, “Sound of Freedom” is based on the real-life story of Tim Ballard, the founder of Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.). It features actual footage of children being captured by slavers on CCTV. Imagine a more gritty-realistic version of the “Taken” movies, with Liam being replaced by Caviezel, and that’s this film.

This is a well-done, eye-opening picture about the perverted human cockroaches amongst us, but it isn’t entertaining in the conventional sense for obvious reasons. It amusingly became anathema to Lefties, also for obvious reasons.      

The flick runs 2 hours, 11 minutes, and was shot in Cartagena, Colombia with additional scenes done in Calexico, California.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Though at times I felt luck played a bit too much of an hand in this drama, it's still quite a potent telling of the story of dedicated real-life agent Tim Ballard (Jim Caviezel) who spent much of his time working for the US Government trying to thwart the activities of people traffickers. More specifically, of those odious and venal monsters who kidnap and trade in young children who are destined to populate the sex industry and end up drug addicts and diseased in the process. When he rescues a young boy from such a scenario, he discovers that his sister was also taken - and the youngster and his father implore Ballard to try to find her too. Impossible, you might think - but a lucky break points in the direction of a lawless area of the Colombian jungle where even the local army doesn't go. Working closely with a man with quite a murky past and now his highly useful general factotum Vampiro (Bill Camp), they head off, disguised as doctors, into the wilderness. Can he locate her? Can he rescue her and get out alive? No, there's not oodles of jeopardy about any of that - but this film really does use this seemingly impossible mission to shine a light on these disgusting practices that still thrive in ostensibly civilised, Christian societies. Cavielzel is on good form here offering us an hybrid of adventure and action coupled with a highly developed moral compass. Camp, likewise, delivers quite a charismatic effort and local copper Jorge (Javier Godino) adds an extra dimension proving that the Colombian authorities found this practice just as revolting as anyone else. It's not brutal nor particularly graphic, it just allows our own imagination to put two and two together here and is a really effective indictment of a behaviour that truly turns the stomach. From a creative perspective, the photography - especially in the jungle - is first rate and all-in-all this is a thought provoking enterprise that's well worth two hours of your time.",2023-10-19T11:59:20.700Z,678512,4 stars,0.6591018438339233

Indeed, it's a sort of ""Little Mermaid"" in reverse that I actually found a bit predictable and dull. It's also unclear as to whom this film is for. The kids at the screening I was at were largely disinterested in the whole enterprise, it was too old for some and too young for others - and there is very little for the adults to take away either.

Lachlan Thiele,4.0,"EXT. INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF THE LOST DIALS SKULL – DAY

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is more closely related to its recent sequel than its distant cousins of the original trilogy. It attempts to take the franchise's formula and shake it up; it throws in cameos, call-backs and references but suffers the same issue every recent Lucasfilm movie has. 

It's another modern Disney reboot sequel with legacy characters left in the dirt, and a 'quirky & quippy' new character is presented to us. You know this character type when in the face of fear, they will make fun of the villain's Lactose Intolerance or something random because this character is flawlessly confident. They are knowledgeable on every subject relevant to the plot, smartasses because they are always correct, sassy when held hostage and always have an escape plan. This is Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridges), and she might be the only consistent character in the film. For the rest of the ensemble, Boyd Holbrooks Klaber speaks once in the movie and then chases after Jones in each scene; Mads Mikkelsens Jürgen Voller is the most forgettable antagonist of the franchise, Antonio Banderas is out of the film faster than he's in it and finally, Harrison Ford as Dr Jones is unfortunately back for what seems like a pretty good paycheck.

I have nothing against the performances themselves. The cast is incredibly talented, but this skilled team cannot hide the terrible dialogue reinforcing the rather forgettable story. Ultimately, Indiana Jones has one of the greatest trilogies of films with a distance spin-off universe of sequels. Lucasfilm, post-2008, has not been your era.

garethmb,-1.0,"Legendary archaeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), has returned to what is the film as his final outing in ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"". The film is the first in the series since Disney acquired Lucasfilm and the first not to benefit from involvement by Gorge Lucas or the direction of Steven Spielberg. James Mangold has taken on directing duties and faces the challenge of delivering a satisfying solution to the series and one that atones for the disappointing ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"".
The film opens in the waning days of World War II when the imminent defeat of the Nazis has caused a mass exodus of their plundered archaeological treasures which draws Jones into the mix.

The digital de-aging technology is impressive as we get an extended sequence of the younger Jones and his colleague Basil Shaw (Toby Jones), in a frantic and at times humorous segment that evokes memories of some of the finer moments from the series.
Flash forward to 1969 as the world prepares to celebrate the return of the lunar astronauts, Jones is dealing with the pending retirement from teaching as well as issues in his personal life.
When a figure from his past named Helena (Phoene Waller-Bridge) who happens to be his Goddaughter evokes memories of a disagreement with her father several years earlier over the fabled Dial of Destiny which Indiana and her father were able to retrieve half of earlier in the film.

At the same time former Nazi scientists Jurgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen), who is receiving his kudos as a key part of sending men to the moon and back, plots to obtain both parts of the Dial and with his legion of deadly assassins in tow, sets his sights on Jones and Shaw.

Things become even more complicated when Jones is framed for murder and forced to flee in pursuit of Shaw sees archaeological discoveries as nothing more than a financial gain versus their historical significance.
From New York to Tangiers, Greece, and other locales, Jones, Shaw, and her sidekick Teddy (Ethan Isidore), this battle against each other as well as the menace that constant Voller presents as they attempt to decipher the clues to combine the Dial and keep it from those who use it evil.

The film takes its time getting to the action as it is interspersed throughout the film and while not the FX-laden visual abundance that modern audiences have come to expect, they are generally satisfying and factor in that the title character is a senior citizen pushing 80 and as such does some remarkably impressive action when called upon even though he does in one scene to lying about his various injuries and trials that he has faced over the years and the toll they take it upon his body.

Some fans may say there was not enough action for the hook was not as compelling as in previous adventures. While this is certainly a valid thought process the film should delight true fans of the series as it is an appropriate look at the aging adventurer as he is pulled back into the field once again.  There is also the matter of the new music from John Williams which sets the tone for the film well.

Ford and Waller-Bridge work well with one another and there are some surprise guests that appear along the way one should delight fans. I found the movie to be more satisfying than the last two films in that the focus was on the character and themes of life, loss, aging, and doing what was right versus an abundance of action around a treasure hunt.

It will be different things to different people but for me, ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is a loving send-off to the beloved character and one that cements the iconic Jones as a true cinematic classic.

Brent Marchant,7.0,"It seems these days that it’s become all too easy to blast popular, commercial fare simply because it is popular, commercial fare. Granted, some offerings of this type genuinely deserve whatever grief they get, but others, such as the latest installment in this long-running franchise, don’t merit unfair potshots fired at them just for innately being mainstream offerings. In many ways, this is very much cut from the same cloth as its action adventure predecessors, but there are enough distinctions, new developments and lesser-known elements to keep it fresh and interesting throughout. Now, this is not to suggest that this final entry in this action adventure series is without its faults – it’s overlong, some of its action sequences could have been easily pared back (despite generally being as good as they are) and the storyline tends to sag somewhat in the middle. However, Indiana Jones has once again given us a rollicking good time with a captivating narrative, an intriguing assortment of twists and turns, and an array of colorful characters all vying for their piece of the pie (if not the entire pie itself). The film also provides fans of the franchise with deftly handled touches at achieving closure for the series, without dangling obvious or ambiguous carrots of there being more to come or any kind of impending reboot. Director James Mangold successfully puts the series to bed and tucks it in nicely while rounding off any remaining edges, something that it and its fans deserve. So, to all those cynics out there who are shamelessly bashing this release to be fashionable or hip, all I can say is “pipe down and lose the attitude already.”",2023-07-03T01:27:50.251Z,335977,3 stars,0.4695902466773987

Trevor Morris,7.0,"When the title card for the latest Indiana Jones movie came on the big screen I was excited to hear the famous score, see Harrison Ford don his famous fedora and intrigued to see how they would handle Indy’s age in this 40-year-old franchise.

The opening encounter was very familiar, with Indy fighting Nazis during World War 2. We are introduced to the antiquity and lore that is the basis for this adventure. This start was a little jarring at first, but I was soon enthralled by the action and comedy.

I enjoyed Toby Jones' brief appearance at the beginning, but the villain played by Mads Mikkelsen was severely underutilised. The runtime was a little long, with the middle feeling rather lethargic. I would have preferred a little more low-key adventuring, similar to the exploration of Archimedes's tomb, than the bigger action sequences.

There was a definite nostalgia kick to the entire movie. There was a new young sidekick and old familiar faces. There was the trademark adventure, creepy crawlies and historical riddles. There were Nazis, car chases and fight scenes. There was some fun deadpan comedy. The iconic travel map made an appearance – with a couple in front pointing at the screen in excitement when it appeared. But it was hearing the score throughout that was the biggest endorphin kick. It was definitely an Indiana Jones movie.

Fifteen years after the disappointing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, this is a satisfying movie that I enjoyed. In the end, it concludes Indy’s story, while potentially passing the adventuring on to another generation.",2023-07-11T19:21:56.704Z,335977,4 stars,0.5062370896339417
Chris Sawin,1.0,"_Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny_ feels like the type of sequel that aimed to capture the magic of its predecessors, had worthwhile intentions, and a talented cast, but it just never properly materialized. The film seems to teeter on the sheer annoyance of a main character grappling with the fact that he’s now a crotchety and wrinkly senior citizen and not the young, grizzled, adventurer he used to be.

With an ending that leaves the Indiana Jones character in a satisfying bookend for the franchise, hopefully _The Dial of Destiny_ is the final Indy film. Like Roger Murtaugh in _Lethal Weapon_, Harrison Ford is literally too old for this sh*t.

GenerationofSwine,1.0,"It took me a while to work up the courage to see this.  I mean, Indiana Jones was my hero as a child.  When I was sick I used to watch Raiders over and over again and that was a tradition I kept up through high school.

And now... Thank you Doomcock, without your intervention this movie would have been even worse.  It shows, the plot is messy, the re-shoots are a little obvious story-wise as Disney did their best to attempt to avoid the fan backlash promised for when their plans were to kill Indy off and have Phoebe replace him....

... and then when when they re-shoot it again because the fans didn't want to see Indiana Jones be ridiculed constantly by his female replacement in an effort to make the KK stand-in come across as better in every way... and a lot of that is still there in the final product.

Like Star Wars did to Skywalker, Indiana Jones is constantly shamed by the younger more diverse version... who can't seem to decide what character she wants to be.  Rogue?  Scholar?  Conman? Her personality changes as the script dictates, but Indiana remains pathetic... so that Strong Female Lead can look better.

In the end it's a mess, and the result is that Disney killed another fan favorite Franchise.  Star Wars, Willow, and now Indy.  They paid out the nose for all of them and then made them worthless.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"A Nazi colonel is moving some looted artworks towards the end of WWII - amongst which is the legendary lance that supposedly pierced the body of Christ. Luckily - for the colonel, that is - renowned archeologist ""Voller"" (Mads Mikkelsen) is on hand to advise that it's a fake - but by way of compensation, he informs the man that there is a far greater artefact on board their train. The ""Dial of Destiny"" - designed of old by Archimedes and reputed to have the ability to facilitate time travel. Our eponymous and intrepid adventurer is also on the train, with his scholarly pal ""Basil"" (Toby Jones) and together they manage to secure this gadget and flee - only to find that it is but half of the device. Years go by and ""Indy"" (Harrison Ford) is now a soon-to-be divorced, retiring, professor who encounters the daughter of his late friend - ""Helena/Wombat"" (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) and soon the two are engaged as a slightly untrustworthy pairing seeking to retrieve the other half of this dial before the newly empowered ""Voller"" manages to manipulate the CIA into helping him to obtain it and rewrite history. Aside from the fact that the star is still very much a star, and his charisma does lots to keep this going; the film is itself a really rather unremarkable, procedural, adventure story that includes all the staple ingredients of the first three films but without the depth of the supporting characters. Mikkelsen doesn't really cut it as a baddie any more and Waller-Bridge is largely out of her depth and relies rather heavily on her teenage sidekick ""Teddy"" (Ethann Isidore) to be the foil for her rather obvious witticisms and slightly unscrupulous behaviour. It doesn't hang about and the visual effects are pretty standard but the writing is really quite pedestrian and the ending seemed borne more of a need to finish the film rather than complete the really pretty thin story that really does tee up a sequel!

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,5.0,"“Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” is a stale, impotent summer blockbuster that marks another unimaginative entry in the popular adventure franchise. Excessively dull and far too long, director James Mangold‘s movie burns every last drop of goodwill that’s left in the tank. This fifth and final installment in the Indiana Jones saga is a pathetic sendoff to one of the most iconic big screen characters of all time.

Set in 1969, Daredevil archaeologist Henry “Indiana” Jones (Harrison Ford) is still working as a professor, but today is his retirement day. In his final class, a young woman from his past turns up: his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). She’s in search of a mystical device that her father Basil Shaw (Toby Jones) obsessed over until the day he died, and Indy knows its historical significance all too well. It’s been said that the Antikythera (the Greek name for the Dial of Destiny), can alter the course of history and time, and it would turn any person who held it into a god. Soon Indy and Helena find out that former Nazi and current NASA scientist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) also wants the device for himself so he can change the outcome of World War II, and it becomes a race against time (and a very dangerous enemy) if they want to save history as the world knows it.

It’s not a bad story overall, but it certainly is a mess of one. It’s extremely slow, and the most interesting parts happen in the film’s final 45 minutes. That means there’s an abundance of bland filler and tepid action chase scenes that fill screen time before all the good stuff happens. There’s a lot of déjà vu at play here, as Mangold tries to milk fond memories of the earlier (and best) “Raiders” films, and he’s not shy about masking his intentions. The film brings back classic characters like Marion (Karen Allen) and Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), who only briefly appear as a means of tugging on the heartstrings (and reminding audiences of far, far better movies).

There are so many missteps in this film that it becomes more of a bore than a fun means of escapism. The opening sequence is a little fun, but it’s too reminiscent of the circus train intro in “Last Crusade.” There’s another tuk tuk chase that’s eerily familiar to the mine cars in “Temple of Doom.” The script (which credits four writers) inserts plenty of winks and nudges as it references the most classic Indiana Jones films. While the crack of Indy’s whip and the moment he dons his famous brown fedora may get those feel-good endorphins flowing, it also makes in painfully clear that a movie can only coast so far on nostalgia.

A large chunk of the problem is (surprisingly) with the character. An archaeologist outsmarting Nazi villains feels more dated in today’s society than it should, even though the film is set in the late ’60s. Indiana Jones will always be a classic of course, and the studio should be applauded for its decision not to recast Ford in what is in the top two of his most iconic roles. What’s cringey is the use of de-aging software for the scenes that take place in the past, which makes Ford look plastic, fake, and straight out of a Pixar movie. It doesn’t work, it’s distracting, and it arguably was unnecessary within the confines of the story the film is trying to tell.

One of the positives is that Ford is clearly still a movie star, and he holds the movie together with what appears to be minimal effort. Yes, it’s easy to tell when a stunt person is standing in and it’s obvious through some clever (and choppy) editing that Ford wasn’t personally able to perform all of the physicality the role demanded, but he still lives and breathes Indiana Jones, so much so that after a little bit of time, you don’t even see him as an old man. The addition of Waller-Bridge adds a refreshing spark to the film, and her character and performance are quite enjoyable.

I don’t think “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny” will perform well across generations, but Gen Xers and older audiences will be delighted to see one of their favorite characters back in his own action / adventure story. What a pity this is the best sendoff that could be mustered for Indy after all this time.",2023-08-04T07:01:49.582Z,335977,2 stars,0.5078513026237488
Draco Labs,8.0,"""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" delivers exactly what fans of the iconic adventurer have been yearning for—a thrilling, action-packed adventure that pays homage to the franchise's rich history while introducing new and captivating elements.

Harrison Ford reprises his role as Indiana Jones with the same charm and charisma that has made him a beloved cinematic icon for decades. Ford effortlessly slips back into the fedora and whip, proving that age has only added depth to the character. His portrayal is a masterclass in blending wit, humor, and vulnerability, reminding us why Indiana Jones is an enduring hero.

The supporting cast shines as well, with standout performances from newcomers and familiar faces alike. The chemistry between Ford and his co-stars is palpable, adding depth to the relationships at the core of the film. Phoebe Waller-Bridge's character, in particular, brings a refreshing and feisty dynamic to the story.

The film's plot is a rollercoaster ride of suspense and intrigue. From the moment the adventure begins, it never lets up, taking us on a globe-trotting quest filled with ancient mysteries, treacherous traps, and high-stakes encounters. ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" skillfully weaves historical and mythological elements into the narrative, providing a satisfying blend of history and fantasy.

The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular. The film's use of practical effects and practical stunts harks back to the franchise's roots and sets it apart from modern CGI-laden blockbusters. Each action set piece is meticulously choreographed and filled with heart-pounding moments that will leave you on the edge of your seat.

John Williams' iconic score is the icing on the cake, evoking a sense of nostalgia while adding new layers to the film's atmosphere. The music enhances every scene, amplifying the emotional resonance of key moments.

""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" also succeeds in exploring the character's personal journey and growth. It delves into Indy's motivations, regrets, and his enduring quest for knowledge and adventure, giving the character a deeper and more relatable dimension.

In conclusion, ""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" is a triumphant return to the beloved franchise. It manages to capture the essence of what makes Indiana Jones an enduring hero while introducing fresh elements to keep the series exciting and relevant. It's a must-see for fans and a thrilling adventure for newcomers, proving that the magic of Indiana Jones is as strong as ever.",2023-09-01T19:09:03.261Z,335977,4 stars,0.6434119343757629
r96sk,7.0,"Feels needless, but <em>'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny'</em> still gave me suitable entertainment.

I'd personally rank it higher than <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/indiana-jones-and-the-kingdom-of-the-crystal-skull/"" rel=""nofollow"">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a>'</em>, though to be honest I feel similarly about all five films from this franchise - evidently, given I've rated them all 7/10. I wasn't someone who grew up with this series and when I finally did watch it well over three years ago I didn't connect to them massively, so this fifth installment isn't too far adrift from the original trilogy. If this was much shorter, I may have even liked this more if I'm to be truthful.

So yeah, I found the run time to be excessive. It's actually paced relatively well, I'm just not convinced the story itself needed to be told over almost two and a half hours. There is good action adventure in this and the music is done nicely, that theme even gives me goosebumps despite my lack of strong affection for the films.

Cast-wise, it's positive. I'm not that much of a fan of Harrison Ford if I'm honest, don't get me wrong I have literally zero against the guy either but from this franchise and that certain other space franchise (I forget the name...) he has never stood out to me strangely. In these and those, I prefer others. Admittedly, I wanna check out his other work away from these sorta flicks. Phoebe Waller-Bridge is very good, as is Mads Mikkelsen. Ethann Isidore and Boyd Holbrook play their parts too.

badelf,10.0,"**_This review may contain spoilers._**

Nimona might be the most joyful film I've watched in a very long time. Anime or not, it's just.pure.unadulterated.fun!

Putting aside for a moment the serious subtext of the story, Nimona is a first-class super-hero, and with very real, very human emotions. On top of all that, she is a first-rate comedian too. ""Arm chopping is not a love language."" (Nimona read Chapman's book!) If I heard she was going to be at the Improv, I'd be looking for tickets!

Chloë Grace Moretz hit this character right over the outfield wall. The script, the animation, and Chloë combine to make Nimona completely magnetic. Empathize with a character? I was totally in love.

Riz Ahmed, the other lead voice, leveled right up to Chloë's energy. He played the double-minority cross he bore, with reality and complexity. Those two under-dogs make the best ever super-heroes.

The story about the production is that Disney dropped Blue Sky for ""balance sheet reasons"", with the film already 70% finished. I have serious doubts that Disney would ever let this film go untouched. Kudos to Annapurna and Netflix for picking this up.

Which brings us to the serious subtext. The script here is amazing. ""It's complicated.""

The early, and obvious, tip-off that the script is ""inclusive"", and actually about the LGBTQ+ crowd, is the gay relationship of Ballister Braveheart and Ambrosius Goldenloin. What hilarious names for these two characters. Ambrosius from the Greek meaning food of the gods. Ballister, also from Greek, meaning a type of weapon that throws something, a catapult or a crossbow.

It's truly not unreasonable to have a gay character in this story. Statistically speaking, even if you used a low 3% percentage of the population is gay (although it's more like 5-8%), then the odds of having at least one gay in a graduating class of 30 men is much better than an even money bet (60% probability to be exact). As a matter of fact even money says it's more likely to have 8-9 gays in a class of 30. I'm not kidding, or even, as Mark Twain, put it, a damn liar.

Two gay knights in the same class actually kissing then, is realistic and honest, given the statistics. No reason to raise a banner announcing it (Disney would have). It's only marginally relevant to the plot.

Now, I wouldn't presume to tell ND Stevenson, the author of the manga, what he meant. Yet, I see this girl, ""What are you?"" ""I am Nimona."", who can only say she is herself. She didn't say girl. She is a shapeshifter. A shapeshifter? a girl who is different? Who sees herself as different? A girl who maybe doesn't identify quite exactly as other girls? I see Nimona as the T in LBGTQ+. She is the symbolic ""transgender"" of the film that has a macho Todd, a gay Ambrosia, and an evil, intolerant Director who believes her view is the only valid one. If the MAGA hat fits, I say she wears it.

At some point, even Ballister who is also ""different"", but maybe not so much as Nimona, struggles to not call her a ""monster"". That is really the next level of meaning in the film: The people that want to ""drive a sword into the heart of anything different."" This peer pressure from the xenophobic crowd tempts even Ballister who, in his (brave)heart, knows it's wrong.

Ultimately, it's Nimona who exposes the subtext by telling us about her very real depression induced by society not accepting her as she is. Throughout life, she was constantly isolated, threatened and rejected for being Nimona - for being the shape-shifting (gender-shifting) she identifies as. Ballister asks her ""What if you held it in? If you didn't shape-shift?"" ""I'd die."" is her serious answer. If a person identifies as something different than her appearance, how can they deny that and live?

Depression is the real ""monster"" of the story. In this case, depression literally becomes the demon shape of Nimona. The demon can attack outward, and also inward. This is a truth of depression. A brilliant therapist once told me that depression is anger turned inward.

Anger turned inward, becoming depression, can have serious consequences. Do I need mention Robin Williams, Marilyn Monroe, Kurt Cobain, Sylvia Plath, Hunter Thompson, Vincent Van Gogh, and probably someone you know personally? Even Nimona recognizes this. ""I don't know what's scarier. The fact that everyone in this kingdom wants to run a sword through my heart... or that sometimes, I just wanna let 'em.""

Many artists, in every field, also feel this depression of not being accepted. Of being different somehow. Of being ridiculed and not understood. Of being alone in a world that doesn't see them as they really are. Nimona is able to turn that anger outward as a mischievous punk. For a while, anyway. Depression is a serious disease.

I was brilliantly blind-sided to see this subject treated by this film. I suspect everyone in the LGBTQ spectrum suffers this to some degree. I'm so amazed and thankful that ND Stevenson, Annapurna and Netflix brought this subject forward at the same time that Republicans are banning gender-affirming care in red states.

Regardless of the underlying cause, depression can be helped by therapy, tolerance, acceptance, and, as Ballister showed us, love.",2023-07-18T14:35:55.095Z,961323,4 stars,0.3444870412349701
CinemaSerf,7.0,"The Queen has broken with tradition and elevated a commoner - ""Boldheart"" to knighthood. She hopes that this will offer a proud and positive future to her country but, unsurprisingly, she has her detractors and when she is brutally killed at the ennobling ceremony, the kingdom turns on it's erstwhile hero. Even his boyfriend, fellow knight ""Goldenloin"" seems to be against him and so he must flee into the darkness. It is here that he is sought out by the eponymous teenage creature who determines to help him prove his innocence. Using her amazing morphing skills and both of their courage, they quickly discover that there was a conspiracy to frame him, and it goes right to the top! Can he thwart the ambitious plotting and restore some semblance of his love? It's a solid adventure story this, with plenty going on - loads of colourful and vibrant action that could well have suited Tony Curtis! The gay byline is left at just that - it's essentially an action animation peppered with some quite funny one-liners from ""Nimona"" and plenty of entertainingly compact combat scenes and shape-shifted creatures. I don't suppose there is too much jeopardy with the plot, but it was still fun-to-watch on it's limited big screen run.

jt4,3.0,"I see why this didn't get major production backing. There may be a place for the original hero in medieval times that vanquishes the monsters being female because for some reason the males who normally did that sort of thing were either unavailable or incapable; and there may be a place for a couple of primary male warrior characters being attracted to each other instead of the opposite gender despite that unlikelihood among warrior types; and there may be a place for the queen being black because maybe at some point in the hereditary line of a predominantly white society one of the royals in line for the throne married a black person, and then their child married a black person, and that just continued ever after. And there may be a place for all of that being at the forefront in the first ten minutes of the story. But because one of those on its own would be extremely unlikely and all three together would be a virtual impossibility, it just comes across to a significant portion of society as a writer or group of writers wanting to make a point, and, especially after so many attempts at this sort of ideology from Disney/Pixar and others (that have mostly been box office disappointments to the studios), it's no wonder the big studios backed off this. 

And this was even before getting to the Nimona character. After a few minutes, my son, who suggested this movie as our movie night choice, asked if we wanted to continue with it. None of us did because we really weren't interested in another 75 minutes of dealing with a rather annoying primary character. So, we only lasted 15 minutes before we turned it off, and it's too bad because the core story line of a commoner getting the chance to prove his worth and then being framed for a crime to keep him from breaking into ""the club"" is a worthwhile theme.",2024-11-18T23:11:26.738Z,961323,2 stars,0.5051378607749939

CinemaSerf,7.0,"OK, so the underlying premiss here is pretty daft. The ""Becker"" parents - Matthew Broderick and Laura Benanti are concerned that their teenage son ""Percy"" (Andrew Barth Feldman) is just a little bit shy, and so they are seeking a willing gal to help get him out of his bedroom. Meantime, ""Maddie"" (Jennifer Lawrence) is struggling to make ends meet as an Uber driver with only a pair of roller-skates to her name. She spots their ad, they meet and next thing she is chatting to the young man who volunteers at an animal sanctuary. He thinks she's weird, she thinks he's weird - but she needs a car, and that's her prize if she can get him laid! That's what works about this film: right from the double entendres of the title, it's a sex comedy that doesn't actually shy away from nudity (albeit sparing) and from the fact that the parental goal here involves their son and cherries - and not those in bowl. Lawrence is on good form and she brings out the best in Feldman who is also quite effective as the scared-of-his-own shadow young man who would rather seek the comfort of four legged friends than people. It moves along quickly, the writing is enjoyably earthy at times, there are some fun, lightly comedic scenes and though no, there isn't really a lot of jeopardy to the plot, it's surprisingly easy to watch. It also can't but elicit our own memories of being a cack-handed teenager with raging hormones that we didn't understand nor know how to control. A fun soundtrack and I found it flew by. Television will be fine, though, no need to shall out for a ticket.",2023-07-21T11:13:26.979Z,884605,3 stars,0.794416606426239
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,3.0,"There’s a sweet life lesson at the heart of “No Hard Feelings,” the supposed “raunchy comedy” from co-writer and director Gene Stupnitsky. What a shame that it’s buried under a heap of dreadfully unfunny attempts at humor, dumb pratfalls,and tired sex jokes that fall flat one hundred percent of the time. No bones about it: this is not just a really terrible comedy, it’s an awful movie all around.

Bartender Maddie (Jennifer Lawrence) just watched her car get towed from the driveway, and needs wheels, fast. While browsing the want ads, she stumbles upon an intriguing job listing: wealthy helicopter parents (Laura Benanti, Matthew Broderick) are searching for someone to “date” their introverted 19-year-old son, Percy (Andrew Barth Feldman), before he leaves for college. The pay for sleeping with their son? A used Buick. Maddie decides to take the job but in the process, she gets far more than she bargains for.

It’s a decent premise for a movie, but Lawrence is horribly miscast in the role. She’s too old to play the part of Maddie, which makes her relationship with a teenager feel a little icky. Lawrence is also called on to do a lot of comedy work and as talented as she is, she simply lacks the knack for comedic timing (she’s especially awful at physical comedy).

It’s also a problematic message to send to young men: if you haven’t slept with a woman before venturing away from home and off into adulthood, then you aren’t much of a “man.” Just think if the roles were reversed here, and it was a 32 year old man trying to force himself on a 19 year old woman so she could get “experience” before heading to college. The standard needs to be the same regardless of the sex of the main characters.

The majority of the story consists of ridiculous situations where Maddie is aggressively trying to seduce Percy, none of them funny and all of them growing old, quickly. Stupnitsky (and co-writer John Phillips) go for the lowest hanging fruit every time, and the only laughter I could muster while watching this dreck came from forced chuckles.

And that’s the major problem with the movie: everyone is trying so hard to turn it into a wacky, racy comedy that they miss the actual heart of the story.

The relationship between Maddie and Percy is somewhat charming, and the way they grow individually while together is actually heartwarming. All of that is overshadowed by the lame attempts to make it a raunchy, sexy, adult comedy. In struggling to be both, it succeeds at neither.

“No Hard Feelings” is best when it stops trying to be something it’s not.",2023-08-04T06:58:50.868Z,884605,1 star,0.5399104356765747
GenerationofSwine,1.0,"Something Something Grooming... yeah, I didn't really get that vibe from this movie.

But it was creepy that a kids parents would basically pay someone off to... doink... their son.  

unfortunately it doesn't work, Jennifer Lawrence is just a horrible person in this.  From pretty much start-to-finish she is a horrible human being, and in order for this story to work she needs to be likeable.  She needs to be relatable.  She needs to be someone that the male protagonist would actually fall for...

... and instead she's the type of person that you don't want to know.  She's not even a rougish charmer.  She's not a lovable con artist.  She's just completely unappealing.  And that is why the film doesn't work.

Andrew Barth Feldman comes across as legitimately socially awkward, but he also comes across as someone that doesn't want to be around her, and doesn't like her because of her completely toxic qualities.  

The script is at least aware enough to include that... but then does a 180 where he has to pretend that, after dealing with her, he actually wants to be around her... because the plot requires it.

For some reason he doesn't want to have sex with her because HE is awkward, not because she is awful. Which makes it a little unbelievable.  

I suppose in their effort to show that Jennifer don't need no man, they forget that they were making her into someone no one would want to be around long enough to bang.  If they wrote her as someone that at least hesitated to ruin the fun of little kids.... they could have had a win.  Instead they went for completely charmless.",2023-10-29T21:04:07.544Z,884605,2 stars,0.5071648955345154

Brent Marchant,7.0,"It’s always a pleasure to come across a film that surprises, and writer-director Gene Stupnitsky’s second feature outing does just that. When this edgy romantic comedy was released earlier in 2023, I must admit that it didn’t strike me as terribly interesting or engaging, coming across as yet another piece of starry-eyed amorous fluff (albeit a tad more suggestive than most) that could nevertheless be easily dismissed. However, in light of the picture recently earning a Golden Globe Award nomination for Jennifer Lawrence’s bawdy yet uproarious performance for best lead actress in a comedy, I decided to give it a look. And I must admit I was favorably impressed to have watched a rom-com that’s genuinely laugh-out-loud funny, full of ample unexpected moments of hilarity. This delightful, delicious cinematic nugget tells the story of a pair of wealthy, overbearing helicopter parents (Laura Benanti, Matthew Broderick) who have coddled their 19-year-old intelligent, sensitive son (Andrew Barth Feldman) into becoming a virtual social hermit. They’re concerned that, as he prepares to enter college, he’s unprepared for life in the real world, so they place an ad on Craigslist to find a woman who can help bring him out of his shell. They end up hiring an energetic, quirky yet drama-prone and financially strapped 32-year-old (Lawrence) who’s down on her luck and could use the work to help keep her from losing the home that’s been in her family for years. Thus begins an unlikely but hilarious relationship between a pair of obviously mismatched “partners.” While the film falls prey to some sappy, sentimental rom-com tropes, it successfully manages to counter those trite trappings with an array of improbable but rib-tickling surprises that enliven a genre that all too often is far too predictable for its own good. “No Hard Feelings” may not break new ground in the world of cinema, but it’s a fun way to spend a few hours stretched out on the couch in your PJs with a big bowl of popcorn, one that’s sure to put a smile on your face without having to force it and maybe leave you a little worn out from all the belly laughs.",2023-12-18T11:57:20.639Z,884605,4 stars,0.6637215614318848

garethmb,-1.0,"Finding your way in the world can be very difficult and even more so when you are a fire element with an explosive temper. In the new Pixar film ""Elemental"" audiences are introduced to Ember (Leah Lewis), a young flame being who lives with her mother and father in their combination home and business that caters to other fire beings. In a city where the various elements live and work can have its challenges, especially to the destructive nature of fire which causes some prejudice against them as well as their natural distrust of water.

Ember is preparing for the day that she will take over the family business however her inability to deal with customers leads to combustible outrage which in turn results in a flooding incident at their business. Further compounding matters is the fact that a city inspector named Wade (Mamoudou Athie), who is a water element has been sucked into the basement and promptly documents multiple violations that shut down the business.

Desperate to undo the damage, Ember strikes a deal that she will work with Wade to locate and fix the source of the leak in a few days time which will result in the removal of the infractions against the family home and business.

Along the Way, Wade and Ember start to grow close however the incompatibility of their two elements presents an obstacle as does the various elements of their respective societies.

What follows is a charming and visually appealing adventure that tugs at the heartstrings the way that the best Pixar films can.

There are multiple thematic elements at play and they're presented in a very matter-of-fact way that doesn't become overly preachy and can appeal to viewers of all age levels. Aside from the obstacles facing a mixed relationship, there are elements of finding your way in the world while trying to appease your parents, dealing with those who place limitations upon you, and finding your voice.

The characters are charming and engaging on the visuals of the world comprised of elements is often quite charming and clever. It will be very interesting to see what the future holds for the characters as there are certainly opportunities to revisit them in the future which would be very welcome as ""Elemental"" is a very charming and engaging return to form for Pixar and the perfect summer film for the entire family.",2023-06-09T17:49:10.193Z,976573,3 stars,0.5442964434623718

It features a visually stunning inter-element love story mixed with a beautiful journey of self-discovery. The outstanding world-building is once again a highlight, as are the numerous exceptionally enlightening visual details about the interaction between the different elements. Emigration, discrimination, and family ideals are some of the many essential topics addressed.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"""Ember"" and her ailing grandfather arrive in the big city where everyone is personified as one of the four natural elements. Needless to say, fire is not the most popular but they resolve to open their shop selling all things smoked, toasted, burnt, and red hot! It's an old building, though, and when one day the pipes give birth to the local, watery, buildings inspector ""Wade"" she discovers that they have no planning permission for their business and that he is going to have to report them. What now ensues is, sadly, a rather unimaginative series of escapades as she must track him down and stop him - and the authorities - from closing down the family's flaming enterprise. The animation is characterful and top notch - and the story certainly had potential, but somehow the thing just becomes a bit of a cheesy romance all too quickly. A lot more fun could have been had demonstrating just how incompatible the four - air, earth, water and fire - can be when mixed together; or - indeed - how symbiotic they can be, but the emphasis and the dialogue focusses just a bit too much on ""Ember"" and ""Wade"" and I am afraid that I rather lost interest. It's colourful and vibrant, there is some entertaining action with plenty of pyrotechnics and is worth a watch, but it will look just as good on the television and doesn't live up to the hype, sorry",2023-07-21T09:31:13.997Z,976573,3 stars,0.6258804798126221

Per Gunnar Jonsson,8.0,"This was a surprisingly good movie for being a Disney movie these days.

It is a decent story without being filled with heavy handed far left preaching.

Sure, the lefties can probably construe some message that suits them out of it and, as can be seen from the blurb, there are a message that you can exist together even if you are very different but it was not heavy handed, no preaching of certain sexual preferences or religious or political fanaticism and it is a message that I can get behind.

My girlfriend and I have both different skin tone and religion after all.

The story was good, plain and entertaining. Some adventure, action, suspense, romance and of course quite a bit of humour. It was a movie I could have let my kids watch when they were younger without having to explain the political bullshit and downright evilness of Disney’s woke script writers.

Brent Marchant,5.0,"When a drug dealer (John Boyega) in a predominantly African-American inner city neighborhood dies in a revenge killing, his friends and colleagues are stunned to find him alive and healthy the following day. That’s particularly true for two of his regular associates, a pimp (Jamie Foxx) and one of his ladies of the evening (Teyonah Parris). Together, the unlikely trio proceeds to investigate what’s going on, only to soon find themselves in the midst of a fiendish social experiment involving cloning, mind control and behavior modification targeting their entire neighborhood, a clandestine initiative operated by an evil organization headed by a bigoted mastermind (Kiefer Sutherland). As intriguing as that narrative may sound, however, the picture’s execution leaves much to be desired. For starters, the film is trying way too hard to imitate the works of writer-director Jordan Peele, with more than a few thinly veiled elements that echo “Get Out” (2017) and “Us” (2019). Then there are a number of serious technical issues, most notably the picture’s truly horrendous sound quality (generally throughout, but especially in the first 30 often-undecipherable minutes) and its needlessly dark cinematography (there’s a big difference between atmospheric and incomprehensible). To top that off, many of this release’s attempts at humor fall flat and/or lazily rely on shamelessly milking well-worn stereotypes, often verging on insulting. To its credit, “They Cloned Tyrone” does offer some valuable (if a bit overly obvious) pieces of social commentary, making the second half more watchable than the first. It also features a fine performance by Parris, who often steals scenes and leaves her co-stars in the dust. Nevertheless, writer-director Juel Taylor’s second big screen feature fails on so many fronts that the shortcomings undermine what could have been a hilarious sci-fi thriller if left in more skilled hands (like Jordan Peele, perhaps?).

The Movie Mob,7.0,"**The Flash uses the vast catalog of DC history to create an experience that celebrates the past films, highlights the good of the current DC movies, and opens the door for the future.**

The Flash reaches a high point on the roller coaster that is the inconsistent and directionless DC film universe. The story, the action, the laughs, and the cameos make The Flash a worthy cinematic debut for the Scarlet Speedster. The movie tone finds its influences more in the Marvel and Joss Whedon realm than the DC and Christopher Nolan universe, with humor overflowing in almost every scene of the movie. Despite the controversy, Miller’s Barry Allen is well done and entertaining, but the film is not great because of The Flash. It’s great because of all the outstanding fan service to long-time and committed DC fans. Ben Affleck’s Batman pummels thugs. Sasha Callie’s Supergirl unleashes her rage on evildoers. But the best part? Michael Keaton’s return to the cowl. His delight to once again portray the Caped Crusader is obvious, and that infectious joy makes the crowd eat up every scene he is in. The other DC cameos inspired plenty of applause from the theater and, I’m sure, will be entertaining for fans. Despite the nonstop humor in the film, Andy Muschietti creates some very emotional and moving moments that help give The Flash a more potent and satisfying ending. While it’s great, it is not a perfect film. The humor gets excessive in some places, and some of the character arcs end more abruptly than I would have liked, but The Flash is a fun, fresh, and entertaining superhero film that superhero fans can celebrate!",2023-06-02T04:24:18.587Z,298618,4 stars,0.5645535588264465

But the film is overwhelmingly goofy and the jokes never land properly. The film is special effects heavy and yet most shots involving an adequate amount of CGI are abysmal.

Ben Affleck and Michael Keaton look like they’re having fun, but Ezra Miller is obnoxious as the focal point of the film. There’s no sincerity in his performance even when it seems like he’s being genuine. _The Flash_ is a superhero film that prioritizes silliness with a cheese factor of gargantuan proportions, but no actual entertainment values whatsoever.

""The Flash contains excellent performances - Sasha Calle as Supergirl is mesmerizing - truly epic ""super-speed"" sequences, and countless moments of surprising humor.

The interesting, profound parallels between Barry Allen's arcs, the emotional moral dilemmas about life's scars, and the return of Danny Elfman's iconic Batman theme are some of the aspects that make this blockbuster a very satisfying, nostalgic viewing with more heart than meets the eye, despite not being able to escape the predictability of its narrative formulas.

Too bad that the visual effects are so inconsistent, and that the dependency on dreadful deepfakes is such a negatively impactful distraction. That said, it's one of the best movies from the nearly-extinguished DCEU.""

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Now I know that you are not supposed to put baby in a corner, but is a microwave ok? (Mind you, I've been on enough flights lately to find that latter idea has definite merit!). Anyway, this takes a while to get going as we are introduced to ""Barry"" (Ezra Miller) and taken through the family scenario that led his mother to be slaughtered in a burglary and to his father being charged with the murder. Desperate to save his dad from the chair and and to reincarnate mom, he decides to use his great speed to take on time itself! Despite being warned against this potentially reckless action by ""Batman"" (the most fleeting of appearances from Ben Affleck) he goes for it; gets knocked out of the timeline and finds himself face to face with - himself (only much better looking with wavy hair). This isn't the only thing that's changing on the old space-time continuum and shortly after, ""General Zod"" (Michael Shannon) arrives bent on avenging the destruction of his home world of ""Krypton"" on the people of Earth. ""Barry"" has to think on his nimble feet, and try to assemble what he can of the ""Justice League"" to combat this threat. Turns out ""Bruce Wayne"" (now Michael Keaton) has rather let himself go and ""Superman"" is being held in an impenetrable metal scrotum in Siberia. Time to galvanise and get a-rescuing before his future, all of their futures, are lost. Can they all save the world? I liked this film. It's got loads of action, plenty of pith in a script that is at the more adult (without loads of expletives) end of the spectrum and Miller has the ""P"" word. Personality. They are clearly enjoying this, and there is loads of charisma emanating from both performances from a star who bucks the normal trend of being handsome but rather wooden. Miller is the former, certainly, but they bring life to the role. It's fun, and abetted by a story that has some weight and plenty of pace to it, we are taken on a series of lightly comedic adventures that make 2 hours and 20 minutes quite literally whizz by. Sasha Calle gives us some diversion from the Ezra show as Superman's cousin - no slouch in a fight either, and Keaton does fine as he rehabilitates his disillusioned ""Batman"" character using his gadgets and gizmos to great effect. It's so much better than I was expecting and I have to say that I enjoyed the quirkiness of Miller's interpretation of ""Barry"" - nowhere near as sterile and simpering as Grant Gustin's pure as the driven snow portrayal. The multiverse can keep on inventing and reinventing scenarios and the visual effects can work wonders making just about anything possible - but without strong and personable characters then I am sure I will just bore of the relentless repetition of these stories. Miller is different. Sure, we all know of their much publicised flaws, but I hope the studio look past that and commit to a sequel that allows this actor to continue to do what they do well here - and that's to entertain us. Needs a big screen, it will look very ordinary on the telly.",2023-06-16T04:05:34.084Z,298618,4 stars,0.5853465795516968
Differ,-1.0,"_The Flash_. First announced in 2014 and released in mid-2023, it is arguably one of the worst DC movies to this date. Throughout all the problems, the most incomprehensible is certainly how Warner kept allowing such a person as Ezra Miller to be cast as the main role to be the face of a hero. With a budget of $200 million they were able to deliver the worst possible CGI ever seen, and with it a crumbled plot that wishes for more of everything but Flash. 

Michael Keaton has done a brilliant performance within this movie as a throwback to the 89's Batman. And with it, the new addition to the Justice League, Sasha Calle has done a fantastic job as Supergirl (Kara Zor-El), but both get rushed plot points that makes the audience wish for more of their screen time or even a solo movie and not the teenage nuisance that Barry Allen is. One minute, Supergirl rushes out ignoring everything, the other she's at the door regretting her decision and trying to help the rest of the characters. The same can be said about Michael Keaton's character.

The movie dives into the concept of time and its dangerous potential, later forgetting everything about it and labeling it ""multiverse"" instead, following Marvel's recent movies like _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_ and _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ and not adding a single spark of creativity with it. But those movies at least have decent scores, the music within this one must have been selected from a random kid's playlist...
The movie is also 2h 24m long, being completely unnecessary. Various scenes are completly descartable, an action scene at the start was put there with no thought whatsoever and is 15m of wasted narrative that could be used to invest in Supergirl's story (if she is here to stay). Iris West has no reason to be put into the movie. And for some reason they decided to make a bunch of cameos using CGI, and as previously said, that didn't go well.

In the end, DC is still the same mess. They can't properly build a plot and create a movie that sustains its own beliefs. Ben Affleck's Batman, at the start, said we can't change our past due to the fact that those key moments that leave scars are the moments that build our foundation and make us who we are. It seems that Barry Allen didn't learn shit from this two-hour journey.",2023-07-18T17:47:23.678Z,298618,1 star,0.47891002893447876

MovieGuys,5.0,"The Flash utilises a tried and true concept, that of time travel and its paradoxes but doesn't really deliver anything of consequence. 

This film doesn't deliver for a variety of reasons. To my mind, the foremost is the lead character. The Flash's over cooked dripiness, unfunny, goofy antics and fall flat humour, can't quite ""sell"" the concept of him as a hero. If the films producers and writers, wanted to know how to develop a more accessible lead character, they should have looked at the series. It does a much better job at balancing the characters innate nerdiness, with his other, more heroic, qualities. 

The second point of failure is essentially re-inventing elements of the story from the series and past films. Flash fans who have watched the series, may well find the film adaptation somewhat repetitive and predictable. Equally recycling large swatches of past films, with tweaks here and there, isn't doing anything that ""new"" either.

Perhaps the only real point of interest is utilising a range of past actors and characters, from the franchise, such as Batman, Superman/woman and Wonder Woman. 

In summary, not an awful film but still a little unoriginal. An outcome not helped by a rather annoying, lead character. This is balanced by decent action and the presence of other hero's from the franchise. That said, the fact its necessary to drop so many cameo's, is telling in and of, itself.",2023-07-20T00:22:02.679Z,298618,2 stars,0.6788029074668884
sizarled,10.0,"Come all, let's witness an amazing adventure of action, adventure and sci-fi in the movie ""The Flash"" which will be released on June 16, 2023 in the United States. This movie follows the story of Barry Allen, who when trying to save his family unintentionally changes the future and becomes trapped in a reality where General Zod has appeared and there are no superheroes to turn to. To save the world and return to the future he knows, Barry's only hope is to race for his life. But will the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the entire universe?

The movie is perfect for movie lovers who are looking for an exciting and suspenseful experience. The film features a talented ensemble cast led by Ezra Miller, Sasha Kali, Michael Keaton and Michael Shannon, which enhance the power of the performance and draw the viewers in with their outstanding performances.

""The Flash"" enjoys a large budget and wide public appreciation, with a cost of $ 190 million, and revenues of $ 267 million, 481 thousand and 43 dollars. This reflects the success of the film and its positive impact on the audience.

Ultimately, ""The Flash"" combines the powerful elements of action-adventure and sci-fi, while delivering a poignant story about sacrifice for the greater good. So, I invite you to watch this wonderful movie and enjoy an exceptional cinematic experience full of action and suspense.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,7.0,"“The Flash” has never been one of the most exciting superheroes (here he’s aptly self-described as the “janitor of the Justice League” who always seems to be “cleaning up bat messes”), so it should be seen as an even greater accomplishment that director Andy Muschietti‘s film is as good as it is. By placing an emphasis on the smarter and more emotional side of the story rather than the visual spectacle, the movie is thematically much richer than the customary loud and dumb summer popcorn flicks to which audiences are well-accustomed.

In this DC Extended Universe (DCEU) installment, worlds collide when Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) uses his superpowers to travel back in time with the goal of preventing a tragic event in the past. His attempt to change the timeline has consequences, as he alters the future and creates a reality where there’s no Superman (Sasha Calle‘s introduction as Supergirl is fun, but feels rushed) or Aquaman, Batman (Michael Keaton) is retired, and General Zod (Michael Shannon) has returned and is threatening to annihilate the universe. Without the help of his fellow heroes, Barry must use his wits to save the world and reset the timetable before it’s too late.

The story goes to a place that that will make every superhero fan groan: the multiverse. Don’t panic, though, co-writers Christina Hodson and Joby Harold have actually put care thoughtful care into their clever narrative, and the idea of different timelines and realities not only make sense, they aren’t wholly ridiculous or irritating. In similar films that head into the multiverse, it more often than not feels like a lazy cop-out where every death or shocking revelation can later be explained away by shouting, “Gotcha! It was only time manipulation.” Here, there are real consequences in situations where the stakes are extremely high.

Barry partnering with an alternate version of himself is a lot of fun, as is meeting DC heroes old and new. There are a lot of amusing cameos that will make fans very happy. The core of the story is a classic one, giving Barry a real motivation to go back in time to alter the past. The thought of being able to change our present by finding the ability to prevent tragedy, right wrongs, and save the people we love is one that is universal, and it works well here.

While the story is engaging, the visual effects are abysmal. The CGI is cartoonish and dark, with inarticulate motion and a dreary palette of dark grays and blues. It’s a terrible looking movie, something that is amplified during the poorly executed action sequences. Things that sound good on paper end up feeling lame, including a silly intro scene of a hospital that’s raining babies. The fight choreography and stunt work is so much better than the computer animated bits.

My favorite element of the movie is Miller’s lead performance. He’s tasked with playing an alternate version of himself, sharing the screen with a younger Barry for much of the movie. This isn’t an easy thing to do, and Miller excels at it. This is one of his best performances, and one that plays perfectly into his endearing awkwardness and bumbling charm. Despite Miller’s disturbing string of personal scandals, you’ll find he’s the best thing about the film (if you have the ability to separate the art from the artist).

I never expected to be so emotionally invested in a summer superhero movie about a character I care so little about, but “The Flash” has a sweet and touching story that’s combined with a lot of fun surprises, bursts of corny nostalgia, and a bevy of cameos that will result in audience cheers and applause. Strangely enough, it’s one of the best film in the DCEU canon.

JPV852,7.0,"There's some good stuff here and of course a good chunk was reminders of my childhood and fandome of Batman '89 and seeing Michael Keaton back in the role. The humor for the most part was fine but got a bit 'zany' at times, almost too goofy. I did enjoy the cameos which were amusing. It did touch me emotionally due to my personal issues going on right now.

That said, this didn't completely work due to, let's say, inconsistencies in quality of the previous DCEU movies, most of them I did like but can acknowledge how the studio, in its various iterations, bungled it. And in regards to to Ezra Miller, one has to separate the artist from the art which given how much of a creep he is, is difficult to do when humor is one of the keys for the character.

All in all, it was a satisfying and entertaining movie but considering that James Gunn is pretty much rebooting for a new DCU, it doesn't matter very much and I don't see myself watching again anytime soon. **3.5/5**",2023-08-23T04:01:31.457Z,298618,3 stars,0.9124757647514343
r96sk,9.0,"I fear I may be turning into some sort of DC fanboy because... I thought this was great.

Like with <em>'Shazam! Fury of the Gods'</em>, I was not expecting much from these DCEU films as I only decided to watch them so I could catch up on this universe before the <em>'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'</em> finale next month. I guess I was subconsciously anticipating these to be as flat as a pancake due to the suits upstairs focusing on the upcoming DCU. Yet, I've had a terrific time thus far - <em>'Blue Beetle'</em> pending.

As for this film itself, I'm not someone who has any interest in comic books so my only knowledge comes directly from the films. All I knew beforehand was the rather dodgy life of Ezra Miller (just look at their Wikipedia!) apparently affecting production. That's a lot of words to simply say that I have no clue how well of an adaptation this is from the comics, though simply as a film it give me entertainment, it really did.

<em>'The Flash'</em> features a strong performance from Miller, who portrays the aforementioned with quality throughout. I don't remember Barry Allen from the other DCEU flicks, so I'm pleased to have something memorable from the character with this. Elsewhere, Sasha Calle is very good as Supergirl, while Michael Keaton is much fun as Batman. There are some solid cameos in there too.

I will say that I personally would've shaved some of the run time, it does overrun ever so slighty. That is my only proper criticism though, given everything else from the story - which brings heart - to the special effects to whatever is done to a positive standard. Rating-wise, I've gone back and forth between 8/10 and 9/10 - it narrowly nabs the latter.",2023-11-19T02:00:47.388Z,298618,4 stars,0.539594829082489
The Movie Mob,8.0,"<b>Extraction 2 clearly learned some lessons from its predecessor and cranked things up to eleven, making a top-shelf action film that has me demanding more!</b>

Yes! YESsssss!!! This is what 80s action movies dreamt of being decades ago. Commando walked so Extraction 2 could soar!  The action, gunplay, grittiness, and thin plotted-ness of this movie scream 80s classic but the production quality, stub work, and cinematography are at a whole other level. The prison break sequence with the 21-minute one-shot camera move is jaw-dropping and one of the most remarkable action set pieces I have ever seen. The first Extraction was a decent movie, but Extraction 2 simplified its story and maximized what made the first one successful: the brutal action. Like the later John Wick films, Extraction 2 doubles down on being a top-notch action film, not a drama with gunplay. There is hardly any story, and the scenes that do attempt to add a little character development feel generic and bland. But thankfully, those scenes are few and far between. This movie feels like The Expendables, except with one guy, fewer jokes, and even better fight choreography! If you are a fan of explosions, combat, and scattered brain matter, look no further than Extraction 2.",2023-06-17T05:47:49.276Z,697843,4 stars,0.39387840032577515

Aside from a little of the usual woke feminist fantasy nonsense, Extraction 2 offers unrelenting, expansive action, after an initial, slow start. 

This will never be a great movie but its fun, with lots of well choreographed fight scenes, gun play and more besides. The back story is basic but serviceable and the acting from the cast is competent.

Trevor Morris,7.0,"This is the follow-up to the unexpected Netflix hit from 2020. Chris Hemsworth is back as the fearless mercenary, with more frantic-paced and spectacular action sequences.

Director Sam Hargrave returns for the sequel. The former stunt coordinator – similar to how Chad Stahelski progressed to the director's role for the John Wick series – increases the action another notch compared to the first movie.

The highlight is a 21-minute ""long take"". It has impressive choreography to make it look chaotic but it must have been very well organised, with the number of people and different weapons used throughout. There is close-quarters hand-to-hand combat, a sprawling prison-yard brawl, a decent car chase with multiple different vehicles and big crashes, and finally a sequence on a fast-moving cargo train, with helicopters and more confined fighting. Each segment would be good as a standalone action set-piece, but this is stitched together to form a high-octane breathless non-stop survival and escape sequence.

The movie boasts high production values and a storyline that humanises a lot of the characters – something a lot of ""dumb"" action movies ignore. Nothing quite compares to the first act. There is a rather clinical street shoot-out which is the least creative but does get interesting when they're stuck inside the building. The intimate face-off at the end goes against the grain of a typical action movie structure and provides a decent conclusion.

It's a fun movie to enjoy, with impressive and inventive sequences. If you like action movies, you'll love this. I am looking forward to what they can achieve in a third movie.",2023-07-11T19:23:34.049Z,697843,4 stars,0.7129485011100769

Brent Marchant,2.0,"Writer-director Wes Anderson has lost his way, and this film proves it. I realize that the auteur’s signature style of filmmaking is an acquired taste, and, to his credit, he’s made some fine pictures over the years. But this one is not among them. In fact, contrary to many of the inexplicable claims that this is his finest release, I’d contend just the opposite. It’s arguably his worst, a meandering, cryptic, unfocused piece that’s so muddled you’ll need the assistance of a search party to find your way out of it (that is, if you even care by the time the end of this overlong mess rolls around). The director appears to have become so enamored with his own eccentricity that it doesn’t even seem to matter to him whether or not viewers are on the same page as he is. Admittedly, this offering once again captures Anderson’s singularly stylish look with a stunning production design and gorgeous cinematography. But that’s all it has going for it, and that’s unfortunate given the phenomenal cast he has available to him. What’s more, despite his proficiency in creating superb visual style, he’s forgotten about pairing it with meaningful (or even interesting) substance. Its incomprehensibility and inclusion of bits that are there just for the sake of their own whimsy seriously undercut any effort to make this an intelligible work. In short, “Asteroid City” is yet another major disappointment in what is turning out to be a dreadfully dismal summer movie season. It’s likely to appeal only to diehard fans of the director (and maybe not even a lot of them this time out). If you’re on the fence about this one, consider the following two telling tipoffs: (1) when no one in the theater is laughing at what’s been billed as a comedy, that should speak volumes about it (as happened at the screening I attended); and (2) when you consider how aggressively and ubiquitously the distributors have been promoting this film in ads on TV and the internet, it’s obvious they’re trying awfully hard to peddle shabby, substandard merchandise. This is a huge waste of time and money; don’t squander yours.",2023-06-24T03:46:25.652Z,747188,2 stars,0.5163667798042297

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Well Wes Anderson has certainly assembled a formidable cast here, but I'm afraid I found the whole thing very much a case of style over substance. It all happens in an one-horse town in Nevada where a meteorite crashed aeons ago. Every year the town awards those youngsters who have achieved something especial in the field of science, so they - and their families - gather together for the awards ceremony presided over by ""Gen. Gibson"" (Jeffrey Wright). The ""Steenbeck"" family are prominent with father and acclaimed photographer ""Augie"" (Jason Schwartzman) and his geeky son ""Woodrow"" (Jake Ryan) suffering the terminal breakdown of their car that necessitates the arrival of the boy's grandfather ""Stanley"" (Tom Hanks) who arrives in his Cadillac to witness this gathering of enigmatic characters staying in tiny chalets in what looked very much like one of the demonstration villages built near nuclear testing sites. ""Augie"" takes a shine to the glamorous actress neighbour ""Midge"" (Scarlett Johansson) and his son to her daughter ""Dinah"" (Grace Edwards) and whilst these romances build in the quirkiest of fashions, we are introduced to some of the other quaint characters who inhabit the place - leaving me, unfortunately with a sort of bemused who cares sentiment. The photography is intense, intimate, intrusive almost and features more than it's share of whip pans and rolling panoramas and the dialogue is not without some pith - but I couldn't help but leave the cinema after the second viewing of this not such masterpiece cinema wondering if it were all just a case of emperor's new clothes. It wasn't that I felt that I missed something, it was that I felt that there was nothing to miss. The story - insofar as there actually was one - could hardly have been more incidental to this whimsy of a film that I would certainly agree looks great, but whose sum of the parts did not add up to much of an whole. I readily acknowledge that I don't do surreal particularly well, but for me this didn't amount to anything at all worth writing, let alone raving, about.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,4.0,"Most critics have their personal favorite directors, and it’s sometimes a challenge to keep strict objectivity when reviewing one of their projects. That’s why it pains me to write about “Asteroid City,” the sluggish, smug, exasperating new film from co-writer and director Wes Anderson. In what is unquestionably his worst film by a mile, Anderson leans too heavily on his ordered, signature visual symmetry, saturated color palate, and A-list cast while completely forgetting how to make an entertaining movie.

The film takes place in a tiny desert town (famous for their giant crater) where the Junior Stargazers and Space Cadets are holding their awards convention. The event brings together students and their parents, all oddballs in their own right, from all over the country. When a UFO is spotted, the visitors are quarantined until the government deems it safe for them to return to the real world.

The plot is thin yet confusing, as the film simultaneously depicts the events of the convention in the form of a stage play, the creation of the play, and the actual events in a retro version of 1955. With so much going on, you’d think it would be at least mildly interesting, but the movie is sluggish and packed with conversational and head-scratching filler that lends nothing to the story.

There is a wacky cast of (too many) characters, and only a handful turn out to be memorable. The expected roster of Anderson regulars make an appearance (Jason Schwartzman, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Jeffrey Wright, Scarlett Johansson) as well as big names that are new to working with the director (Bryan Cranston, Tom Hanks, Maya Hawke, Matt Dillon, Steve Carell, Liev Schreiber, Hong Chau, Jake Ryan). It’s a dream of a cast list, but this film goes to show that a talented roster doesn’t always result in a gem. There’s nothing wrong with any of the performances, but it’s the source material that needs a lot of work.

“Asteroid City” may be visually delightful, but it is filled with a detached, hipster indifference that’s off-putting. This is one of the biggest failures of the year, and it’s not because the film is “too Wes Anderson-y,” nor is it because of the general Anderson fatigue: this movie is a series of flagrant missteps that cause the project to flounder and fall.",2023-08-04T07:01:18.208Z,747188,2 stars,0.6805599927902222
badelf,8.0,"Top tongue-in-cheek directors: Wes Anderson and Wen Jiang. Asteroid City isn't my favorite Wes film, but it's surely tongue-in-cheek and pretty damn funny.

This movie reminds me a little of Tennessee Williams, the all-time master of damaged and traumatized human psyches. I see this work as a treatise on human issues, especially the labels given to us by others and those we give ourselves, and how they affect one's life and relationships.

The partial view of the ""Confessions of a Narcissist"" marquis that showed up in the background of the tet-a-tet between Augie and his almost-onstage-wife is a clue. The term ""narcissist"" didn't become popular psychology until the 1980s. There were other anachronisms, but this one is particularly striking in context.

garethmb,-1.0,"The latest in the long-running and popular Transformer series has arrived with “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts”.  Taking a cue from the recent “Bumblebee” movie,  the movie cleverly serves not only as a prequel but as a platform to introduce a series of stories leading up to the original films.

It is learned that a planet-destroying evil is fixated on obtaining a key that will allow it to travel to any point in the universe to continue its reign of destruction. The animal-based Maximals are able to escape with the key and hide it on Earth where they will also remain in secret as guardians.

Flash forward to 1994 when Noah Diaz (Anthony Ramos), following his stint in the Army is looking to find gainful employment to help his mother as well as his ailing brother.  Despite being a wizard with electronics Noah is not considered to be a team player which has hampered his job prospects and leads him to consider criminal activities in an effort to obtain much-needed funds for his brother's medical bills.

In a moment of desperation, Noah attempts to steal a loaded Porsche but finds he is unable to follow through on the act as it is against his moral compass.  Unknown to Noah the car is actually an Autobot named Mirage (Pete Davidson), who soon enlists Noah to help them find the key which they have recently detected.

This does not sit well with Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), who believes that humanity will only act in your best interests and that his crew needs to find the key so that they can return to their war-ravaged, Cybertron.

It is learned that a crafty but perpetually overlooked museum intern named Elena (Dominique Fishback), has accidentally activated the key and in doing so has allowed the evil Scourge (Peter Dinklage), and his minions to zero in on its location as he attempts to obtain the key for his master and is willing to destroy all were in his way.

Noah and Elena soon find themselves paired with their unexpected allies as they race to stop the evil from obtaining both parts of the key and find themselves with some unexpected allies in the form of the Maximals.

What follows is a frantic action-adventure film that cleverly combines humor, action, dazzling visual effects, and a tail that is part Indiana Jones, and Transformers with a surprising amount of humanity.

It would be easy for the human cast the overshadowed by the massive and visually spectacular creations that frequently transform and battle it out across numerous action sequences.  However, director Steven Caple Jr. takes advantage of his young talent both of whom are clearly potential stars in the making as they provide a grounding humanity to the film which makes it more than a lavish FX showcase.

The film also has an impressive era-specific soundtrack and a scene near the end that offers up some intriguing and exciting possibilities for the future. ""Transformers: Rise of the Beasts"" is a highly enjoyable summer action adventure as well as one the more enjoyable films in the franchise and should delight fans of the franchise and has me for the first time in a long time eagerly awaiting what comes next.

Chris Sawin,2.0,"_Transformers: Rise of the Beasts_ is a pointless entry in the live-action _Transformers_ film franchise. The Beasts Wars characters are forgettable, the attempts at humor are excruciatingly lame, Optimus Prime is a huge jerk, and the action is trash. If you were exhausted with the _Transformers_ franchise before, then _Rise of the Beasts_ will have you flatlining and succumbing to sheer and utter boredom.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"You know what - this is my favourite ""Transformers"" movie. Now that's not really saying much, most of them are pretty poor, but somehow the shamelessly derivative nature of this just made it more entertaining. It all starts with ""Optimus Primal"" (aka. ""Kingus Kongus"") having a fight with the all-consuming ""Unicron"" (narked because a typo robbed him of his chance to just be an horse with an horn) for a key that can open portals between worlds enabling the baddie to quite literally eat them and move on. The solution to that battle is a bit of a compromise and scoot forward hundreds of year and New Yorker ""Noah"" (Anthony Ramos) has a problem. His younger brother ""Kris"" (Dean Scott Vasquez) is very poorly and they cannot afford his medical bills. ""Noah"" turns to crime and that's where he encounters the newly invigorated ""Autobots"" who have realised that ""Elena"" (Dominique Fishback) - a researcher in a museum - has rediscovered the hidden key. They have to retrieve it before it falls into more malevolent hands. Soon the two hapless humans and their robots are engaged in a battle royal that sees the museum pretty much trashed before they head to Peru where they encounter the ""Maximals"" and the beautiful Inca terraces are soon for the chop too. So far I reckon we've been through loads of episodes of ""Stargate"" as well ""King Kong"" (probably the Peter Jackson one), ""The Goblet of Fire""; ""Independence Day"", ""Star Trek"" (JJ Abrams version), all four ""Indiana Jones"" films - which, to be fair are even acknowledged in the script, and the armoured eagle ""Airazor"" reminded me of a hairier version of ""Bubo"" from ""Clash of the Titans"". The visuals are excellent and for the most part it's got plenty of action but as we near the ever-so-predictable denouement the pace slackens off and cheesy sentiment brings the thing to a grinding halt a couple of times! There's no jeopardy at all, really, and given that ""Optimus Prime"" - maybe he ought to be called ""Hopeless Prime"" because he is pretty useless in a fight - gets to make his grand speech at the end, I'm sure there will be more for our intrepid young ""Noah"" to come. Big screen essential - this will look bland and repetitive on the telly. Maybe it'll help sell some toys?",2023-06-10T04:45:32.012Z,667538,4 stars,0.46914762258529663

The Movie Mob,7.0,"**Transformers: Rise of the Beasts rescues the franchise from the all-out goofy mess it had become and gives it a fun and promising new beginning.**

Transformers: Rise of the Beasts recaptures some of the fun and charm of Bumblebee and the early Transformers films and blends it with the aesthetics and nostalgia of the old 80s cartoon. Rise of the Beasts establishes some decent human leads that aren’t annoying while keeping the focus on the robot conflict. The voice cast was fantastic! Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime will always be the greatest of all time. Peter Dinklage’s Scourge sounds and looks vicious. Ron Perlman, Michelle Yeoh, Pete Davidson, and Cristo Fernández provide solid performances, giving their characters a little fun and even some heart. Rise of the Beasts reels the franchise back in from the outrageous goofiness of the Wahlberg entries but still has a good time recognizing its primary audience is kids and parents who grew up on the cartoon. The intensity and pacing of the first 2 acts are superb! The final act gets a little cheesy and starts to feel generic, but it is no worse than the climax of recent Marvel films. Rise of the Beasts isn’t perfect but it sets the Transformers back on the right path.",2023-07-16T23:24:54.990Z,667538,4 stars,0.7666163444519043
Per Gunnar Jonsson,6.0,"Quite a while since I watched the last Transformers movie. About five years. I cannot say that I had really high expectations for this one. A Transformers movie is a movie you watch almost entirely for the special effects after all.

It is an okayish movie but I have to say that I was less impressed with this one than with the previous ones.

It is clearly a movie directed to a somewhat younger audience. Still at times it was a bit cringeworthy. Especially the small “speeches” from Optimus Prime. I know it is a PG-13 movie but I think Hollywood underestimates the intelligence of young adults. But then, given the political bias Hollywood has these days maybe it is not surprising that they expect below average intelligence.

Still, there were some cool special effects, a lot of Transformer fights and such like stuff making the movie not feel like a complete waste of time.

The story is of course on the thin side and the title of the movie is misleading hyperbole. Yes, the beast Transformers are introduced but I would hardly call it “rise” . Just a few more Transformers stranded on Earth.

One thing I didn’t much like was the appearance of Optimus Prime. He looked like a has-been bum with his shabby truck and shabby appearance when not in his truck mode. Optimus Primal was much more cool.

As I wrote, overall a watchable movie but nothing really to write home about.

Oh, by they way. Remember that useless woke far left tomato site? On the page for the movie the “critical consensus” says “Thanks to some genuine human drama between the set pieces and palpable affection for the title characters, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is one of the franchise’s more enjoyable outings.” and then they put a rotten tomato side by side and claims the movie is rotten. They cannot even get their own bullshit straight .",2023-11-26T12:39:33.806Z,667538,3 stars,0.5344279408454895
r96sk,6.0,"<em>'Transformers: Rise of the Beasts'</em> continues this franchise's fine tradition of (mostly) underwhelming me, though to be honest it does match predecessor <em>'Bumblebee'</em> in at least making its plot more than just robots smashing into each other. I wouldn't file it under 'bad', to be fair.

The brotherly bond between the characters of Anthony Ramos and Dean Scott Vazquez is this movie's best element, in my opinion. I found that to be touching, even if the film doesn't utilise it as much as it perhaps could have. Aside from those, Dominique Fishback is the best of the humans.

As for the voices, Pete Davidson is good in this as Mirage - I think he might be my 'favourite' robot from this whole series. Davidson is lively in the role, amusing too. Peter Dinklage is a mini positive as well, even though I would've preferred if they didn't alter his usual voice as much.

Looks like I am going to have to now watch the <em>'G.I. Joe'</em> franchise at some point, at least that only has three flicks. Well, for now. I best be quick before they pump them out as quickly as <em>'Transformers'</em> did.",2025-01-23T16:27:04.017Z,667538,3 stars,0.5520942211151123
CinemaSerf,6.0,"I didn't know anything about this case before I saw the film, so when I saw ""Reality Winner"" and FBI - well, I was expecting a sort of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" type scenario. Nope, nothing like. That is the real name of a woman (Sydney Sweeney) who worked for the American government translating Iranian documents. She arrives home one day to find ""Garrick"" (Josh Hamilton) and ""Taylor"" (Marchánt Davis) parked on her lawn with a warrant to search her, her home, her car... She's bemused and a bit nonplussed, especially as her visitors seem way more concerned about the wellbeing of her cat and her dog! Anyway, into the house they eventually go and the interrogation begins. For a while, there is quite an effective intensity to that process and using, as it does, the original transcript of the interview as it happened, it delivers an authentic looking presentation of just how effective these agents can be. It's history, so there's no jeopardy - and I think Sweeney turns in quite a strong performance as the plot thickens but it all takes far too long to get going and the production is all just a bit too staccato. The thread does go some way to revealing the intimidatory powers of Uncle Sam when he feels aggrieved and that makes for uncomfortable watching at times. It isn't an especially memorable drama, and it doesn't need a cinema - but it will be fine to watch on the television  whilst posing a few questions about what is or is not in the ""public interest"".",2023-06-14T15:55:05.958Z,985617,3 stars,0.7335050106048584

Carwan Dourandich,6.0,"**Why Are ""Glitches"" Essential in the World of ""Truths"" and ""Interpretations""?**

> By Carwan Dourandich Originally published in Etemaad Newspaper, Issue 5591

Reality, written and directed by Tina Satter, is an American mystery-thriller film that premiered at the 73rd Berlin International Film Festival, where it was nominated for Best Film and Best Director.

The central theme of Reality revolves around the concept of a ""glitch in the system."" The director skillfully employs visual effects - more precisely, ""glitches"" - to challenge the notion of a ""perfect"" system or, in this case, to question the truthfulness of the film's narrative itself.

Satter deliberately censors essential information from the documents and dialogues in the film, forcing the audience to engage with the narrative, seeking to uncover the truth. These distortions - or ""crashes"" - are not accidental; rather, they are precisely timed and intentional disruptions that add layers of complexity to the storytelling. The presence of these visual crashes or glitches inherently directs the audience's mind toward digital errors and viruses - entities capable of infiltrating enemy systems, accessing classified data, and exploiting it for their own advantage. Within the film's framework, noise functions as a rupture between the filmmaker's simulated narrative and the real story.

The film reveals how a minor ""noise"" within the U. S. security system - Reality Winner - has caused a massive disruption, leading to unexpected events and unintended consequences within a seemingly ""perfect, flawless, uninterrupted, and well-orchestrated"" system. This small noise was so catastrophic for the government that it fostered the perception that the system was fundamentally dysfunctional. At the same time, the filmmaker subtly suggests that the successful transmission of information or truth necessitates noise - figures like Reality Winner. In other words, without noise, no precise information can exist.

To the public, the system's functionality appears as a ""mystery,"" but interference from noise unravels this enigma. In this scenario, The Intercept news agency plays the role of a mediator for the noise - acting as a noise itself within the United States. However, unlike Reality Winner, this news outlet, leveraging its media influence, is capable of shifting an object away from its conventional and seamless discourse, stripping meanings from established concepts and words, and generating new interpretations.

When, in certain parts of the film, Reality Winner - or at other times, the police officers - briefly but unnaturally disappear through a visual glitch, the audience is momentarily thrust into a void of meaning. These empty, incomprehensible spaces may signify the characters' or the narrative's loss of control, thereby challenging the viewers' assumptions about hypothetical narratives. Through these distorted visuals and manipulated narratives, the audience is propelled into the precarious realm of ""truth"" and ""interpretation.""

For me, Reality is a film about noise - noise that both exposes the gaps between the system's function and its malfunctions and, paradoxically, acts as a bridge to fill those gaps.",2025-03-28T12:51:42.899Z,985617,2 stars,0.38719648122787476
Brent Marchant,4.0,"As the son of parents who were childhood sweethearts/soul mates, I tend to be a sucker for movie romances that address this subject. In this case, however, the only “sucker” aspect applies to the money I plunked down to watch this two-hour snoozefest. Writer-director Celine Song’s debut feature has been praised as a masterful piece of filmmaking and one of the best pictures of 2023, but I heartily beg to disagree. When a pair of young, tightly knit Korean friends, Nora (Greta Lee) and Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), part ways from their native Seoul and are later reunited in New York after a 24-year separation, the reunion of these childhood pals provides them with an opportunity to reflect on what might have been. However, their time together consists mostly of a series of overly bloated pregnant pauses, inane dialogue and missed chances to discuss much of anything meaningful, the kinds of scenes that make even the most patient viewers want to yell “Get on with it already!” These “conversations” come nowhere close to matching their joy of their spirited youthful interactions or the heartfelt, substantive talks that later take place between Nora and her husband, Arthur (John Magaro). The result is, quite frankly, a big fat bore that’s trying to be more than it is but never achieves that outcome. Perhaps the biggest problem with this is the film’s truly sincere but decidedly paper thin narrative that doesn’t have the writing support to bring it all into beautiful full bloom, despite some fine performances, exquisite cinematography and an emotive background score. From this, the director would appear to have a hefty reserve of potential stashed away, at least based on this offering’s stylistic elements, but the substance could use some definite shoring up. Let’s hope her next effort lives up to that.",2023-06-10T22:14:09.873Z,666277,2 stars,0.5957798957824707
badelf,9.0,"Wow. For a director, Celine Song, just coming out of the gate, this is quite an impressive film. The lead actress, Greta Lee, fit the role like a soft leather glove, which speaks volumes, both for her talent, and for Song's casting. Lee's Hollywood Critics Association Best Actress award is well-deserved.

Song wrote an excellent screenplay, and her direction turned it into a stunning film. Kudos to A24 for taking a chance on her. I presume they are happy with the outcome. It's rather interestingly paced in a Buddhist or Asian kind of way - slow, meditative, and more is shown than is said. Overall, it's not a perfect film, but it's close.

This isn't precisely a coming-of-age movie, but the plot revolves around that (perhaps even more difficult,) developing period between the ages of 20 and mid-30s. I've held a long-standing belief that our life chapters change every seven years. You know: there are seven chakras, seven days in a week, the Seven Sisters (Pleiades), or whichever mystical seven you'd like. Over the course of three of these ""theoretical"" chapters, this movie focuses on two relationships in the protagonist's life, from roughly twenty-one (7*3) to approximately forty-two (7*6). She was married at about the time of a chapter shift (7*5), as if to validate my weird belief. In my world, it all makes sense.


This movie is certainly somewhat autobiographical, even by Song's own admission. It will be added to my Directors About Themselves list. I can't wait to see Celine's next project!",2023-08-26T04:50:20.883Z,666277,4 stars,0.6480457186698914
CinemaSerf,7.0,"""Na Young"" (Moon Seung-ah) and her best pal ""Hae Sung"" (Leem Seung-min) are pretty much joined at the hip at school. They do everything together. That is, until her family decide that they are going to emigrate to Canada. The young lad is a bit bereft, he doesn't really understand and he certainly doesn't approve! Anyway, off they go and after quite an hiatus, she discovers that he had tried to get in touch previously and so she now gets in contact. Now called ""Nora"" (and played by Greta Lee), she has married ""Arthur"" (John Magaro) and moved to NYC, but as they continue to chat online they gradually rebuild their friendship so that a visit from Korea to the USA seems the natural next step. What now ensues are a poignantly constructed series of reminiscences that extol the virtues and innocence of their childhoods but also illustrate how different they have become - even while the underlying bedrock of her relationship with him (and, for that matter with her husband) is probably just as solid - though not in quite the same way. There's a bit of pining, a bit of regret - but the film also fairly optimistically looks at where their lives have got to, and also of where their lives have yet to go. The acting isn't really much to write home about, though Magaro delivers well as the gooseberry. He doesn't speak much Korean and so the chats with their visitor frequently leave him in a sort of nervous, but polite, limbo. There are a few films around just now that focus on reconciliation of those separated by migration when South East Asia was still recovering from post war/French colonial rule - and this one is certainly one of the more interesting and honest. It's not without the odd bit of humour either - and is well worth a gander.",2023-10-22T13:44:32.405Z,666277,4 stars,0.4800363779067993
BornKnight,10.0,"An american A24 very adult romance and drama movie that gets in you little by little, slow burning with a gentle flame and involves more than just love, but personal choices and fate too.

Compared to a lot of romances this one is very real, and tells the story of two korean child, that lives closely together in their 12yo in sort of a ""proto-date"" till she emigrate to Canada and then US, already searching better changes at what she planned to do as a job (writing).

Jump 12 years later accidentally she discovers that he was looking for her, and they start to chat online together, and the old fire starts to ignite again... till the day she says with a broken heart that because neither of them can see each other too soon and because she need to focus on her work they should to stop talking for a while.

A while that passes in another 12 years and she gets on her life in America even marrying another writer aspirant while he gets a girlfriend. Then he decides to come visit her in NYC (that's shown in the very start (2min) of the movie, watch closely for the details in expressions that this tells so much) .

garethmb,-1.0,"Life as a teenager is never easy and when you are gifted with the superhuman abilities of a spider and lead a double life as a student and crime fighter; life gets even harder.

Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) is finding it even harder to hide his secret from his family who has grown concerned that his erratic behavior is more than the usual teenage angst.

In another earth, Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) deals with her Police officer father desperately hunting down her alter-ego believing that she is a killer which drives a wedge between them as Gwen desperately tries to find her way forward.

In “Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse audiences learn that what one perceives as reality is often just the corner of a much larger picture and when Miles confronts what he dismisses as a “Villain of the Week” in a quirky enemy known as The Spot (Jason Schwartzman), starts a campaign against Spider-Man, he soon finds that the threat is much larger than he expected and secretly follows a visiting Gwen into an another Earth where his actions soon draw the attention of a larger temporal Spider squad.

Motivated by his feelings for Gwen and a desire to do good, Miles looks to undo the damage that the Spot is causing across various Earths and learns that each one has its own version of Spider-man or Woman to protect it.

At this point the film goes into overdrive as Miles learns more about his past and how he became Spider-Man but also learns more about the cost that his powers enact on his life and those around him. There are plenty of special moments and guest appearances that follow from the more obscure to the mainstream and the range of emotions from the audience at the press screening as they reacted to the film showed they were deeply engaged and loving it.

The film does take a darker turn and does end in a cliffhanger which sets up the next film very well but also may be a bit darker than younger viewers might want. That being said; I enjoyed this film far more than I did the prior film. I found the animation style a bit off-putting as the jerky way the characters moved was a bit much over the length of a feature film. This time around there is a mix of animation styles throughout and at times in the same frame which may be a bit hard for some as the film does come at the viewer with waves of flashing lights, sounds, and animations that very cleverly mimic reading a comic complete with small boxes to define various characters from time to time.

The film runs nearly two and a half hours and did seem to go on a bit long at times but thanks to the great voice-acting and strong cast as well as engaging storyline I found myself eagerly looking forward to the next film.

I first saw a rough cut of a scene at Cinemacon in 2022 and it was amazing seeing the final scene near the opening of the film as it was a rare instance of a film surpassing expectations and delivers the storyline and action with a good dose of solid characters that fans will love.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Sad night tonight. After 80-odd years, this was the last film to show in my local cinema before it closed down. Doubly sad because it’s also not actually very good. The conceptualisation behind the hybrid styles of animation is spectacular and executed in an highly polished fashion - as you’d expect. The story is all over the pace though, and the proliferation of Spidey’s seemed designed more to allow the narrative to become more culturally inclusive (and bankable) rather than to develop any meaningful characterisations. What personas there are spend their time wallowing in a mire of unrequited and/or confused familial love, or teenage angst more suitable in a soap. The dialogue has it’s moments - assuming you can catch it - and there’s a bit of humour to be found but I found the audio mix made following all that was said became a bit wearisome after a first hour that really does depend on your having watched (and remembering) the first - in my view far better - instalment. This whole “multiverse” theme can keep on recycling itself ad nauseam but if the writing remains at this unremarkable level then I’m not sure I’ll be bothering with the next set of repetitively set-piece adventures for “Miles” and his parents, love interest and fellow Spider-folk.",2023-06-04T22:50:00.570Z,569094,2 stars,0.5380516052246094
Manuel São Bento,8.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.firstshowing.net/2023/review-spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-is-an-animated-work-of-art/

""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the epitome of incredibly detailed, gorgeously unique, undeniably epic animation within its medium. Separately from enjoying this movie or not, any or all cinephiles should bow to the ridiculously talented artists and animators behind this pure work of art.

That said, the attributes and issues are more or less the same as the original. The various animation styles are overwhelmingly stunning, but also to the point of creating confusing moments. Gwen Stacy stands out from the rest of the pack – both the character and Hailee Steinfeld's voice performance – but everyone on screen is impressively captivating. The voice cast is superb all-around.

An unfinished story – remember, this is the first of two parts – about what it really means to be a hero. The 140-minute runtime isn't exactly heavy, but the necessity to resort to exposition scenes is more frequent than in the previous flick, even though the narrative complexity ends up justifying this.

A must-see movie in the cinema! Go support animation.""

Chris Sawin,7.0,"And perhaps _Beyond the Spider-Verse_ will retroactively make Across’ story more enjoyable, but for now, the franchise’s flashy visuals are fully in controls of its web-shooters.

As a stand alone feature, _Across the Spider-Verse_ is groundbreaking with its half-a-dozen animation styles and plethora of Spider-Men. The Spot is an insanely cool villain, Spider-Man 2099 is an anti-hero teetering on the verge of becoming a full-time villain, and Spider-Punk oozes overall awesomeness.

But with the film sitting at 162 minutes and a sequel on the way in less than a year, the story ultimately feels like it’s stretched beyond its means.

GenerationofSwine,10.0,"I don't know, but in my humble opinion, the punk Spider-Man really needed to look like Johnny Rotten, Sid Vicious, someone from the Sex Pistols.  He sort of screamed them in the way he was depicted, right down to the multi-media used around him.

They really missed an opportunity for if not a great pop culture reference, but at least an in-joke for the punk community.  I mean, throw us a bone here.  He spent half his time mocking us anyway (in a pretty hysterical way) at least give us the laugh when they do the face reveal.

Anyway, it's not bad.  Miles is less... boring in this cartoon than he is in the comics where he's developed the moniker ""Mild Morales.""  He actually has more depth of character here and is forced to face some serious choices and turning points (Hey Marvel, you could learn a lesson here).  

But he also took a bit of a back seat to Stacey, who seemed to be the star of the show until there was an abrupt switch... which irritated me.  It sort of screamed ensemble cast, but really it just shifter from one lead to the other a bit abruptly.  As far as complaints go, that's pretty bare bones.

It also gave Spidey 2099 a sort of bad spin despite being the most beloved of the 2099 line and the coolest costume design of any spider.  So for us Gen-Xers, it sort of burned.  At least I'm old enough to have been looking forward to his inclusion only to be a little disappointed.

Overall, another groundbreaking film in the franchise that only builds on everything they created in the previous film as the brilliant animation and incredible writing is used to show the audience a well-rounded story about a Spider-Man who is trying to find his place in the world, with the only major drawback of the movie being that it suffers from the flaws of it being one of two parts.",2023-07-01T15:29:57.366Z,569094,4 stars,0.7034425139427185
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,9.0,"I don’t have that much to say about “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”, the sequel to the equally terrific 2018 Oscar winning film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” except that it’s easily one of the best films of the year. It’s the type of achievement in animation that’s not only artistically skilled but also wildly entertaining. This is one of the most perfect pieces of animated cinema in years and even better, it’s aimed squarely at more sophisticated audiences of older kids, teens, and adults.

Miles Morales (voice of Shameik Moore) is back for part two, and he’s happily fulfilling his duties as Brooklyn’s friendly neighborhood superhero. Miles finds himself joining forces with Gwen Stacy (voice of Hailee Steinfeld) and a new team of elite Spider heroes (featuring the voices of Jake Johnson, Karan Soni, Issa Rae, and others) from across the multiverse as they work together to fight off a powerful villain.

The plot is complex, but the story is terrific. The parallel universes at play don’t feel like a gimmick, and there are real stakes for every character. There are strong messages about teamwork, friendship, power, and responsibility, and it’s nice to see more female representation in a film that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. The story is a little slow at the start, but things pick up ones Miles enters the picture. His relationship with Gwen is developed extensively here, and they’re a great onscreen duo.

The film is computer-animated, and the visuals are nothing short of masterful. The animation is vibrant, skillfully executed, and absolutely stunning. This is the type of visual art that leaves your eyes begging for more. From the attention to detail to the choice of hues, there isn’t one misstep to be found.

The story, however, has a few stumbles, and most of that stems from the overly long run time (2 hours, 20 minutes), the too-insider Easter egg references for diehard comic fans, and the irritating cliffhanger ending that is so obnoxious that it almost ruins everything that came before. Thank goodness the rest of the movie is so much fun.

“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” is the type of film that proves animation isn’t just for kids, and it’s certainly not a throwaway medium that deserves to be dismissed. It’s an action-packed, visually dazzling, frentic, and outrageously fun piece of cinema. Go see it.

r96sk,8.0,"<em>'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse'</em> surpasses the original for me, though there's more to that statement than meets the eye. I watched the first film four years ago (almost to the day, weirdly) and remember enjoying but feeling a little nonplussed by it.

I think the main reason for that is that I don't have any connection or knowledge to the comics and/or the general world of these characters, therefore last time out it was a barrage of information and characters; not much of which stuck. So it makes sense why I only mildly like it.

This time, however, I did have a fair amount of fun. I had more of an interest in the characters that carried over from the 2018 flick, while the new additions worked for me too. The story does feel more conventional than previously, which is a plus to me given the aforementioned.

Other prior drawbacks were the characters of Kingpin, Green Goblin and Prowler; their designs and voices failed to hook me. Here, I did appreciate the characters away from the leads. The Spot, Hobie and Miguel are onscreen peeps that I will remember with fine fondness.

Speaking of Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld, I enjoyed both. Another aspect I enjoyed was the music and, of course, the animation. I actually found myself feeling kinda hyped by the ending too, which is a positive sign for <em>'Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse'</em>.",2025-03-04T01:44:35.785Z,569094,4 stars,0.581118106842041

""The Boogeyman quickly becomes one of my favorite horror flicks of this year! It won't leave any viewers used to these formulaic stories surprised, but director Rob Savage tremendously elevates a film that would otherwise fall into oblivion once the end credits started rolling.

Creative, clever build-ups for truly suspenseful sequences, as well as efficient jumpscares that I haven't experienced in a long time. But the cast is essential to the success of this movie. I've no words to describe how impressive Sophie Thatcher, Chris Messina, and Vivien Lyra Blair (11 years old!) are. Absolutely outstanding performances!

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Oh well, I suppose I was being overly optimistic in expecting anything different from this. The ""Harper"" family are still grieving after the death of the wife/mother and with each struggling to deal with this aftermath the father (Chris Messina), elder daughter ""Sadie"" (Sophie Thatcher) and the younger one ""Sawyer"" (Vivien Lyra Blair) are all just drifting along. When dad ""Will"", who is a therapist, gets a visit from ""Billings"" (the always slightly sinister looking David Dastmalchian) and then a few pots of mother's paint get spilled, it becomes clear that the eponymous creature is out to capitalise on their familial misery. Can the family realise the peril they are in in time to thwart it's evil intentions? Could the beastie do us all a favour and just come for the audience first? To be fair there are a few jump points, but otherwise this is a really dialogue heavy, family melodrama that focusses way to much on the who's neglecting/loving/hating whom and nowhere near enough on trying to create something original and/or scary. It may well be based on a Stephen King short story but that doesn't mean it has the credentials to stretch into one hundred minutes of pretty mediocre storytelling and acting. The lack of light works to a certain extent, but after a while it appears (or not) to be all that the film is relying upon to create any sense of jeopardy. I suppose the moral of the story might be: always keep a set of portable Christmas lights handy? Halloween television fodder only, sorry.",2023-06-07T09:12:05.641Z,532408,3 stars,0.48263823986053467
MovieGuys,5.0,"I've watched a couple of former cinematic takes on Stephen Kings Boogeyman novel and this is by far, the least inspiring.

The real issue lies, in what can best be described, as the treatment of the tale of the cruel, child stalking creature, that potentially lives in every  closet.

Its tone is obsessively analysing, of the dysfunctional family dynamic, to the point of neurosis. Yes, grieving families don't work too well, unsurprisingly. The less than optimistic over statement of this fact, overtakes the actual horror story. This, in turn, renders this film, too dark and too depressing, for its own good.

The results a predictable, not terribly enjoyable watch, that left this reviewer feeling a little washed out and disappointed. 

In summary, the too dark and maudlin treatment, robs this film of the glimmer of hope, that lies at the heart of any half decent, horror film.",2023-09-08T01:47:19.271Z,532408,2 stars,0.5367512702941895

I expected a bit more from Rob Savage (""The Host"" released in lockdown, and that I still need do see) but it wasn't this time. The actors are ok in their roles but nothing much there.

I still search to find another horror movie that innovates somehow, but it gets harder and harder. Basing the horror around a real character instead of fictional also didn't help at all, because all the logic you can make of how defeating it (that isn't so hard) is lost in the way...oh and yeah it left a little of the closet door open for a sequence.

Its quite watchable, there's a lot of serviceable action. That' said, its hard to overlook the predictable marketing of US/UK exceptionalism as ""A-OK"". Sorry but as far as this viewers concerned, it's anything but ""OK"".

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,5.0,"Gerard Butler is an actor who knows his strengths and takes roles that play to them, and his charismatic lead performance is one of the best things about “Kandahar,” a military action thriller about undercover CIA operative Tom (Gerard Butler) who is stuck deep in hostile territory in Afghanistan with his translator, Mo (Navid Negahban). It’s vaguely familiar to this year’s “The Covenant” from Guy Ritchie, yet the two films are very different. Here, the two men must work together to avoid the elite special forces unit that has been tasked with hunting them down after their mission is exposed.

The plot is very by-the-book and simple, but Mitchell LaFortune’s script features thoughtful writing with a politically-minded slant. There’s a lot of conversational drama that feels draggy in parts (and a lot of it is offset by massive explosions and flashy shootouts), but the screenplay is not mindless. It’s exhausting to keep track of the roster of characters and factions and how they are working with or against each other, but the focus on the narrative is the relationship between Mo and Tom and their will to survive. Their friendship is crucial to the story, but you must suspend disbelief because there’s no way these two would develop such a close bond in such a short amount of time.

The film is well cast and features solid performances from all involved, which in turn helps create a stronger emotional bond between the audience and the characters. The stakes are high and the danger feels real, which makes every shootout affecting and tense. You’ll genuinely root for these guys to make it out alive, but getting to their final extraction point quickly becomes a dicey proposition.

Director Ric Roman Waugh, who worked with Butler on “Angel Has Fallen” and “Greenland” is perfectly acceptable behind the camera, but the too-dark cinematography and annoying overuse of shaky handheld cameras are both extremely aggravating as a viewer. The monotonous chase – shoot – repeat formula grows tiresome very quickly.

Despite its somewhat predictable story, “Kandahar” tries to tackle some sophisticated commentary about the cycle of violence and war in the Middle East. This makes it a decent (if forgettable) movie where the action scenes come with a dose of emotional weight, and not just explosions for the sake of empty entertainment.",2023-08-04T07:11:00.160Z,717930,3 stars,0.5763295292854309

BornKnight,6.0,"From the director of ""Greenland"", Ric Roman Waugh has an established style of working, this time again with Gerard Butler. This action-thriller from the starter writer Mitchell LaFortune doesn't fall far from other films of this genre that became a trend lately (the relation of black-ops agents or soldiers and the translators that follows them, many times not credited from the danger they expose themselves from).

But is is a solid movie with far distance and expansive shots of landscape, another mark of the director that used the spanish MacGregor cinematographer (The Fall) for this work, filmed in in Saudi Arabia, being the first big-budget U.S. feature to shoot in the country's Al-Ula and Jeddah.

Solid action scenes and the interesting fact of being one of the few movie's that I'd view that shows the complexity of faction in the region, between Taliban, ISISK, Warlord and even the Iranian and Paquistan on the frontier.

She races to his rescue and leaves him to his people on the beach - both are already in love!

A combination of magic, duplicity and serendipity plays it's hand now and she ends up close to the prince, having adventures with him and falling even deeper in love - but can she get her kiss? Will the wicked ""Ursula"" let her? First things first - this isn't a patch on the 1989 version. It has a clunky, over-produced, musical theatre feel to it that consists of mediocre acting and some serious over-scoring. The delicacy and charm of the characterisations and songs has been subjected to grand orchestrations and whilst Bailey can certainly sing, the delivery is more about her ability to belt out the songs rather to than imbue them with any emotions relevant to the charm of the story. McCarthy is quite effective - if only she would stay still for five seconds and that leads to the other disappointment with this film. It works perfectly as an animation - why introduce elements of live-action to it? Neither the story nor the film benefit from the cluttering mix of CGI and real visuals. As with the recent remake of ""The Lion King"", the song lyrics, for reasons that don't seem clear to me, have been reworked - this time by the always over-rated Lin-Manuel Miranda whose ""Scuttlebutt"" song is just plain annoying. It wasn't broke - why fix it? At times there is a little engaging chemistry between Bailey and Hauer-King, but for the most part this is an unnecessary, and overly long, rehash of a fairy tale that seems to me to have been made because it could be, not because it should have been.

Manuel São Bento,8.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.firstshowing.net/2023/review-rob-marshalls-the-little-mermaid-enriches-the-original/

""The Little Mermaid enriches virtually every narrative aspect compared to the original, deepening Ariel and Eric's arcs while exploring the same core themes without losing any of its predecessor's essence. The relationship between the protagonists is unquestionably more complex and emotionally compelling, while the secondary characters - namely Sebastian and Scuttle - remain genuinely hilarious. Halle Bailey is VERY impressive and the cast accompanies her excellently.

However, it's not without its problems: the new songs are, for the most part, forgettable; the visuals are better than anticipated, but the feeling of being surrounded by fake walls never quite disappears; and Ursula was left with unexplored potential.

That said, it's one of Disney's best live-action remakes of recent times and deserves to be seen by every child in the world in need of some inspiration - as we once were.""

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,6.0,"When they get the notion to remake an animated classic into a live action film, Disney is a well-oiled machine. They’ve found varying degrees of success and failure (“The Lion King,” “Cinderella,” “Pinocchio”) along the way, and their latest cartoon-to-real-life adventure “The Little Mermaid” lands somewhere on the better-than-average scale. There are things that work (a scene-stealing Melissa McCarthy as Ursula the Sea Witch), things that don’t (a painfully lengthy run time), and things I never want to see again (the truly dreadful “Under the Sea” number), but the film’s reimagined storytelling delivers just enough magic to weather the storm overall.

The film tells the classic story of Ariel (Halle Bailey), a curious and spirited young mermaid who yearns for adventure on land. Ariel is the youngest of King Triton’s (Javier Bardem) daughters, and also the most defiant. She spends her days exploring shipwrecks and avoiding dangerous sharks (and humans) with her crustacean pal Sebastian (voice of Daveed Diggs) and her loyal fish friend, Flounder (voice of Jacob Tremblay). On her quest to find out more about the world beyond the sea, Ariel makes a deal with evil sea witch Ursula (Melissa McCarthy) to cast a spell and give her human legs in exchange for her voice. She must find true love’s kiss from the dashing Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King) within a few days or the consequences will be dire.

The film sticks to the original story, and the fairytale seems outdated. The idea of marrying a handsome prince in a few days is icky, even if it is a fantasy film. It’s interesting how much of the action feels a lot more dire in a live action setting versus in an animated film, with scary eels getting blown to bits and a shipwreck that’s set ablaze as sailors swim for their lives. The worst part of the cartoon to live action translation has to be Sebastian and Flounder, however. It’s startling to see Ariel’s buddies look like a realistic talking fish and crab, and it’s one of the most jarring and unpleasant things about the movie. It takes a lot of willpower to go with the flow, if you can get over the initial shock.

The cinematography is dark and drab (although it does look as if it’s really filmed underwater), and Rob Marshall‘s direction is barely adequate. The film is choppy, slow, and long, and its biggest failure is the uneven pacing. Some of the better parts of the story are hurried along in favor of what should be show-stopping action, but the film is so dark that it’s hard to tell what’s going on in what should be the most exciting moments. Why rush the more compelling elements of the narrative in favor for a poorly executed final battle between Ursula and our heroine? It really strips away a lot of the undersea magic.

The cast helps keep things afloat, and the performances are all solid. McCarthy is the standout with her robust turn as one of Disney’s greatest screen villains, and Diggs breathes a fresh, new life into loyal crab Sebastian. Casting Awkwafina as the voice of know-it-all seagull Scuttle is inspired, and she creates an updated version of the character that’s the perfect fit for the film. Perhaps the greatest strength comes from the irresistible chemistry between Hauer-King and Bailey, two actors who comfortably step into their lead roles with plenty of charm. She makes a great Ariel, finding a terrific balance of innocence, curiosity, and stubbornness, and he is the perfect non-threatening Prince Charming that is the stuff of many young girls’ dreams.

The biggest thing the film does right is keeping the original arrangements of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman’s most beloved songs (the updated verses, which removed some problematic and antiquated lyrics, are done well and hardly noticeable). Cherished ballads like “Part of Your World” and “Kiss the Girl” have a stirring emotional power that immediately helps audience form a strong connection with the material, even if the movie is just so/so. The soundtrack probably makes the movie seem a lot better than it actually is. The new tunes, including a kid-friendly number called “The Scuttlebutt” (featuring lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda), sound too contemporary to really fit in, but they’re fun and bring a bit of spirited pep when the film becomes draggy.

“The Little Mermaid” isn’t a great movie, but it’s one of the better Disney live action remakes because it stays true to the source material. There’s just enough magic, adventure, and romance to make this a satisfying experience for the whole family.",2023-08-04T07:16:20.960Z,447277,4 stars,0.4633561074733734

I'd personally even put it on the same level as the 1989 animated movie, though admittedly I am not someone with any sort of connection to that original flick. Halle Bailey makes for a good Ariel. Daveed Diggs, Javier Bardem and Melissa McCarthy are solid in their respective roles, I'm not wholly convinced by the latter as Ursula but she is still a decent watch. Awkwafina as Scuttle is probably the character I enjoyed most.

Visually things look nice, I like both the underwater and on firmer ground stuff. Musically it's as good as you'd probably expect, ""Under the Sea"" and, of course, Ariel's songs are solid, while ""The Scuttlebutt"" somehow works more than it probably should. I do think the run time could've been trimmed a touch, but that's not a big deal.",2024-07-28T14:55:42.775Z,447277,4 stars,0.5476216673851013

""Fast X surprisingly pulls me back into a saga I had practically given up on. Jason Momoa is, by far, the MVP of the whole film, transforming an easily forgettable villain into a truly hilarious explosion of charm and *camp*. The cast still holds that enviable chemistry, even though Daniela Melchior and Portugal deserved more screen time.

Considering the previous entries, the energetic action actually turns out to be quite tolerable when it comes to the expected illogical insanity of the franchise - which will please viewers with less patience for absurdity. Despite an overuse of false backdrops and extremely agitated editing, the entertainment levels are well within the acceptable spectrum.

Ritesh Mohapatra,-1.0,"A vacous and imbecile action potboiler which does what it's meant to do, ""Entertain"".

Fast X is a noisy actioner which pushes the limits of inventive action set pieces but this time stays grounded compared to the space shit they tried last time. As a franchise, fast and furious has always been extremely self aware of what it intends to present , over the top, adrenaline pumping , never seen before action and Fast X delivers in that front yet again. The sheer amount of scale and production value gone into this makes this an insane film. While it entertains us throughout because of its action, having an engaging and appealing premise has always been the weakest aspect of this franchise. The story is yet again dumb and feels like an Indian tv soap where no one dies and pops up again and again. 

The cast rather than balancing the count keeps getting bigger with each iteration. The best thing the makers have done this time is to integrate Jason Mamoa as Dante and he is maniacal and psychotic. Probably the best villain in the franchise until now. He brings in the much needed wackyness to the film. Alan Ritchson joins the cast and he is brilliant. While rest of the cast remains same and their chemistry adds the elements of humour , Brie Larson's entry doesn't make any sense. Let's hope she springs in a surprise in the next 2 films. The film finishes on a cliffhanger and promises more madness in the next. However dumb it may be, the franchise will be remembered as the one which defies physics in the most realistic way possible.

Overall, if you are a fast and furious fan there's no one stopping you, but if you are not then you are missing the out on the most badass franchise coming to a close. I recommend keep your brains at home and go have a blast.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Starting off with a bit of nostalgia, this high-octane adventure sees just how ""Dom"" (Vin Diesel) et al become the targets of ""Dante"" (Jason Momoa). The most improbable of robberies from a police station followed by an even less plausible chase through the streets of Rio dragging a ten ton safe behind their cars! Now I was thinking, this is going to be rubbish. Well, it isn't actually. Though it is pretty repetitive and the story is rather episodic in delivery, it's still got just enough of a story to underpin the collection of lively set-piece car chases that trash just about every city in the world - especially Rome. The camp but deadly Momoa looks like he is having an whale of a time with his role and though the ""family"" sentiment of the whole thing starts to grate after a while, the production is high standard, the pace is relentless and the visual effects are put to good use for most of it. The rest of the cast deliver adequately enough - I could have been doing with a bit more from ""Cipher"" (Charlize Theron) and a lot less from the double act of ""Tej"" (Ludacris) and ""Roman"" (Tyrese Gibson) that got on my nerves a bit after a while. From a plot perspective, it's an introductory offer - they are setting the scene for the next one (or two) that will doubtlessly be a spectacular denouement, tinged with tragedy, that probably only leaves Nepal as a country untouched by their wrecking! It's harmless fun. It won't challenge you one little bit, the acting and writing are largely forgettable and it will slot into the library of the rest of this franchise easily enough.

I love the main cast, particularly those we've had since the beginning or thereabouts - from Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez to Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris (I'm gonna need a spin-off with those two if you're reading, Universal!) to Sung Kang and Jordana Brewster (want more of the latter, but I get it's tricky with the absence of Paul Walker; who is still missed).

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,5.0,"Writing a review for a sequel like “Fast X” feels pretty pointless. It’s the type of adrenaline-fueled blockbuster that rabid fans will eagerly shell out money to see and want to love, while snobby critics will begrudgingly watch with a chip on their shoulder combined with a predetermined disdain for whatever will unfold. I’m a big fan of the series, even when it veered away from fast cars and leaned into the street superhero action angle. Most moviegoers would expect “Fast X” to be a film that’s packed with big, loud, dumb fun. It’s big and loud (and certainly dumb), but there admittedly is a slight shortage of fun.

The plot is so stupid, but it builds on the best film of the franchise, “Fast Five.” If you don’t remember the movie, don’t worry: the first 15 minutes are a rehash of everything that happened. Even newbies will be up to speed quickly. The film focuses on Dante (Jason Momoa), a formidable foe who is fueled by revenge. He’s ready for blood, and Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his “family” are squarely in his sights. This installment takes the crew from Rome to Rio de Janeiro and beyond, with explosions, car chases, fist fights, and lots of faces from the past.

The story isn’t what most came for anyway, and the pacing slows under the weight of Diesel growling about “family” and “faith.” The jokes aren’t really funny either, and Louis Leterrier‘s direction is lacking. The threadbare writing is awful. The CGI looks shoddy. The situations our heroes are put in are so far-fetched and ridiculous that it makes Tej (Ludacris) and Roman’s (Tyrese Gibson) trip into space in “F9” seem like no big deal. In other words, there is a lot to dislike about this movie — but there’s also plenty to enjoy.

The stunt driving is absolutely spectacular, as are the majority of the action sequences. For every misstep, there’s an equally thrilling chase (like a bomb tearing through the streets of Rome). The cast mostly gives performances that are better than expected. The real MVP here is Momoa, who creates a truly terrifying character in Dante, a big screen villain for the ages. Obviously having fun with the role, Momoa completely steals and runs away with the movie. He is absolutely terrific.

The film is packed with all the fan favorite characters and a few new added for good measure (although Brie Larson as a CIA agent and Leo Abelo Perry as Dom’s son don’t bring that much to the table). Diehards will be pleased to see Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Mia (Jordana Brewster), Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), Jakob (John Cena), Han (Sung Kang), Queenie (Helen Mirren), and baddies Shaw (Jason Statham) and Cipher (Charlize Theron).

Although I’m a fan of all things “Fast and Furious,” it’s becoming increasingly difficult to overlook the fact that each film seems to become even more dependent on over-the-top silliness. “Fast X” feels like it’s headed toward the end of the road, a dead end from which the series will never return. But if you’re searching for a bit of mindless entertainment, it’s also a great way to kick off the start of the summer movie season.",2023-08-04T07:09:18.478Z,385687,2 stars,0.4573793113231659
JPV852,5.0,"I've more or less enjoyed the Fast and the Furious franchise though with each installment, the writers attempt to go further in its goofiness from the previous movie, it's becoming harder and harder to really be entertained, not to mention care one iota about these characters. I will say Jason Momoa, in whatever he was doing, was a hoot in the cold-blooded villain. And in typical ""Fast"" fashion, there are scenes that don't make a lick of sense. I found some of the action scenes to be well directed I guess by journeyman Louis Leterrier who took over from Justin Lin who left only a week into production.

Given I wasn't that big of a fan of Fate of the Furious or F9, I think I've grown out of this franchise and would be a good thing to bring it to a close. **2.5/5**",2023-08-07T02:35:29.616Z,385687,2 stars,0.522270917892456
Per Gunnar Jonsson,7.0,"This was, of course, a totally ludicrous movie devoid of any pretense of realism or intelligence when it comes to basic science and physics from the script writers. It was however, also a quite fun movie.

It is also a movie free from the usual Hollywood far left woke preaching which is, of course, a big plus.

It is a shame that there is always a bunch of trolls around giving movies like this single star reviews. I mean, come on, what the fuck did you expect? It is a movie exactly in the same style as the last movies in the franchise.

Vin Diesel is Vin Diesel which is a good thing. It is loaded with fun, totally unrealistic but fun, action. I really could have been without Roman’s and Tej’s shenanigans but for the rest I liked the characters and it was nice to see Statham in the movie.

What really made the movie though was to finally see a real, rotten to the core, megalomaniac and charismatic bad guy. Jason Momoa is doing a great job of Dante and I suspect he had quite a bit of fun when doing the role.

Of course there are a few things that drags down the movie.

Things like a 20 kiloton nuclear bomb going of a few hundred meters from the Vatican with “almost” no casualties. That is a new low on unrealism even for the Hollywood hacks.

And what bloody passenger airliner has bomb drop style cargo doors under it?

Even if they did not care about sanity or realism when making the movie there are limits. That drags down the rating as far as I am concerned.

Also, they decided to make this final (?) instalment a two part movie with a huge cliffhanger at the end of this one. I just hate cliffhangers and it makes me automatically reduce the rating.

There was absolutely know need for it. They could just have Dom & Co walk into the sunset plotting their revenge or something instead of this dumbass ending.

At least the good thing is that, unless the Hollywood hacks turns out to be even more stupid than they usually are (which would be quite a feat), part two of this movie will be all about kicking Dante’s arse.",2023-11-19T09:20:12.780Z,385687,4 stars,0.43334802985191345

Leno,6.0,"This movie is an attempt to create the new ""Inception"", and whether if you liked that movie or not is good indicative of if you will like this one.
The plot follows a detective who had his child kidnapped four years ago. He starts to work in a multi-bank roberry case and soon it gets clear the thief has hypnotic powers. Additionally, his missing daughter seems to have some relation to the case. Although the detective has some natural resistance to mind manipulation, the reality is wrapped between so many layers of illusions that it is hard to know what and who is real.
The writers do a good job in building the plot in a way it's very hard to predict the plot twists. The acting is good. I just felt the movie went too deep on the plot twists to a point that most that is shown throughout the movie has no importance. Good movie although, but I would be surprised if it becomes a movie that will forever be remembered.",2023-05-02T16:27:30.356Z,536437,3 stars,0.6479737758636475

CinemaSerf,6.0,"You know, for the first half hour of this, I thought it was just a remake of ""The Mummy"" (1999). ""Danny"" (Ben Affleck) and ""Diana"" (Alice Braga) are racing around trying to find his daughter who appears to have been kidnapped by ""Dellrayne"" (William Fichtner). The latter man is able to use his ""Imhotep"" mind-controlling powers to bend people to his will, and so can turn his friends and the mob into a baying crowd. Well what gradually unravels before us now is a rather lacklustre drama that explains that there are people amongst us known as ""hypnotics"". These beings, of varying strength, can manipulate those around them (with or without light-sabres) and it appears that his daughter could end up being their equivalent of a superhuman. Poor ""Danny"" has no idea whom he can trust or just quite what is going on, he just knows that he must ensure his child doesn't fall into their hands. This leads us, rather willingly for me by now, into the third phase of the story that really does kill any semblance of originality with our intrepid hero just one step ahead of a pursuing army of heavily armed holiday camp employees. The visual effects are adequate, but the rest of this is just derivate and the story tries to be too complicated for it's own good. It will do fine on the telly at Christmas but that's about it, I'm afraid.",2023-06-01T07:36:35.947Z,536437,2 stars,0.45957064628601074

vylmen,3.0,"Ironically, these tale about a mother and daughter, fails because the male characters have no depth. The villain is evil sure, but also extremely stupid and escaping from her first attempt to kill him in a very unbelievable and unexplained way.

The romantic tension between Cruise and the mother also doesn't work and the age old friendship with Jons is also not given any backstory. I'm enclined to blame the casting here. Well, the story was lacking and oddly edited as well, but it may be because there wasn't much to work with. Either way, it's clear this is supposed to be about a mother/daughter relationship, but also be an action move and the director / writers / actors couldn't make it work. 3/10, 2 points cause I've seen worse, not because I can find something positive in it.",2023-05-13T19:21:00.124Z,552688,3 stars,0.6555597186088562
The Movie Mob,6.0,"**The Mother is an average straight-to-stream action thriller that does a decent job but won’t last too long in your memory or heart.**

The Mother is a generic assassin turned parent protecting/avenging their child from a mob of drug runners/arms dealers. While in the vein of films like Taken or Peppermint, The Mother makes a critical error the other films didn’t - a 2-hour runtime. Its bigger budget made this movie feel slightly more polished, but stretching its meager story 30 minutes longer than many in this subgenre took its toll. The pacing dragged along between the action sequences, sometimes leaving the movie feeling too long and tedious. The production quality of the action set pieces was decent, but the action itself was fairly basic. Jennifer Lopez is fun as the intense and withdrawn mother assassin and undoubtedly is the best part of the movie. The Mother is nowhere near an awful film, and reviews that say otherwise probably set their expectations too high. It's a run-of-the-mill action streamer that gets the job done, blows some stuff up, shoots some bad guys, and despite being forgettable, didn’t feel like a total waste of time.",2023-05-19T22:50:21.568Z,552688,3 stars,0.7250217795372009

The first thing, is surprisingly engaging acting, from Jennifer Lopez. I'd always associated her with music, although I was aware of her forays into acting, over the years. Lopez hands in an above average performance as a assassin, with mothering instincts. 

Lopez's chemistry with Lucy Paez, who plays her her daughter, really binds this film together and elevates it, beyond its otherwise pedestrian credentials. 

Action wise, there's a lot on offer too but its also rather forgettable.

Our faith in the Marvel Cinematic Universe waned throughout Phase 4 with films that felt hollow, rushed, and insincere. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 rekindled my hope as James Gunn and the cast’s love and passion for these characters shined in every moment of this beautiful, heartfelt send-off. Gunn reminded us of the magic of comic book movies when the storyteller cares more about the characters than the box office. Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, and the rest of the cast pour themselves into entertaining and genuine performances. This film is surprisingly emotional and had me wondering how they convinced me to care so deeply about such a zany group of goofballs, but that they did. Vol. 3 is one of the best conclusions to a film trilogy that had me leave the theater full of satisfaction and nostalgia. While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is wonderful in nearly every way, if I had a complaint, it would be the soundtrack felt forced at times rather than complimenting strong moments in the first film. The villain wasn’t exceptional but was better than the average Marvel villain, and honestly, Vol. 3 wasn’t about the villain or battles as much as it was a farewell to a family of heroes we have all come to love. This movie is well worth your time, and the fantastic effects and cinematography warrant a trip to the cinema to enjoy it to its fullest! MCU doubters need to set aside their skepticism and enjoy saying goodbye to these beloved characters with this outstanding film.",2023-05-06T01:31:27.138Z,447365,5 stars,0.571688711643219

CinemaSerf,6.0,"What a disappointment! The first one was great fun, the second almost as good , but this film is just a poor cousin that really struggles from a weak storyline that never really gets going. The megalomaniacal ""High Evolutionary"" (Chikwudi Iwuji) has set his sights on retrieving ""Rocket"" after having discovered that our feisty raccoon is a product of sophisticated genetic engineering - and that has enabled him to think and grow as a being; a skill that is hugely valuable to this global-scale cloner. Snag is, ""Rocket"" has been laid low after a rather violent visit from ""Warlock"" (Will Poulter) who is working with his mother to apprehend our ursine pal. ""Quill"" (Chris Pratt) and the others have determined to save him, though, and are soon on the trail of his origins and of a special pass key that could reset him and get him back to fighting fitness. Can the ""Guardians"" put aside their petty differences and unite before it's all too late? This is far too long and it also tries to involve all of the characters in such a fashion as to leave the whole thing with a rather superficial feel to it. Pratt actually features quite sparingly, and that robbed this of much of it's humour and punchiness. The visual effects are great, but that's nothing remarkable with Marvel - they are vivid and colourful but that's no substitute for a well written and characterful narrative that this film simply lacks. It does quite feature quite an engagingly eclectic soundtrack, but the rest of this is terribly unremarkable fayre that I found my self struggling to stay interested in as it meandered more into a realm of sci-fi sentimentality that ensured a minimum of jeopardy in a denouement that featured a fair degree of ham - especially from Iwuji. If this is to be the final instalment, then I fear it will not be one that I will ever bother to watch again. Pity.",2023-05-08T11:16:28.062Z,447365,2 stars,0.7045233845710754

Per Gunnar Jonsson,7.0,"I did indeed enjoy this movie but I have to say that I would have enjoyed it even more if it had not been such a comedy superhero movie.

It is full of silly, cringeworthy and, as usual with Hollywood nowadays, not very intelligent attempts at humor. Slapstick at best and mostly just annoying. Certainly not very funny a lot of the time. Sure occasionally I did laugh but that was about one out of three times.

And do not get me started about Quill. He’s a stupid, unfunny jerk. He so drags down these movies.

The movie does deliver when it comes to one very important aspect of superhero movies though and this is of course the action and special effects. I really liked them and most of my enjoyment of this movie came from this.

The story is actually quite okay though and it was kind of cool to get the story about Rocket.

The bad guy, well, he is really one of the best parts of this movie. Finally they managed to put together a real bonafide, megalomaniac, psychopathic and genocidal bad guy with lots of (bad) charisma.

Even if he, despite being a genius in creating all kinds of biological creations, including new species, could not fix his own face instead of wearing a silly latex mask. Seriously? That just the usual dumbass Hollywood script writing.

Overall though, this was a fun, special effects loaded, action roller coaster and, surprisingly enough when it comes to Marvel, not loaded with woke preaching.

And it was cool to see Sylvester Stallone again even if it was just briefly.

If they had toned down the silliness, or gotten someone intelligent to write the jokes, it would have gotten another star from me.",2023-10-22T15:31:21.366Z,447365,2 stars,0.44823798537254333

<em>'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3'</em> is my favourite of the trilogy, it's easily top ten from the MCU as a whole too. There's a ridiculous amount of heart placed in throughout, none more so than with a certain Rocket Racoon; those early scenes are so well done visually. Plenty of seriousness doesn't stop the humour though, of which there is - as one would expect - plenty... that carrot face gag actually got me most.

The cast/characters are such a ragtag team, on paper I don't actually think they all fit together perfectly but in actuality it is a great bunch to follow. As for newcomers elsewhere in the film, Chukwudi Iwuji puts in a strong showing; I enjoyed him in <em>'Peacemaker'</em> so good to see him further here.

tmdb51616167,9.0,"Guardians of the Galaxy has solidified itself as an incredible franchise within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Volume 1: The creation of these characters injected suspense, excitement, and a generous dose of over-the-top comedy into the MCU. Chris Pratt's portrayal of Star-Lord was a fantastic choice, and the characters like Rocket and Groot became instant fan favorites, with merchandise flying off the shelves. While Nebula's transformation from antihero to hero was well-received, Gamora felt underutilized. Drax provided comic relief, but off-screen controversies involving the actor can affect viewers' perception of the character. Overall, the movie is enjoyable and worth watching.

Volume 2: While some may prefer the first installment, Volume 2 offers a deeper dive into the characters and more excitement. The film is wonderfully executed, providing a fantastic adventure that is highly recommended for its magical space journey and character development.

Volume 3: This installment returns to the original concept of Marvel, seamlessly connecting with other films in the MCU. The movie offers fantastic character development, ensuring each character shines without overshadowing the others. Star-Lord and Gamora remain central, but the film also explores Rocket's origin story exceptionally well. The ensemble cast, including Mantis, Nebula, Groot, and Drax, deliver standout performances. New additions like Cosmo and Blurp add charm, while Adam Warlock's portrayal, though slightly disappointing, is explained within the storyline. The film is emotional, with impactful end credit scenes, making it a must-watch in theaters.

Holiday Special: The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special is an exciting and enjoyable addition to the franchise, offering a fun and engaging viewing experience.

Mister BLAQK,7.0,"This might be one of the most uplifting endings to a Marvel movie so far, every main character got a lovely send-off. I was amazed by how Gamora was handled as well, and I admired that they didn’t rekindle Quill and Gamora’s relationship. Ultimately the film was about found family, and it never veered off course.

High Evolutionary is by far one of the best MCU villains. No jokes, No quips dude is unrelenting and detestable. ""There is no god, that's why I stepped up!"", was such a great line. Chukwudi Iwuji knocked it out of the park.

I didn’t expect much coming in, and didn’t even watch any trailers, but ended up with so many happy tears.

Fully expected Drax to die but I’m pleasantly surprised that my expectations were subverted and that his ending was not tragic at all.

r96sk,6.0,"Neither good or bad, <em>'Peter Pan & Wendy'</em> is rather average.

Peter Pan is admittedly a tale that, even as a kid, I never really clicked with. The two Disney animated flicks are films I'd consider as good, but even then I didn't really vibe with them all that much. I think it's because I find the story quite one-dimensional, there's never anything that I can sink my teeth into.

I do, though, like how this version mixes a few things up, particularly with Hook and Pan's backstory. As well as how Tinker Bell acts, I always found it a bit odd how she would be jealous of Wendy in the other pictures - her behaviour in this 2023 film does feel much more logical. So I do give credit to the filmmakers for these changes.

Those weren't enough for me to enjoy this, however. At least it's better than 1991's <em>'Hook'</em>. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",2024-07-27T12:25:27.197Z,420808,3 stars,0.7030211091041565
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,8.0,"Director Guy Ritchie is no stranger to crafting exciting action films, but his latest project is quite different than his previous work. The narrative is linear, there aren’t any montages, and the story isn’t about criminals, gangsters, or Brits. Fans of Ritchie will absolutely still recognize his visual style (hello, overhead shots) and testosterone-fueled themes, but “The Covenant” is a more dramatic, mature, and restrained work from the legendary director.

Set during the war in Afghanistan in 2018, the film tells the story of U.S. Army sergeant John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his local Afghan interpreter, Ahmed (Dar Salim). Called a traitor by his people for helping the Americans, Ahmed has volunteered to seek revenge against the Taliban that killed his son. He has also been promised visas for his service so his family can flee to safety in America. After a lethal ambush in the desert, Kinley is gravely injured by enemy fire. With his platoon gone, Ahmed refuses to leave a fellow soldier behind to die, so he drags Kinley through the mountainous terrain in order to get him back to the base for medical help.

The film tells the story of their 100 mile journey, but then pivots to Kinley’s return to the United States. It’s months after he gets home that Kinley learns Ahmed and his family were not given safe passage as promised and, as a way to repay the debt he owes his friend, he returns to Afghanistan to retrieve them. It won’t be easy, because Ahmed has been placed at the top of the Taliban’s most wanted hit list.

It’s a meaningful story of honor and brotherhood wrapped up in an intense wartime thriller. The story is told in three major acts, from the early days Ahmed and Kinley spent chasing IEDs, to their dangerous journey, to the red tape of getting a man what he’s owed. There are plenty of thrilling acting sequences throughout, and they will keep you on the edge of your seat.

Ritchie has an extraordinary sense of timing and instincts for shooting action scenes, and the brutal, graphic wartime violence puts you in the be-or-be-killed survival mind of a front line solider. The director’s visual storytelling is terrific here, as he switches between handheld shots with uneven movements to dizzying aerial shots to sweeping tracking shots seamlessly within one action scene. It creates a greater sense of immediacy and danger, expressing the gravity of the situation at hand.

Some of the scenes are so distressing that I found my heart pounding throughout, and Ritchie’s use of harsh close-ups adds to the intensity. There’s a lot of cat-and-mouse content that adds to the tension, but it doesn’t feel gimmicky because this is a film that is unafraid to kill off characters at any time (so don’t get too attached to anyone).

Gyllenhaal and Salim make a dynamic onscreen duo, and both men have a natural chemistry that is the highlight of the film. Salim’s performance is dynamic and genuine, and Gyllenhaal proves yet again that he’s a formidable leading man. He’s in his natural habitat here, playing a rugged everyman with a non-threatening masculinity that gives him a broad, universal appeal. The performances from the supporting cast are also top-notch.

The story is one of integrity, loyalty, and respect, and these men have an incredible amount of honor. Ahmed and Kinley are forced to make tough decisions, but they never shy away from doing the right thing, even when it’s the harder option. These guys are still combat killers and trained soldiers, but their friendship takes center stage. This is such a great story of brotherhood that you’ll wish it was true (sorry folks, this is a work of fiction).

The film only makes a couple of missteps, and there are two major things that bothered me. First, the alpha male dialogue among the soldiers is openly homophobic. It’s laughed off and never challenged. I found this to be a bit problematic, but the way these guys talk is also likely accurate and authentic. Second, the grand finale shootout feels a bit like military propaganda, where the brawny American saviors must step in and become the heroes. It’s a sequence that’s thrilling, but feels stuffed in as a way to appease the hyper-patriotic “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” crowd.

But here’s where it gets interesting: the film is also highly critical of the U.S. government and the heads of the military. The soldiers may have honor, but those at a higher level do not. The film offers a scathing criticism that applies to the many ways the U.S. abandons its veterans too, from dismissing allegations of sexual assault, making it difficult to obtain proper healthcare, crafting vague promises, and flat-out lying. It’s a profound theme that may be lost on the majority of audiences (but I hope not).

“The Covenant” is an extremely well made wartime action film, and those looking for a thrill will find it. Go and enjoy the entertainment value, but don’t lose sight of the small, emotional story that’s at the heart of it all.

Nathan,8.0,"After Guy Ritchie’s last film, Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre, was an absolute disaster, I seriously considered skipping his most recent outing, The Covenant. However, I'm very happy I didn't because it's become one of my favorite films of the year so far.

The direction is excellent, with amazing up-close shots and zooms that really add to the intense nature of the film. The first hour flew by with fantastic build-up and character development. The action was superb and brutally realistic, showcasing the true horrors of the War in Afghanistan in a respectable way. However, after this first act, the movie does slow down a bit, with a pretty substantial lull that lasted about 20 minutes in the middle of the film. It was not terrible, but something I definitely noticed. Performances were excellent, particularly from Dar Salim, who was a standout in the film. His grueling journey across the Afghanistan terrain was one of the most stressful and inspiring segments in any film so far this year and had me at the edge of my seat.

Overall, The Covenant is a pretty straightforward war story, told with excellent direction, performances, and visuals. It handles the source material with incredible care, showcasing the environment of Afghanistan in a way I have never seen before.

Ritesh Mohapatra,-1.0,"A staggering tale of an unhinged perseverance which is backed by a captivating screenplay.


Air is a story so frivolous and flat , that the courage of Ben Affleck should be lauded with our hats down. A simple plot which would fit within 3 lines of a page is magically presented to us as a fascinating and appealing peace of history which changed the strature of business in sports in America and revolutionized a global culture, Nike's collaboration with the greatest basketball player in the history of the game, ""Michael Jordan"". The 2 hours doesn't feel long when you have a dazzling screenplay & a marvelous ensemble cast with their pragmatic conversations. Ben Affleck really puts in a fine effort to yield such sensational performances for the star studded cast. 

Brilliant is an understatement for the ensemble cast. I have never seen a better grounded performance of Matt Damon than this. He is sensational. Jason Bateman and Viola Davis add the much needed spark with their magnetic performances. Good to see Chris Tucker back and boy he just gets his sense of humor right each time. The banters between Matt and Chris Messina is the highlight for me. Ben Affleck is a master in terms of direction, the way he manages veterans into building such a collaboration is astounding. 

Overall, If you believe in uplifting stories behind sports and redefining moments of history which changed the world we live in today then Air is a great addition to your watchlist.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Seems to be a growing trend nowadays to lead with the credentials of the director in order to get eyeballs onto a movie. That's what seems to have happened here, but once you're watching it turns out to be little better than a derivative vehicle for an unremarkable Jake Gyllenhaal who gets to tug at the heart strings on behalf of those vital interpreters (50,000 of them, apparently) who were abandoned to the Taliban when the allied forces quit Afghanistan. In this rather procedural effort, his guide ""Ahmed"" (Dar Salim) goes above and beyond to rescue his handler ""Kinley"" from ambush only to find that the American is flown home to safety, recuperation and a big steak on the barbecue. The latter man is left to reap the benefits of his sterling efforts by having a price on his head and so is forced to live in hiding. ""Kinley"" learns of this and decides that the man must be got out. After endless red tape seems determined to ensure that the promise made at the time to these folks to offer them fast-track American visas after the conflict was not going to be honoured any time soon, ""KInley"" decides he's going to have to take matters into his own hands. Remarkably, from his American home he manages to track down the elusive ""Ahmed"" and with the aid of a commercial extraction agency, funds a trip to get in and get his friend out. Aside from some serious plot plausibility issues, as action films go it's fine. The cinematography and pace work well to give us a sense of the danger and the relentlessness (and stealth) of the warfare that frequently nullifies the superior firepower of the visitors when faced with hostile terrain and efficient guerrilla warriors. Gyllenhaal does nothing for me here, though. He's just going through the motions, especially when required to actually act. He has become a rather one-dimensional performer (maybe it's the beard?) and though there is merit in Salim's performance as his character is allowed to mature a little by Guy Ritchie, I just felt that I'd seen the film before and the underpinning moralisation was largely undermined by the predictability of the storyline. It's certainly watchable, but it isn't hard to see why it never got a cinema release.",2023-06-04T06:13:53.033Z,882569,4 stars,0.4696047604084015
MovieGuys,6.0,"This strikes me as a ""feel good movie"" pitched at US audiences. It ultimately makes all the right sounds about military honour and commitment, even when confronted by stubborn bureaucracy and indifference. 

That said, its only at the end, when you read the ""fine print"", (300+ interpreters and their families dead) you get to see the scope of the US's lack of commitment to those who collaborated with it, in Afghanistan. 

I guess the obvious elephant in the living room, is should the US have invaded in the first place? Looking at the facts, the answer is, of course, ""no"". So much of the misery and loss we see on the ground in this film, probably could have been avoided, had the US stuck to its own borders. 

The film itself is well made, well acted and directed. Its story does resonate in a humanistic context. The action is well developed too if not entirely convincing. I did a wry smile at how the so called ""bad guys"", as per usual, seem to be appalling shots. Even when well armed and in large numbers, at close range.

Inn summary, well acted, directed, a heartfelt story and lots of mostly engaging action. That said, the historical reality is, the US were invaders in Afghanistan. So perhaps the underlying take away from this, is the need for an end to wasteful wars, that should not be fought.",2023-06-13T23:29:46.263Z,882569,4 stars,0.5434070825576782

Ghosted wrestles with its tone as it decides whether it’s a goofy rom-com or a more serious spy thriller. While very much in the vein of Knight and Day or The Killers, Ghosted doesn’t stay committed to comedy throughout. The jokes come and go, with Chris Evans taking most of the comedy side and Ana de Armas taking most of the action. The tone might be conflicted, but the fun never stops. Solid action sequences, car chases, exotic locations, and elegant gowns and suits - Ghosted has all the essential elements of a classic spy film. The jokes land better than The Gray Man’s quips, and the action is better than Red Notice’s set pieces giving Ghosted a slight edge over its streaming adventure competition. It’s a flawed movie for certain, with an out-of-place soundtrack and identity crisis, but what it does well makes it interesting enough for a watch and possibly even a sequel. …maybe",2023-04-21T21:41:15.833Z,868759,3 stars,0.6753444671630859

Nathan,4.0,"Ghosted has been the target of internet criticism since the first scenes were published on social media, and while the film is not good, it is not nearly as bad as some make it out to be.

The direction and visuals were all fairly good. The visuals looked fine for the majority of the film with no complaints whatsoever, including Ana de Armas’ wig. The direction was good, with some decent action choreography that was filmed pretty well, although there were a few scenes that suffered from too many jump cuts. I thought the intimate scene towards the beginning of the film was very stylistic and done really well. It was not just your standard grunts and moans that you see in so many films today.

The story was very oddly paced. The beginning section was really rushed, and the romantic build-up did not feel genuine in the slightest. Due to a poor script, their chemistry was non-existent in some sections, as the dialogue was atrocious. While there are some laughs to be had for sure, the majority of the comedy did not work for me. There was heavy use of modern songs throughout the entirety of the film. While some sections were complimented by the tracks, many others felt really out of place.

The performances were decent, but I think were hindered by the poor script. Ana de Armas was fine, although I never really liked her in anything since ""Knives Out"" as her performances always seem a little dull. Chris Evans played a character he's played many times before, which was entertaining, but he could not alone save the terrible dialogue he was given.

MovieGuys,5.0,"I enjoyed The Last Kingdom. As a series it wasn't perfect but it was reasonably watchable. Then along came the movie. 

I'll separate this into good and bad. Lets start with whats bad. Unsurprisingly, more woke revisionist history. Yes, female empowerment was a big thing in Saxon times, apparently. I had no idea. I thought women were relegated to mostly domestic roles and had little say. 

Questionable scripting. The script feels rushed and jumps into the story which almost feels like the second part of a tale, that needs more of a discovery back story. For those who have not watched the series, it is probably going to be, justifiably, really confusing. 

The idiot decisions made by the lead character Uhtred, make little sense, either. Having regained his kingdom, Uhtred decides to back a royal family who, in the series, hung him out to dry.And worse still, they don't even ask nicely (but hey, female empowerment, right?). So off he blithely goes with his friends, risking everything for ungrateful, untrustworthy people, based on a promise, of sorts. Then it turns out the new King is an utter tyrant, influenced by his corrupt, gay boyfriend. As a note, homosexuality was not unheard of in Royal circles but to be this blatant, in this period of strict religiosity, at this level, would risk being dethroned, so it really doesn't ring true. Yet, Uhtred backs the King anyway. A real nobleman would and histrionically did, put distance between them and this kind of Royal behaviour. 

Suffice to say, the whole premise, stands on ""shaky legs"". 

Is there an upside? Yes, great acting in spite of a contrived story and decent Norsemen meets Saxon, swordplay action. Certainly, fight scenes were always this franchises strong point and that does not change.

In summary, let down by a weak tea, revisionist story that fails to adequately explain the primary characters inexplicable motivations (not that they really make much sense). Upside is limited. Decent acting and action scenes but really its more a consolation prize, than anything else. Watch the series instead, in this reviewers opinion, its vastly superior.",2023-04-14T23:03:47.175Z,948713,2 stars,0.5434762239456177

**Seven Kings Must Die is an adequate film but an unnecessary disruption to a great ending for a show with a rewarding resolution.**

Seven Kings Must Die is the conclusion of The Last Kingdom series. A conclusion that didn't feel necessary as the story ended with a satisfying resolution and characters we had grown to love over five seasons finding happiness and a rewarding future. Instead, this 2-hour movie is more of a finale that disrupts our story's happy ending and leaves it all with less closure than before. With the promise of a ""movie,"" I was hoping that the film would enjoy greater production quality and resources than the typical show, but that was not the case. Seven Kings Must Die was just an entire season of The Last Kingdom crammed into 2 hours. Fans of the series might enjoy seeing more of their favorite characters (although they might be disappointed with the conclusion of those characters' stories). Unfortunately, those unfamiliar with The Last Kingdom would be confused by the partial narrative they receive with this film. Seven King Must Die might have been a decent finale to an additional season of the show, but as someone who liked how the show ended, I wish I had joined my wife and gone to bed without finishing the film. The show is excellent, so watch that instead. It really isn't as bad as I am sharing, but I was happier as a fan without it, and non-fans would probably not find it worth their time, either.",2023-04-15T05:24:31.526Z,948713,3 stars,0.5150896310806274

“Beau Is Afraid is by far Ari Aster's most complex, inaccessible film to date, although guilt, extreme anxiety, and a complicated mother-son relationship are clear themes deeply explored throughout five sections - the second is one of the most mesmerizing, visually stunning sequences of the year. The more I think about what I watched, the more I admire the unique, thought-provoking, overwhelmingly surreal storytelling by one of the most authentic voices working today.

That said, the three-hour runtime feels really heavy, the analysis of the movie as a whole raises some issues, and while all the technical departments are award-worthy, stating ""it's not for everyone"" is a perfect description of one of the most divisive films you'll see for a while.”

Nathan,4.0,"Beau is Afraid certainly boasts an incredibly rich and intricate narrative, filled with a plethora of allegories, symbolisms, and thematic elements. However, one may question whether the complexity of the film is worth sacrificing entertainment value. In attempting to weave together these complex themes, Ari Aster has created a narrative that was very difficult for me to fully process.

During the first hour of the movie, I found myself engrossed in the story, with tense scenes that blurred the lines between what is real and what is fake. However, as the film progressed, these surreal scenes became increasingly wild and disjointed, leaving me feeling disconnected from the narrative. I found myself constantly asking questions about what was happening, how we got there, and why things were unfolding the way they were. This detachment ultimately detracted from my overall enjoyment of the film.

At three hours in length, Beau is Afraid can be a daunting task for audiences to undertake. While a well-paced film can fly by (Avatar: The Way of Water and Babylon for instance), this one felt like a slog at times, and I found myself frequently checking the clock to see how much time was left. However, despite these shortcomings, the technical execution of the film was truly exceptional. Aster's direction was brilliant, with stunning camera work and beautiful cinematography. The acting was also top-notch, with Joaquin Phoenix delivering what was arguably the best performance of the year so far. The supporting cast, including Amy Ryan, Patti LuPone, and Nathan Lane, also gave standout performances.

All in all, Beau is Afraid was quite a letdown for me. While Aster undoubtedly has a brilliant mind and a talent for storytelling, this film may have suffered from a lack of restraint. Nonetheless, the technical prowess and stellar performances are certainly noteworthy and should not be overlooked.

It's after one such a lively night that he suddenly awakes realising that he must get to the airport to go and visit his wealthy mother. Suffice to say, events conspire and he doesn't quite make the trip... He calls to alert his mother only to get the UPS man on the phone standing over an headless corpse. His mother? Well he now has to make a journey - without a functioning credit card - in time for her funeral. What now ensue are a series of mildly entertaining but largely just too surreal escapades that marry fantasy and fiction on his trip. This is a very strong effort from Joaquin Phoenix as the gentle but almost permanently bamboozled ""Beau"". He gives himself fully to the part and engenders frustration and sympathy successfully as the story progresses - in fits and starts - towards it's conclusion. Nathan Lane chips in well - if completely over the top - too, as surgeon ""Roger"" and we save the best til last with a rather bizarre denouement that sees Patti LuPone (his mother, ""Mona"") in an whole new light. At times the writing can be witty but for me this is just way, way too long and episodic. It's as if Ari Aster had an accumulation of ideas for his character that he has, almost ""Forrest Gump"" style, stitched together in the hope that what emerges at the end has been enjoyable to watch. I'm not great at the outlandish. It's not that it needs a solid beginning, middle and end but somehow I prefer the plot to be rooted in something just a bit more tangible than this is. I am glad that I saw it in a cinema, but I can safely say I won't watch it again.",2023-05-21T08:10:17.983Z,798286,4 stars,0.459966778755188

The production values are very high and the look and feel of the movie are very rich... but it's not enough to hold the three hours together.

Beau is the unluckiest person ever... and he is constantly jumping from the frying pan into the fire (and through no fault of his own). This becomes incredibly tedious.

Horseface,10.0,"Zero spoilers in here. 

Absolutely wonderful. I can't do a big braining on what everything means in this crazy topsy-turvy roller-coaster of a movie, but it's one hell of an entertaining ride if you just sit back and enjoy it. For me, this movie needed to be watched the same way I watched Lost Highway - don't try to understand it, just be open to being frightened and entertained. 

Suffering from generalized anxiety myself, the first part of the movie is absolutely brilliant, showing the world through the lens of someone with a severe case of anxiety. Everything is over the top, and the attention to detail is stunning.

The movie devolves further and further into madness, somewhat akin to the way it did in Mother, except not in a frustrating way, but rather an action-packed and crazy, sometimes touching way. Oh, and hilarious. There are such funny moments in this movie, often absurdly so.

I didn't read up on anything before watching this movie, and I had no idea it was going to be three hours. I didn't know Ari Aster made it, and frankly I didn't know who he was. Looking it up afterwards, I see he made Midsommar, which I found tedious and boring, and Hereditary, which I absolutely loved.

I can definitely see how someone could hate this movie. I can also sympathize with being frustrated with it if trying to understand everything. I think the best way to watch this is popcorn. Watch this like you'd watch a popcorn flick, except expect absurdities instead of explosions (though we do get explosions here, too). That's how you'll be entertained by this amazing movie. I'll be watching this again.

Oh, and Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for this performance. Absolutely his most impressive performance so far.

BornKnight,8.0,"Not for everyone indeed. But it is A24 and Ari Aster (and yeah I am a fan of his works). It is very difficult to categorize the movie... part thriller, part abstract, part (well mostly) dark comedy. 

Who knows Ari Aster works of before (Hereditary, Midsommar) knows he likes a lot to put abstract, symbolic and allegorical scenes, and pieces of the plot hidden thorough the movie. Beau Wasserman is unique and pitiless. 

This one is surely one he put a hell of an effort to put things, and make sense in the senseless... and in chaos that is a definition for what I saw, it is pretty crazy as some flicks from the 70's (see Holy Mountain of 73, or Zardoz of 74 and you will get the LSD level of the scenes). Some more recent movies had that WTF moments too, like the middle part of Triangle of Sadness or some parts of White Noise (both of 2022) and you get the level of non-sense and comic all together.

The best definition of the Kafkaesqueness of Beau is to pick some work of the dutch painting Hieronymus Bosch of the XV century and try to grab some meaning on it. It is there but not so obvious.

In the case of Beau you can see two things: 1-) he is clearly someone with deeply psychological or psychiatric issues and 2-) he has a deep anxiety and FEAR all along the movie in the hope to not let people down or not to be a disappointment to anybody even he is clearly being it already in his mind. It is on the title of the movie.

The most ""normal"" scenes in the movie are the ones in the start of the movie in the psychiatrist bed (the ones that he must have with lot's of water - I don't know if it is a joke or not but Wass in german means ""water"" and element that is present since the beginning of the movie). 

It must be interesting to see Aster working in his works, because neither one is simple, all are complex and relates to parts that we seen before. His passion for his work makes him one of the directors I admire at the most. Some people don't like him - the same way some people don't like Lars von Trier works. It is a matter of taste, and it is totally normal.

For me the story told is all above - don't try to pick what is real and what isn't, because out of the clinic door all is in Beau's head. Fragments of reality and inner issues in a bizarre blender that isn't for everyone.

I wish I had seen it on the theater there were some scenes that made me laugh a lot and at the same time felt guilty like the one at his attic. 

On the technical side: Joaquin Phoenix again is a powerhouse in acting (and Academy worthy maybe?), the script is pretty original (well, last year Everything Everywhere All at Once was mostly non-sense but with a sense and won tons of stuff) and the work on editing and art direction are excellent and again long colaborator Pawel Pogorzelski work as cinematography is impeccable.

I liked the movie, it isn't the best of Ari Aster (and three hours are heavy on most of the cases), but is pretty good: my score is 8,3 out of 10,0 / A -.",2023-11-17T02:56:58.783Z,798286,2 stars,0.4063594341278076
garethmb,-1.0,"Evil Dead Rise Gives Series Fans A Fresh Take And Plenty Of Gore
Usually when a film series is embarking on a fifth outing the challenges
of keeping things fresh and original yet being new and creative can be a
massive obstacle.

Horror series ranging  from “Halloween” to “Friday the 13th”, “SAW”, and
“A Nightmare on Elm Street” all faced issues with moving the series along
yet trying to stay true to the original film that inspired them and in
every case; failing to fully capture what made the original film a hit.

“Evil Dead Rise” is not only the latest entry into the series but a bold
take on the cinematic series as it abandons the remote cabin setting of
the first two films and the reboot in favor of an urban setting.

The film does open in a remote lakeside locale before jumping a day
earlier to California where estranged sisters Ellie (Alyssa Sutherland)
and Beth (Lilly Sullivan) reunite. Beth has been working as a guitar
technician and bristles that her sister refers to her as a groupie.

Ellie is raising three children after their father left and informs her
sister that the building they are living in is scheduled to be demolished
so they will have to move soon which is a shock to Beth as she has learned
that she is pregnant and is trying to figure out her life all the while
seeing what she thought would be a source of stability for her upended.

The arrival of an earthquake allows access to a hidden area in the parking
garage of their building and since the locale was a former bank; the kids
soon find a hidden book and records which the only son Danny (Morgan
Davies) hopes he can sell despite his sister Bridget (Gabrielle Echols)
admonishing him constantly to leave it alone and return it to where it was
found.

The book turns out to be a Necronomicon or “Book of the Dead” and as fans
of the series know; nothing good ever comes from one and thanks to playing
old records left by a Priest describing his thoughts on the book; a
summoning incantation is read and this causes Ellie to become possessed
and unleash grotesque carnage and terror on her family.

What follows is a gory and at times intense game of cat and mouse
punctuated by moments of levity as the demonic infestation knows no end.

The film has the over-the top- gore that is expected of the series and the
makeup and effects are very effective. Writer? Director Lee Cronin has done
a great job capturing the tone of the series while moving it forward as he
cleverly incorporates lines and nods to the series without making them
seem forced.

Some may find the excess of blood too much but the series has always been
known for taking things to the extreme as the blend of horror and comedic
parody is what made the original film such a success.

In the end “Evil Dead Rise” does enough to keep fans of the series happy
and hopefully, we will be seeing a new entry in the series in the future.

Chris Sawin,7.0,"_Evil Dead Rise_ is mostly entertaining as a new entry of the _Evil Dead_ franchise, but it’s got some hiccups that should be ironed out in any potential sequel.

The cast’s performances are all strong, with Sutherland masterfully making the most of her character with spine-tingling body language and unnerving dialogue, but as a fifth film in a well-known horror franchise, it’s disappointing to see that its most memorable moments are throwbacks to previous films.

Ultimately, _Evil Dead Rise_’s biggest flaw is that it simply isn’t as good as its ten-year-old predecessor. Nevertheless, the film is fun, blood splattering carnage that will hopefully take the _Evil Dead_ franchise in a bold and exhilarating direction.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"This is certainly a triumph for the visual and audio effects folks. Otherwise, I found it all a bit derivative and frankly a rather classless rehash of the much more entertaining original. It's tough to just keep on re-inventing these themes - they do tire, and as I reckon with the recent updates of the ""Halloween"" franchise, they maybe just rely too heavily on a current generation who were not around to see the originals in the cinema first time round, and who maybe just don't appreciate that the acting and the writing - though never exactly crucial to these plots - did have more of a role than just relying on well made-up (virtual) demons spinning around the ceiling emitting threatening shrieks. It's not terrible - it moves along quickly for ninety minutes and might just put you off a bath anytime shortly afterwards, but there just isn't any real sense of menace or jeopardy and to be honest I wasn't entirely sure that the family weren't nightmarish enough - before their visitor arrived. Perfectly watchable on the telly around Halloween with a drink in your hand, and it's a sort of gift that keeps on giving because you'll be able to watch it again the next year without the faintest recollection of what is going to happen!",2023-05-16T12:25:17.923Z,713704,3 stars,0.4728544354438782
Nathan,8.0,"Evil Dead Rise puts a creative spin on the classic franchise while also remaining faithful to the core experience.

The story is not overly complex and admittedly somewhat generic, as the main characters find the Book of the Dead, read it, and all hell breaks loose. But the conditions surrounding this plot are what truly set it apart. For one, the high-rise setting was brilliant and created a very claustrophobic environment that worked really well. I found the earthquake to be an original idea not only for the discovery of The Necronomicon but also for the entrapment of our main characters.

Speaking of our cast, this film does a really great job of setting up these characters. I genuinely liked all of them, which made it difficult to see some of them go, unlike in Evil Dead (2013). The familiar bond between them was palpable, and this could not have been done without a fantastic cast. Alyssa Sutherland is by far my favorite Deadite in the entire franchise. Her motherly connection was haunting, her facial expressions, and mannerisms are nightmare fuel. Lily Sullivan was genuinely fantastic as a final girl. Her badass nature to defend the children is incredible, and she had some really great moments to stand out in the film. The kids overall did fine, nothing that was too amazing but nothing that took away from the film either.

The direction was my favorite part of the film by far. Lee Cronin did such a fantastic job with haunting camera work with subtle tilts and use of reflections. The action was top-notch, and the practical effects were amazing. So many scenes had me physically wincing with some insanely creative violence mixed with stomach-churning blood and wound effects. It is definitely a worthy successor to Evil Dead (2013) in the gore department.

Overall, this may not be the best in the franchise, but I think it is one of the most refined. The story lacks in some areas, but the direction, performances, and violence really cement this as one of the best horror films of the year.

Brent Marchant,2.0,"As contemporary horror films go, I’ll freely admit that this is a genre about which I couldn’t care less. I find most of these films boring, predictable, stupid and not especially scary. In fact, the only ones to which I’ll even give a second look are smart horror films (like “Get Out” (2017) or “Annihilation” (2018)) or campy romps (like “Renfield” (2023)). So the fact that I somehow managed to sit through this trash heap is quite an accomplishment. (Actually, the only reason I watched was because I was channel surfing and there was nothing else on, so I decided to give it a chance (I would have been better turning on the radio).) This pointless parade of endless blood and gore is a prime example of the decline of the mainstream movie industry (how projects like this get greenlighted is beyond me, except, of course, for the obvious box office considerations). It’s so utterly ridiculous that the picture plays like something that was made up as the crew went along. I’ll admit that there was some modestly cheeky humor here, but not enough to make it a genuine camp fest. Writer-director Lee Cronin’s latest is an assault on the art of filmmaking, the kind that should carry fines and other punishments.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Nicholas Hoult is the eponymous vampire ""familial"" whose job it is, is to cater for the needs of his toothy master (Nicolas Cage) who is distinctly under the weather. He is gradually tiring of the relentlessness of his tasks - especially as procuring food for his boss is becoming more and more difficult; as well having to rely on his own unsavoury diet of bugs - they give him super strength for a few moments. Meantime, the ballsy police officer ""Quincy"" (Awkwafina) is trying to finally nail ""Teddy Lobo"" (Ben Schwartz) whose mother ""Bella"" (Shohreh Aghdashloo) heads up the city's most ruthless gang of drug dealing hoods and who has bribed just about every city official. Serendipity takes an hand when ""Renfield"" comes across this officer in a diner and after a lively altercation the two find themselves united in their determination to achieve their goals. To be honest, the story is pretty lightweight and just reminded me of an episode of ""Buffy"". What makes this a bit more fun is the two characterisations. Hoult joins in. He is clearly having fun with his insects and his acrobatics. Cage is also up for the task at hand. He is super-hammy and at times reminded me more of Sir Anthony Hopkin's ""Hannibal Lecter"" than of anything Christopher Lee ever did. I saw this on my own in a cinema last night which was a bid sad - it's not a great film, but it is still a mildly amusing mickey-take of this genre (and of what passes for film-noir nowadays) and though instantly forgettable, is still a well produced and enjoyable enough gore-fest.",2023-04-17T07:24:59.650Z,649609,4 stars,0.49885427951812744
Chris Sawin,6.0,"_Renfield_ is an okay horror comedy. It has a ton of potential with its excessive amount of blood and Nicolas Cage is worth the price of admission alone. The action sequences have all of their entertainment value sucked away by the end of the film; mostly because they all feel so similar. The humor and story reach a brick wall that the filmmakers refuse to stop pounding your face into.

_Renfield_ is like the junk food version of a horror comedy. It has all the right ingredients for something that should be fantastic, but its recipe for action, comedy, and satisfying storytelling is imbalanced to the point of near disgust.

""Renfield is yet another movie that provides precisely what it promises - with an unbelievably ridiculous, purposefully silly story about the toxic relationship between Dracula and Renfield, expectedly elevated by the ""OTT King"" Nicolas Cage and an up-to-the-challenge Nicholas Hoult. The light, humorous environment leaves space for action sequences that are also intentionally excessive in all technical elements, which makes the entertainment levels inconsistent due to the continuous blend of quick cuts and outrageous amounts of blood. The dedication of the stunt team deserved better and much more screen time. Still, if you're a Cage fan, you won't be disappointed.""

garethmb,-1.0,"Over the decades countless movies, plays, books, comics, video games, and

television shows have depicted Vampires in various mythos which often
include differences in behaviors, abilities, and, motivations. While there have been many Vampires, none have ever achieved the fabled
status of Dracula who has been the template ever since Stokers’s book and
the classic original film as well as subsequent appearances. In the new film “Renfield” audiences are introduced to Renfield (Nicholas Holt), who recounts his past as an ambitious lawyer who ended up serving
Dracula (Nicolas Cage) as a Familiar when his original intention was to
close a real estate deal. After his Master is injured after another attempt by Vampire Hunters,
Renfield relocates Dracula to New Orleans and looks to find suitable prey
to help his master return to full power.

 This in turn leads Renfield to a self-help group as he plans to help the
poor souls there by using their tormentors as prey for his boss which he
hopes will in some way eliminate the burden that has built over the
decades from his servitude. This plan goes horribly wrong when he attempts to subdue an abusive
individual and his group lands Renfield on the radar as not only an eager
a police officer named Rebecca ( Awkwafina), and a drug lord named Edward
(Ben Schwartz). Mixing humor, action, and gore aplenty, Renfield must also deal with his
rising self-help motivations as he looks to stand up to his boss once and
for all and have his needs heard and respected which naturally does not
sit Weill with Dracula.

What follows is an amusing, chaotic, and gory adventure that while at
times inconsistent and meandering with the story; still finds enough ways
to entertain.

Cage hams it up to new levels in his portrayal of Dracula and he is
literally chewing the scenery in every scene in which he is featured and
it is one of his most enjoyable performances in recent years.

Hoult, Awkfwafina, and the supporting cast work well, and while the film
does get more than a bit loose with the story and gaps in logic even for a
film of this type it still manages to work. Dracula talks of a big plan
for world domination but we get little more than lip service which would
have helped to make this version of Dracula a more defined character.

The focus is more on comedic action than horror and it is clear that the
the cast seemed to be having a great time with their roles so as long as you
are willing to overlook issues with the plot; you may find “Renfield” one
of the more enjoyable comedic outings of the year.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,4.0,"If not for a trademark over-the-top Nicolas Cage performance and a truly inspired fight scene in an apartment complex, “Renfield” would be a total disaster of a movie. It’s certainly not any good and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone, and the real horror of it all is the way director Chris McKay blows what should have been a slam-dunk premise.

Set in present day, Renfield (Nicholas Hoult) is the tortured, loyal assistant to Dracula (Cage). He’s served his master for decades, taking care of everything from getting his cape dry cleaned to procuring fresh prey for dinner. After centuries of servitude, Renfield is finally ready to move on and create a life of his own.

Although it is mostly dead in the water, the film’s pacing never feels slow. There’s plenty of entertainment, it’s just not fun enough, outrageous enough, nor twisted enough. The tone is both tongue-in-cheek and sincere, which is not cohesive as a whole. There’s a lot of action that means nothing, and characters like Awkwafina‘s police officer that are bland and forgettable.

The side plots about a crime family with a ruthless boss (Shohreh Aghdashloo) and her son (Ben Schwartz) that wants Renfield dead is half-baked, and the funny group therapy bits where Dracula’s assistant seeks help for co-dependency and dealing with his raging narcissist of a boss falls flat. The ideas all sound so good on paper, but are poorly executed across the board. That’s why the movie feels so underwhelming.

Cage is by far the best part of this mess, and he is an actor who is born to play Dracula. He hams it up in every scene, and his unhinged take is genuinely scary but also goofy. His manic line delivery and unhinged inflection of such dialogue gems like “Hail Satan” is absolute bliss.

The blood and gore is over-the-top and mostly used in a humorous manner, but this isn’t for the squeamish. There is graphic throat ripping, spurting blood, and abdomens slit open with internal organs visibly spilling out. McKay doesn’t shy away from the violence (and the makeup and effects are really great), which should at least delight horror fans.

With such a great idea for story, it’s a bummer that “Renfield” is disappointing in nearly every way imaginable. You’ll find yourself mourning what it could have been.

MovieGuys,6.0,"Its been a while since I've seen Nicolas Cage in a role, I feel, does him justice. Renfield gives Cage the opportunity to shine. 

His comedic take on Dracula combined with the ""very English"" performance, handed in by Nicholas Hoult, makes this film work, in spite of itself. 

The comedic premise behind Renfield is highly original, I'd even say, quite clever. Whats not so intelligent, however, is the handling. 

The potential for comedic flair and fun is drowned, in good measure, by the over the top, often rather grotesquely visceral, blood soaked, violence. Violence that's on the cusp, of the proverbial, splatter flick. 

In summary, a moderately watchable film that leaves the compelling feeling, it could have amounted to more, with subtler, less violent, treatment.",2023-05-05T05:05:27.354Z,649609,3 stars,0.5413763523101807
erosap,7.0,"Awkwafina should have been on the poster!
=========================================

Not knowing she was in this, is what probably made me resist watching Renfield right away. She is the most watchable part of the film.

Maybe because the rest is not a revelation; everything that happens in the movie with Cage and Hoult, is just predictable vampire tropes—the trailer was enough for that.

At any moment, it was neither horror, nor comedy. Although, at the very beginning, the recovering Dracula is convincingly threatening; but not once he 'gains full power'.
The excessive, exploding blood-works would have been funny, if they were selective with it's use. But they end up using it everywhere, even the kills that are meant to invoke fear and sadness. Perhaps it was an attempt at nonsense comedy. But, didn't come across very well.

Nathan,4.0,"I was not expecting much from Renfield and it pretty much gave me exactly what I was expecting: a mediocre film that was nothing offensive but all too forgettable.

The screenplay is really all over the place. There are too many subplots and not enough time spent on the actual draw to the film, Dracula. Awkwafina's subplot was half baked and really did not go anywhere. I felt as though her character could have entirely been written out of the film to spend more time on Renfield and Dracula. The comedy is pretty bad. I do not remember laughing one time during the hour-thirty-minute runtime. There were clear jokes that they were trying to set up, but they just did not land for me.

Performances were fine. Nicholas Cage was great as Dracula, but unfortunately did not have enough screen time or material to really make a huge impact on the film. Nicholas Holt was good in his role, but again I do not think he had much to work with. Everyone else gave really average performances. Awkwafina plays literally the same style of character as she did in Shang Chi, and it was fine, but nothing that really blew me away.

The direction was pretty poor. So many action scenes had a tremendous amount of shaky cam and some weird motion blur type effect that made it really hard to see what was happening. It was brutal, don't get me wrong, and I loved what they attempted to go for, but it really just landed flat. Coming off from John Wick just a few weeks ago, the action direction was apparently bad. The gore was at an extreme, but for the love of God, why did they choose to use CGI blood? The graphics literally looked like something out of a PS2 Mortal Kombat; absolutely terrible. Which is a shame because that mixed with the poor action direction really took me out of every scene when I should have been locked in having a bloody good time.

Overall, this film is a misstep in what could have been a fun, campy, cult classic. The jumbled screenplay, poor stunt choreography, and terrible effects really hold this movie back from its true potential. There is nothing truly awful that make this a bad movie, just enough there to make it an extremely average experience.

Nicolas Cage is a nice piece of casting and delivers in the role of Dracula, as I'd expect to be honest... feels like a Cage sorta character! Nicholas Hoult and Awkwafina are decent, I've seen better from the latter elsewhere but her performance improves as this one progresses. Honestly, I would've reworked the film to revolve around Cage, rather than Hoult.

The story didn't really connect with me, as in I didn't get the required entertainment from it. It's alright, I just didn't really care for what I was watching - more like just acknowledging its existence, rather than actually sinking my teeth into what was happening onscreen.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Matt Damon is on strong form here as the out-of-shape Nike basketball executive Sonny Vaccaro. At the usual routine selection meeting at the start of the season he realises that their paltry $250k budget isn't going to enable them to sign anyone with enough impact to lift his company from a distant third behind Converse and Adidas in the market. A bit of lateral thinking and some convincing of marketing VP Rob Strasser (a good effort from Jason Bateman, too) takes him before the bare-footed, grape coloured Porsche owning, Phil Knight - the CEO (Ben Affleck) with an off-the-wall plan to put all of their eggs in one basket and go for the upcoming Michael Jordan. Scepticism abounds, not least because the man's agent (Chris Messina) makes it clear that Jordan has no interest at all in signing with them. Vaccaro is not a man to take no for an answer and what now ensues demonstrates how his unorthodox methods, his honesty, determination and his ability to coax, cajole and persuade managed to create something that is not just the stuff of sporting history, but of visionary commercial history too. A few potent appearances from Viola Davis illustrate that Vaccarro was not the only shrewd individual at the negotiating table and there are some lovely, almost head banging, appearances from Messina as the deal edges ever closer (or does it?). Affleck also appears infrequently, but he is effective - indeed his one set piece scene with the Jordans is actually quite cringeworthy to watch. It's a well known story so the plot hasn't any jeopardy. That said, though, Affleck manages to create a sense of will they/won't they that sustains this characterful and entertaining drama for just short of two hours and puts the engaging dynamic between Damon and Bateman to good use. The script is quickly paced, frequently pithy and has a natural flow to it that - save for Chris Tucker's portrayal of Howard White which I found just a bit too Jesse Jackson for me - all works well. I am not sure this is a film you will remember down the line, but I did enjoy it.",2023-04-14T08:52:05.001Z,964980,4 stars,0.48516732454299927
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,8.0,"“Air” is a sports marketing drama that delivers satisfying entertainment with a feel-good, universal appeal. Never would I have guessed that a film about business deals and shoe marketing would be so engaging, but this true story about the game-changing partnership in 1984 between an NBA rookie named Michael Jordan and the athletic apparel company Nike is gratifying on all levels. You don’t have to be a basketball fan or even know anything about Jordan to enjoy this film. It’s a biopic all right – but of the men behind the Air Jordan sneaker line, not the superstar athlete.

Directed by Ben Affleck (who also co-stars), the film explores the history of how the legendary Air Jordan sneaker line was birthed into existence, telling the story of the high-stakes business gamble that had the potential to make or break Nike.

When scout and basketball division lead Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon) sets his sights on the talented UNC rookie (who has recently been drafted by the Chicago Bulls) to be the athlete that Nike needs to boost their shoe line, he is met with resistance from his team of reluctant colleagues. They’re skeptical at first, but eventually find Sonny’s passion to be contagious and hop on board.

Much of the narrative is focused on the behind-the-scenes company men, discussions about money, and valid concerns about taking a huge risk on Sonny’s gut feeling that this kid has the potential to become an international sports superstar. There’s a lot shown about the creativity process, brainstorming sessions, and outside-the-box marketing that helped Nike sell their shoes to an up-and-coming NBA player. Although it may sound like it, this isn’t a dry business story, but an enjoyable film filled with casual charm.

Affleck includes a who’s who of Nike in the 80s, from Peter Moore (Matthew Maher), Nike’s Creative Director and the man who designed the Air Jordan sneaker (and also had the brilliant idea to put Jordan’s silhouette on the product line), Howard White (Chris Tucker), who influenced the basketball player to sign with the company, Marketing Director Rob Strasser (Jason Bateman), and Nike co-founder Phil Knight (Affleck), who credits the Air Jordan as the product that saved his company.

A secondary plot line involves Sonny’s efforts to convince Jordan’s bulldog agent David Falk (Chris Messina) and family, in particular his smart and savvy mother Deloris (Viola Davis), to sign with Nike over the more popular competing brands Converse and Adidas. Discussions between Sonny and Deloris deliver the film’s most powerful scenes, especially when you see a tenacious mother who knows her son’s worth and has no problem holding her own in a room full of corporate suits. It’s unusual to find a film that keeps the audience invested in the story from both sides, and I found myself hoping for Sonny to land a great contract but also for Deloris to get the best deal possible for her son and family.

To reveal more about the story would constitute major spoilers, especially if you are unfamiliar with the history of the shoe, but Affleck’s storytelling is so engaging that it will keep you emotionally invested even if you know the eventual outcome.

As a director, Affleck has an enviable, natural flair for telling true stories. His casual style and instincts are on full display here. The film is an example of one of those instances that are few and far between, where the subject matter is the perfect match for the director. This is a story that obviously is close to Affleck’s heart, and it’s reflected throughout the film.

“Air” is a well-made movie about the American Dream from two different sides of the equation. There aren’t many missteps here, and everything from the direction, lively screenplay (written by Alex Convery), and warm performances all flow together in perfect harmony.

Ritesh Mohapatra,-1.0,"A staggering tale of an unhinged perseverance which is backed by a captivating screenplay.


Air is a story so frivolous and flat , that the courage of Ben Affleck should be lauded with our hats down. A simple plot which would fit within 3 lines of a page is magically presented to us as a fascinating and appealing peace of history which changed the strature of business in sports in America and revolutionized a global culture, Nike's collaboration with the greatest basketball player in the history of the game, ""Michael Jordan"". The 2 hours doesn't feel long when you have a dazzling screenplay & a marvelous ensemble cast with their pragmatic conversations. Ben Affleck really puts in a fine effort to yield such sensational performances for the star studded cast. 

Brilliant is an understatement for the ensemble cast. I have never seen a better grounded performance of Matt Damon than this. He is sensational. Jason Bateman and Viola Davis add the much needed spark with their magnetic performances. Good to see Chris Tucker back and boy he just gets his sense of humor right each time. The banters between Matt and Chris Messina is the highlight for me. Ben Affleck is a master in terms of direction, the way he manages veterans into building such a collaboration is astounding. 

Overall, If you believe in uplifting stories behind sports and redefining moments of history which changed the world we live in today then Air is a great addition to your watchlist.

r96sk,9.0,"Slightly forced 1980s aesthetic/nostalgia trip aside, <em>'Air'</em> is quality!

The 80s was before my time, so I guess I'm not best placed to talk about it, but the constant shots of 80s things with 80s music with extremely 80s enviroments did get a tiny bit tiresome to me. I recall people saying similar-ish with <em>'Stranger Things'</em> season 3, though I found the mix of it there to more befitting. I'm nit-picking, I know, but it just was super noticeable to me here.

Anyway, enough of that unimportant stuff. The film is great. The whole cast do terrific work, particularly Matt Damon, Viola Davis (the phone call scene between those two is excellent), Jason Bateman and Ben Affleck. I'd say the secondary portion of the almost 2hrs is the stronger, prior to that I was intrigued but not invested... by the end I was both. It's a predictable story, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.

The decision to practically not have a Michael Jordan character in a movie about Michael Jordan is an interesting one. It feels a tad awkward when he is in a scene and they intentionally 'hide' him. I get why, and it mostly works, but it does feel dorky at a point or two.

Overall, very good. To be honest, ignore my above nit-picks - it's most definitely worthy of a watch.",2023-05-18T00:12:18.625Z,964980,4 stars,0.7320324778556824

""Air soars with a chemistry-filled cast, offering lively performances across the board, with Matt Damon standing out in particular. Alex Convery's excellent script showcases some of the sharpest writing in recent sports biopic history, blending humor and drama seamlessly, despite not breaking any new ground within the subgenre, adhering to familiar tropes and overall structure. The kinetic dialogue keeps every scene incredibly entertaining, making the almost two-hour runtime fly by. Ben Affleck continues to prove his talent as both director and actor. Surprisingly engaging even for non-basketball enthusiasts. A highly enjoyable, well-executed original story about how one shoe changed the world.""

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Based on a real character from the murkier side of quite recent Vatican operations, Russell Crowe dons his cassock and travels to a remote abbey in Spain where his meets with ""Fr. Esquibel"" (Daniel Zovatto). Why? Well it seems that a young boy is being possessed by a singularly nasty demon. Now Fr. Amorth is not unused to these scenarios and is also aware that the vast majority of these situations have nothing to do with satanic practices and more to do with mental health issues. Quickly, though, he realises that this is a serious and potentially deadly demonisation and both he and his colleague must discover what went on at this place and just who their violent foe is, before they can have any hope of casting it back into the shadows. That's the plot, and to be fair Crowe actually plays his character with a bit of charisma, but the rest of this is the same old loudly scored, visual effects feast with plenty of routine dramatic scenes: screaming, eye-popping, ceiling climbing, bodies and holy water thrown about the place and this one even has a bit of the Spanish Inquisition thrown in for added authenticity. It's not that is terrible - it isn't; it is just all so very derivative. Just because the exorcist was real doesn't actually make this film any different from an whole spate of other similar films that have the same beginning, middle, and end... It will do fine on the television around Halloween, but the cinema adds little to the presentation. It's nice to see that Franco Nero is still making films, but otherwise this is adequate, but nothing more.",2023-04-13T11:12:45.293Z,758323,3 stars,0.44448867440223694

Russell Crowe elevates the movie quite a bit with a well-rounded performance, seamlessly blending the dramatic moments with his character's comedic personality.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,7.0,"When you buy a ticket for a movie like “The Pope’s Exorcist” it’s pretty clear what you’re getting into. There’s a ton of Catholic imagery like the rosary, crucifixes, holy water, church rituals, and lots of prayers, all used to fight off the demonic possession of an innocent. All of the standard elements are present here, but director Julius Avery‘s film surprisingly offers a refreshing (if somewhat routine) take on the religious horror subgenre.

Elevated by a well thought-out story and an engaging performance from Russell Crowe, the film tells the story of Father Gabriele Amorth (Crowe), Chief Exorcist of the Vatican (and one of the most controversial figures in the Church’s modern era). The script is inspired by the Father’s actual files of his time spent conducting exorcisms for the Catholic Church, which is enough to make your skin crawl.

The movie follows Father Amorth as he travels to Spain to investigate a young boy’s (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) possession by a powerful demon. Aided by local priest Father Esquibel (Daniel Zovatto), Father Amorth tries to help the child before it’s too late. In the process, he uncovers a centuries-old conspiracy that the Vatican has desperately tried to keep hidden.

It’s a really great story, and one that feels more plausible than other religious horror fantasies about supernatural possessions. (You know what I mean). There are solid scares, bloody violence, and creepy imagery that are all done quite well. It’s slightly goofy but played with sincerity, which is why the film never teeters on the edge of camp. This isn’t a case of a movie that’s so bad it’s good, it actually is good.

While it may seem like there isn’t a lot here to separate the film from other exorcism stories (especially when there are several scenes of priests reciting prayers while brandishing crosses at a child who, possessed by a demon, is screaming obscenities in a growling voice), the depth of the storytelling is what makes a huge difference. Every element clicks in unison here, from the screenplay to the direction to the better than expected performances.

“The Pope’s Exorcist” is the type of movie that should be forgettable, but isn’t. I actually enjoyed it because it overdelivers on what it promises, and is a lot better than you’d expect.

Towards the end of the movie, I literally starting thinking, “wow, Crowe and Zovatto should star in future installments as ass-kicking priest sidekicks,” and bam! The film went ahead and set itself up for a sequel: 199 of them, to be exact. As batty as this sounds, I would — pun intended — watch the hell out of that.

Nathan,6.0,"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed The Pope's Exorcist. After initially seeing the trailers, I wrote this movie off as a standard possession film that I have seen time and time again, and while most of that is still true, there is something about this film that made it a joy to watch.

The film does not attempt to do anything particularly new or groundbreaking in the genre, but everything it has is handled with care and precision. The direction is fantastic, with a very quick pace that makes each scene have a sense of urgency as our characters attempt to perform the exorcism. There is particularly deep lore that is established within the church structure, with different factions and politics at play that add a slightly different dimension rather than just your run-of-the-mill ""insert random priest here.""

My favorite aspect of the film is the acting. I think all of the adult characters do a tremendous job here. Russell Crowe kills it in every scene he is in and definitely gives an entirely different take on the exorcist character. Where most are intensely serious and melodramatic, Crowe adds a bit of whimsicalness and youth to the character that creates a calming presence to every intense scene. His rapport with Daniel Zovatto is excellent. The two really play off each other well and carried the film in many ways. Alex Essoe was great, although underutilized. The two children were okay. The boy gave a very stereotypical portrayal of a possessed child, and the daughter was flat in many ways.

My only complaint about the entire film is its lack of originality and the story. Every single beat is something that we have seen before; there were no new or fresh ideas that were interjected into the story. The tension was fine, but nothing was particularly scary. Overall, if not for the film's fantastic director and cast, it would have been a bomb.

Nathan,7.0,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a fun ride through the iconic world of Mario. The screenplay is admittedly very bare bones, and the characters lack depth, but the film still manages to capture the essence of the beloved video game franchise. The writers do not attempt to do anything beyond create a narrative that intentionally puts our characters in worlds and areas that are instantly recognizable to the audience. This makes the film feel like a Mario game come to life so that audiences can say “that is like Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros.” The movie pacing flies at a breakneck speed, and I felt that this movie could have benefited from a slightly longer runtime to flesh out the story and characters a bit more.

I was initially nervous about how the voice acting would hold up, but I was pleasantly surprised. Chris Pratt's voice as Mario is not over the top, which works well. It would have been extremely annoying to hear the super Italian Mario accent for a full hour and thirty minutes. Jack Black's portrayal of Bowser steals the show and was the best of the film. Anna Taylor Joy and Seth Rogan were good as Princess Peach and Donkey Kong, although I think Rogan may have injected a bit too much of himself in the character.

The direction of the film is solid, with great action set pieces and creative camera angles that make the action feel exciting and dynamic. The animation is stunning, with the characters and world directly designed off the games, but with more polish and details than ever before. The lighting is beautiful, with the bright lights of Rainbow Road and the dark, fiery flames of Bowser standing out as highlights.

Overall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie may not be the deepest or most complex film, but it is a good time for fans of the Mario franchise. The movie captures the fun and whimsy tone of the games and brings it to life on the big screen. While the comedy may not hit every mark, the voice acting, and direction make up for it. I am excited to see where this film series goes next.

For myself , this felt very much like a movie made for Super Mario Bros fans and less for the general audience.

The characters, the completely illogical platform jumping everywhere and the rather childish story are certain to appeal to younger people still playing the game or those that grew up with the Mario Bros games.

For me though the movie was ranging from okayish to, sometimes, cringe worthy. Especially the scenes with Bowser starting to sing. Ouch, my ears are still hurting.

The best parts of the movie was when they entered the ape kingdom. That was quite fun and so was the car chase on the rainbow road.

All the other voice actors—Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, and everyone else—did a great job!

CinemaSerf,6.0,"I fully expected to hate this - but, well, I didn't. ""Abby"" (Virginia Gardner) is fed up picking up the pieces for her gambler father so heads to college in California. First night there, she and her pal ""America"" (Libe Barer) head off to a student equivalent of ""Fight Club"" where she meets the bare knuckle champion ""Travis"" (Dylan Sprouse). Replete with some of his latest victim's blood on her top, she feigns a loathing for the man but... Shortly afterwards, their dorm water supply runs dry and she has to move in with her friend. Guess what? Yep, one of her new roomies is none other than the mischievous pugilist. There now follows a rather contrived - and frankly ridiculous - bet that sees her end up sharing his bed for a month, Will they, won't they? That doesn't matter - this film isn't about jeopardy. It's about pretty people having a bit of a laugh and hoping some of that rubs off on us. I found there to a bit of chemistry between the two, ""Travis"" is actually quite charismatic and the humour is marginally more sophisticated than we would find in, say, the interminable ""After..."" series of teen melodramas. It's trying to do grown up, and it makes a half-decent fist of it. The last twenty minutes are particularly daft though - and did rather ruin the thing. It certainly does not need a cinema viewing (even though there were certainly 50+ people at the screening I attended) - but even if it is too long, it's still an OK watch.",2023-04-13T10:02:14.408Z,1016121,2 stars,0.49404531717300415
The Movie Mob,7.0,"<b>Murder Mystery 2 made me laugh. What more do you need from an Adam Sandler Netflix original?</b>

Murder Mystery 2… It won't dazzle critics, but for people who enjoy a good laugh and Adam Sandler fans, this movie will be a blast! This marks the third film pairing Adam Sandler with Jennifer Aniston, and their chemistry takes Murder Mystery 2 from ridiculous to charming and entertaining. If you enjoyed the first movie, the sequel continues all the dynamics and hilarity that made its predecessor successful with a little more polish and experience. The fight scene in the van had me laughing so hard my wife judged me a little 😆. The cheese bit and other reoccurring gags were undoubtedly immature… but pretty funny and exactly what you would expect of an Adam Sandler film. Don't compare this movie to Knives Out or Glass Onion. Instead, compare it to Happy Gilmore and The Wedding Singer with a little more murder. Murder Mystery 2 is a Netflix streaming sequel, so don't set your expectations high, but Adam Sandler fans and people that just want a good time will enjoy it.",2023-04-01T22:39:51.445Z,638974,4 stars,0.540866494178772

These feel like the sort of flicks that should be getting 6/10 (or lower) from me but when the credits have rolled on each film I can't deny that I didn't not like what I had just sat through and watched. I haven't really got that many positives either, but rating it lower just feels off to me for some reason. It's a decent murder mystery <em>(ha! I said the thing!)</em>

Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston are a passable pairing, as a duo I don't think they are all that effective but do do the job and individually I'm evidently content to watch them act; esp. Aniston. Mark Strong, Mélanie Laurent and Adeel Akhtar are some of the others that are involved and, again, they give what's required. Akhtar's character is initially annoying but ends up being fine, and I like the actor from <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/four-lions/"" rel=""nofollow"">Four Lions</a>'</em> and (the quality) <em>'<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(British_TV_series)"" rel=""nofollow"">Utopia</a>'<em>.

The plot is pretty typical, but they make no connection between the main villain and the crime that took place. It’s just a person that randomly shows up and then we’re allowed to believe that they had a part and everything.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Now I really did enjoy this, but let's not for a moment pretend that it has much originality to it. We start with a scene borrowed from ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) before getting introduced to the wise-cracking ""Edgin"" (Chris Pine) who has been incarcerated in an impregnable prison with his pal ""Holga"" (Michelle Rodriguez). They're at a sort of parole board hearing awaiting the arrival of ""Jarnathan"" for whom they have a rather surprising use! What now follows in an exciting and quickly paced series of escapades that sees our escapees try to reconcile with his daughter ""Kira"" (Chloe Coleman) whom they left in the capable - they thought - hands of their pal ""Forge"" (Hugh Grant). It turns out that he has his own agenda, and together with the mysterious ""Sofina"" (Daisy Head) is working on a plan to garner untold riches. That latter creature, though, has her own agenda too - a much more malevolent and dastardly one. ""Edgin"" and ""Holga"" have to find a magical helmet in order to spring his daughter and so recruiting the rather hapless sorceror ""Simon"" (Justice Smith) and the shape-shifting ""Doric"" (Sophia Lillis) set off in search of the legendary warrior ""Xenk"" (Regé-Jean Page) and perilous adventures beckon. This actually works well as an entertaining, episodic, collection of short stories that pitch our heroes agains a wonderfully chubby dragon, some dead but undead soldiers and along the way treats us to bits of ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"" by way of ""Maze Runner"". ""Robin Hood"" and some stunningly presented magical duels worthy of Edgar Allan Poe. There is plenty of pith in the script - a bit of sarcasm never goes wrong; the cast genuinely seem to be having fun as their quest lurches from the frying pan to the fire each time and there is a suitably conniving effort from Grant to top it all off and keep us interested. I was a little disappointed in Page. He doesn't really have so much to do, and features rather sparingly - but Pine shows something of his versatility as an actor (perhaps not so much with his lute) and the whole thing delivers an amusing ensemble effort that passes 2¼ hours predictably, but nonetheless enjoyably. I could have done with more dragons and sorcery, but the visual effects are still put to good use to support a character-led, light-hearted, drama that is really only worth seeing on a big screen.

Innovator,8.0,"The numerous manuals on my shelves for 1st to 5e speak volumes of my familiarity with the game, as does the novels I own, and the numerous D&D computer games I've played, so I was ecstatic seeing the places, people, and creatures I know very well. I've heard others who have played the game say they wished they had done a movie about characters like Elminster, Drizzt Do'Urden, or Alias instead. While they would have been nice to see, those characters are from the lore not the game. What I was more hoping for was that the characters in this movie felt like the characters the players play, the adventures they go on, and the antics they get themselves into. This movie felt like that in spades, and it was an absolute joy to see. I watched this and was constantly reminded of the crazy things I did as a player or watched others do as their DM, and more importantly the fun we had playing the game we all loved. This is why I give it my highest recommendation to all others who have played the game, and especially to those who have not so they may see for themselves what Dungeons & Dragons is really about. 8/10",2023-04-19T09:00:11.203Z,493529,5 stars,0.6143062114715576
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,8.0,"Based on the legendary role-playing game, “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” is nothing like what I anticipated and much better than I expected. This irresistible fantasy adventure has a healthy dose of good humor, playful charm, and is easily accessible to all who love imaginary worlds filled with wizards, sorcerers, warlocks, knights, and fire-breathing dragons.

Charismatic thief Edgin (Chris Pine) and his band of unlikely adventurers (including Holga (Michelle Rodriguez) the barbarian) undertake an epic heist to retrieve a lost relic and to liberate his daughter (Chloe Coleman) from Forge’s (Hugh Grant) castle. Things go dangerously awry when they run afoul of the wrong people, but the group must work together to overcome seemingly never-ending obstacles as they continue their important quest.

While directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein stay true to the origins of the game, prior knowledge of Dungeons & Dragons isn’t necessary. The film explains everything you need to know, making this an action adventure that’s appropriate for everyone. It’s surprising just how accessible this movie is. You don’t have to know the rules of the game to get a real kick out of this one. I’m sure there are plenty of Easter eggs hidden around for the gamers, but it’s not so insider that the uninitiated can’t understand what’s going on. This is definitely one of the film’s greatest strengths.

The story (with a script by Goldstein, Daley, and Michael Gilio) is solid too, with well-developed characters and irreverent humor that keeps the movie from becoming just another based-on-a-game throwaway. There’s a ton of heart and genuine emotion, which is elevated by the terrific cast. The actors play off each other well, giving a human element to what thankfully is not just a bunch of dumb CGI. You can feel the real connection between Edgin and Holga, best friends who always have each other’s backs, and Rodriguez and Pine’s chemistry finds the perfect groove. Grant, who is having a career resurgence lately, is as delightful as ever as the rogue Forge Fitzwilliam, as is Justice Smith as amateur sorcerer Simon and Sophia Lillis as shape shifting tiefling druid Doric. Most shocking is that Pine isn’t doing yet another version of his annoying shtick here, which in itself is a massive achievement.

The pacing is brisk and the special effects are well done, even if the finale is stretched a little thin. I found it easy to become engrossed in the mythical world of D&D not only because the movie looks great visually, but the characters are appealing, too. There’s plenty to root for.

Even if you think you aren’t a fan of the fantasy genre, I suggest you give “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” a try. This playful, character-driven adventure offers a ton of magical fun at the movies.

Nathan,8.0,"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a great movie that strikes a perfect balance between high fantasy and comedy.

The screenplay for the movie was pretty average in terms of the overall plot, but the individual story beats and set pieces really carried the movie forward. What makes the screenplay stand out is the creativity behind each character, giving them interesting scenes and moments to shine. The dialogue was sharp and witty, filled with great laughs throughout. However, some of the comedy was very generic, with jokes and physical comedy that have been done a dozen times over.

The performances in the film were very solid, with Chris Pine stealing the show as the lead. Pine was extremely witty and charismatic, with excellent comedic timing. Michelle Rodriguez, while playing a pretty flat character, had incredible action scenes. Rege-Jean Page was a standout in every scene he was in, with over-the-top and hilarious moments that left me in stitches. Justice Smith, who hasn't been one of my favorite actors, did well here as a great comedic character. Sophia Lillis, while not getting a ton of time to shine in terms of her acting chops, was amazing in her action set pieces, especially in the long sequence where her character shape shifts while escaping from the castle.

The direction of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves was surprisingly stellar. The action was sharp and well-choreographed, with minimal cuts allowing the audience to really get a larger grasp of what was happening. The film balanced comedy and high fantasy elements really well. While the shots weren't overly creative, the movie looked fantastic with beautiful landscapes and above-average CGI.

In conclusion, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a great movie that exceeded my expectations. With a creative screenplay, solid performances, and fantastic direction, it deserves to be seen on the big screen.

Wuchak,6.0,"**_Rebooting the sword & sorcery series with Chris Pine and Michelle Rodriguez_** 

A former member of the Harpers turned thief (Pine) amasses a group of unique individuals in order to acquire a magic relic, The Helm of Disjunction, and get his daughter back from a conman Lord (Hugh Grant) and his Red Wizard accomplice (Daisy Head). The adventurers include a barbarian (Rodriguez), an amateur sorcerer (Justice Smith), a shape-changing tiefling (Sophia Lillis) and a noble paladin (Regé-Jean Page).

""Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” (2023) reboots the trilogy that ran from 2000-2012. It’s easily the best film on a technical level but, story-wise, I prefer the previous two, “Wrath of the Dragon God” (2005) and “The Book of Vile Darkness” (2012), which are more serious.

Like the first one from 2000, it telegraphs from the get-go that it's not to be taken too seriously. If you can roll with the campy air, it’s an amusing throwaway fantasy flick. Imagine the gaudiness of ""Star Wars"" (1977) if the story were transplanted to a Medieval-like kingdom where dragons & magic are reality and you'd have a good idea of what this movie has to offer.

So, it’s a fun, entertaining adventure-fantasy with a good cast and the highlight of petite Sophia Lillis as the elf-like tiefling, but it’s overlong and needed more depth. Plus, there are too many glaring borrowings from other movies, like the frozen-land prison from “Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,” the bald witch-sorceress from “Conan the Barbarian” (2011), Magneto’s helmet from the “X-Men” flicks, bits from the “Thor” and “Guardians of the Galaxy” movies, etc.

The film runs 2 hours, 14 minutes, and was shot in Iceland and Northern Ireland.

The Movie Mob,9.0,"**John Wick: Chapter 4 is at the peak of action cinema and fight choreography. What the film lacks in story is dramatically overcome with the most stunning action set pieces ever seen.**

John Wick: Chapter 4 is an overwhelming feast of action brilliance! For the entire 2.5-hour runtime, this movie transitions from weapon to weapon, set piece to set piece, and spectacle to spectacle topping anything ever seen. The fight sequences never stop, and their beauty and intricacies drop jaw while breaking jaw. From the scene with the nunchucks to swords to shotguns to hatchets to hand-to-hand - among the greatest, if not the pinnacle, of action choreography. The cinematography creatively showcases each scene and battle, painting the action in bright colors and finding clever angles to keep the action fresh and engaging. As always, Reeves is incredible in the role, but the supporting cast of martial artists helps make this film what it is with experienced actors like Hiroyuki Sanada and Scott Adkins. But the absolute standout is Donnie Yen; his speed and skill are breathtaking as he steals every scene he is in. Unfortunately, despite all of its stunning brilliance, the story takes a lot of shortcuts to wrap up John Wick’s story, which disappoints a little. The method to end it all seems like something that would have been mentioned several movies ago. But honestly, who cares? We don’t go to a John Wick movie for a deep story.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Now this is an whole lot better than ""John Wick - Paracetamol"" (2019) but it is still not very good. This time our wandering warrior (Keanu Reeves) is out for revenge, but not before the all-powerful ""Marquis"" (Bill Skarsgård), who has managed to get those at the ""High Table"" to give him complete control of their global operations, decides to seek some of his own - and that includes trashing the New York hotel and putting ""Winston"" (Ian McShane) out of an home and a job. A rather unnecessary, and fatal, side effect of that activity put's his nose out of joint too; and when the ""Marquis"" turns his attention on Osaka - possibly the last bastion of support for ""Wick"", we just know that we are in for a series of never-ending hand-to-hand fisticuffs that are straight out of a video game. Indeed, for almost all of the action sequences here the whole point seems to be: kill as many of the useless, hapless - but heavily armed - enemy as you can whilst perhaps bleeding a little from the mouth now and again. Use your finely tailored Kevlar®️ suit to deflect bullets, blades, flames - just about everything as you, inevitably, survive against constantly insurmountable odds for well over 2½ hours before a denouement that is, admittedly, quite quirky. That involves a sort of Sacre-Coeur version of snakes and ladders but again, luckily, against innumerable would-be assassins who couldn't hit a barn door with an Howitzer at point blank range. Skarsgård isn't remotely menacing - like a poor ""James Bond"" villain in a perfectly measured suit, Laurence Fishburne features only sparingly and the whole thing has as much jeopardy as the 'Wizard of Oz"" (1939). Reeves does not act here, he performs - and the profusion of CGI, the complete lack of any police or domestic military in Japan, Paris or New York to address the increasingly chaotic and damaging carnage being caused in these locations all just wanted me to start shouting ""thwack"" and ""pow"" at the screen. There is a delightful twist at the end, but it's a very long time in the coming and to be perfectly honest, I was just a bit bored. I've never really been in love with this franchise, it's all too repetitive and predictable - and sadly, this is just the same.",2023-03-27T20:57:05.953Z,603692,3 stars,0.5736180543899536

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,8.0,"I don’t need to tell you that the violent action in “John Wick: Chapter 4” is over the top. If you’re aware of the popular neo-noir action thriller franchise, you know that already. If you’re a fan of the smartly dressed, ass kicking antihero known on the streets as the Baba Yaga, you aren’t going to be disappointed in this rowdy, unrestrained fourth chapter. The bar has been raised and effectively met, as this fast-paced film traverses the globe, provides a dose of pure adrenaline, and leaves the franchise’s highest body count in its wake.

After being excommunicated and on the run from a network of bounty hunters, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) has had enough and just wants out of the criminal underworld forever. He tries to kill them all but in the process, discovers a path to defeating The High Table with the goal of finally securing his freedom. John visits former friends, alliances, and foes all over the world, bringing trouble to their doorstep. The lethal assassin fights his way through one by one, culminating in a final duel to the death.

This is Reeves’ movie through and through, and he’s created what has arguably become one of the more iconic screen characters of the 21st century. It’s great to see old favorites like Winston (Ian McShane), Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), and Charon (Lance Reddick) return, but the addition of new characters Caine (Donnie Yen), Mr. Nobody (Shamier Anderson), and the brutally cruel Marquis (Bill Skarsgård) breathes fresh life into the franchise.

The story is weak and the performances not much better, but none of that matters if you’re a fan of pure action and cinematic spectacle. The stunt work (which is heavily influenced by martial arts) reaches absolute perfection, will impeccably choreographed fight sequences that are fresh, inventive, and exciting. The best of the best is a thrilling shootout in the middle of busy traffic by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It’s one of those scenes that makes you want to stand up and cheer.

Director Chad Stahelski is an ex-stuntman himself, and he knows how to orchestrate exhilarating, handsome action sequences. This isn’t a film with rapid cutting where you can’t tell what is going on, and it’s a return to a classic style that should be welcomed by fans of the genre. You can clearly follow each blow to the body, every bloody gunshot to the head, and every sword through the back. Stahelski’s vision is as close to flawless as one can get, and this is a great looking movie from start to finish.

Despite all of the things that are done right, the film’s excessive runtime makes it seem too indulgent. Even with the breathtaking fight choreography and stunt coordination, some of the action scenes go on so long that I started to lose interest. A few are repetitive and exhausting, but the short and well-placed breaks in the form of emotional storytelling bring a welcome respite and a bit of breathing room.

“John Wick: Chapter 4” is a film that over promises yet over delivers for action fans. It’s one rousing, wild ride.

Nathan,9.0,"John Wick 4 is an absolute masterpiece of an action film. From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.

One of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.

But perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.

One slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.

Overall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

MovieGuys,7.0,"The John Wick franchise has now made it to its fourth and maybe final, film. The question is, is it any good?

Simply put, its ""alright"". In much the same way, as its 2019 predecessor, was alright. The script in this kind of exposition driven, action fare does not, typically, change that much. 

A certain amount of creativity and thought, has gone into the stylised, highly choreographed action and violence.

That said, after the first 30 or so minutes of unrelenting gun play/martial art, mash ups, it starts to feeling ""saturating."" 
 
I can see how the creators have tried to alleviate this feeling of repetition, by offering up differing locations, the use of exotic or special weapons but its simply, not enough. A more evolved story would have helped but regrettably, that was not on offer.

In summary, by no means a poor film but not quite as remarkable, in my estimation, as some reviews would suggest. Still, a decent weekend watch, with your mates over a bag or two of chips and a few beers.",2023-05-26T03:34:32.259Z,603692,3 stars,0.591201663017273

Ninehundredmillion (nearly a **billion!** obviously guarantees beautiful pictures - but does that guarantee a profound movie? No!

Since _the Matrix_  Keanu Reeves was established as an action hero - yet he actually never delivered martial arts in a way professionals could relate to him in a way they can to Bruce Lee, Jason Stratham or Jackie Chan (who did perform their own stunts) could. 

Reeves - always somehow clumsy when fighting does kind of ""stagger"" through his shootings and the longer the movie goes on, the more disbelief has to be suspended (like when him shooting 46 shots with one round of 24 shots on the stairs up, where he conveniently kills 26 people). 

How many times he was run over I did not even bother to count, because it starts to become unbelievable by the third time.

Would you consider Reeves to be worth $39.000 for each single word like ""yes"" or ""you"" he uttered ?

Sarthak Bharad,10.0,"> he's but a ghost in search of a graveyard

Marquis Vincent de Gramont

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!! PEAK !!!!!!!! CINEMA !!!!!!!!

It's been a strange year for franchise filmmaking so far. While the very consistent dissatisfaction towards the mediocre MCU got even worse with the release of **Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania** with that film being just flat-out boring and exhausting with the only saving grace being Kang, **Shazam: Fury of the Gods** being another one of DCEU projects which will soon cease to exist and **Scream VI** surprising literally everyone at being actually pretty fucking good even though it is the 6th film in a franchise following a near-dead sub-genre of slasher films, it has been quite a lot of misses for the franchises with only a few making above the cut. Therein comes along **John Wick: Chapter 4**, a film already set on an insane trajectory, wherein everyone’s favourite bruised protagonist has gotten to a supposedly even deeper tenth circle of hell when he tried to climb out of the ninth circle in the previous film.

I was a bit, just a teeny little bit disappointed by the previous film i.e. Parabellum but, after seeing this film; it is in 100 years, the one thing that all film critics are going to agree on is that John Wick: Chapter 4 truly was peak cinema. Let’s just put all our cards on the (high) table. Yes, John Wick: Chapter 4 is 169 minutes long. Any one of its many (many) set pieces contains more action all by itself than most entire movies. This thing ain’t just a chapter. It’s a whole damn book; a glorious, nightmarish, biblical compendium which contains all manners of _**ass-kickery**_ and _**gun-fu**_. I’m just gonna come out and say it. This is the best cinematic experience I’ve had in a theatre for an action film in the last decade. This film absolutely floored me. Performances? **Peak**. Cinematography? **Double Peak**. Action Set Pieces? **Triple Peak**. Ending? **GOATED FR**.

First of all, performances. If you told me 10 years ago that The Matrix films are going to remain as Keanu’s most consistent and better performances, I would’ve totally agreed with you. Cut to present day, my opinion is going to differ from yours. John Wick is officially the best and most consistent piece of his performances and this film makes that certain. Keanu is mostly silent in this film but then also you can feel everything his character is feeling at a certain moment which makes his performance all the more marvelous. He doesn’t have much dialogues in this film, probably like 15-20 lines in this film but each line is delivered in a way that John Wick (if he existed in real life) would say it. Ian McShane also gives quite a performance here. Amplifying Winston’s place as John’s father figure, he is what I would call, essentially the heart and soul of this film. Laurence Fishburne, although appears very briefly, does a good job and it’s always nice to see Neo and Morpheus just strolling around and talking. And ofcourse, I’m never going to get tired of seeing Hiroyuki Sanada in a film. He comes in, murders people left and right like a badass, and leaves like a king. The standouts to me though, are **Donnie Yen**, **Bill Skarsgård** and **Shamier Anderson**. All of these have never been introduced to the audience before this film and now that they have been, they completely steal the show. Donnie Yen essentially plays the Chinese version of daredevil who isn’t a lawyer but a hitman and doesn’t think twice before a kill. Loved him in the film and the ways Chad Stahelski (the director) uses his blindness throughout the film to show us some really interesting kills. Bill Skarsgård rises up as this franchise’s most menacing antagonist to date who will stop at nothing to get the job done. He plays a French billionaire and my god his accent is just the sexiest. The pronunciation of certain words in the French accent and his control over the table’s resources literally turned the City of Love into the City of Merciless Bloodshed. Shamier Anderson essentially plays what John Wick would’ve been in the younger days. A hitman who works for the highest payday and carries around an emotional support dog who does everything but.

Now, the cinematography. This film was a visual spectacle. Everything, and I mean everything looks perfect. There isn’t a single shot in this film that feels dimly lit or out of tone. The work on display is truly fantastic here and I was just amazed at seeing the various color palettes this film uses. This film manages to be the darkest john wick film without sacrificing visual clarity. Every frame is lit up with just the perfect amount of colours suitable for setting the mood of the scene and when that transcends into a bloody action scene, the environment does nothing but enhance the hacking and slashing. I would be surprised if the academy doesn’t nominate this film for Best Production Design or Best Cinematography because _**THIS IS ART MR. WHITE!**_ (who am I kidding, this film is just going to get ignored because it’s a huge summer blockbuster).

Where do I even begin with the action in this film. I was a bit worried as to how are they going to show me anything new after I’ve seen literally every possible fight scenario from the previous three films. I was so wrong. There isn’t much new substance here persay but the action here is so well-defined, so well-choreographed, so meticulously detailed, that you just forget that you’ve seen something like this before; and that is what great action films are supposed to do. Make you completely get immersed in the action and John Wick Chapter 4 doesn’t skip a beat.

The Ending. Ughhhhhhh. The Ending for this film might just be a masterpiece. I am not gonna spoil it for you but trust me, when you see that ending sequence begin, you will be experiencing the greatest moments of cinematic history being unfolded. It isn’t a huge CGI bombastic action set-piece, instead, it subverts your expectations and becomes something completely different yet something very familiar. A perfect end to a perfect film.

Not sure what's wrong with Keanu, but having fun making a movie and actually making something worth watching are two very different things.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,6.0,"I was looking forward to the fourth instalment of John Wick but, although I did enjoy the movie, I was also somewhat disappointed.

The movie follows the story from the previous three movies which of course means a lot of action, ass-kicking and so on and so forth.

Unfortunately this is where the problems starts. The stunts, when it comes to the amount of punishment John Wick can take, is just so far over the top that it is really, well, way too far. I mean, come one, he is thrown from building bouncing on ledges like a bloody rag-doll and just walks away. I would expect some unrealism but this is just ridiculous. It doesn’t help that the bad guys all suddenly shoot like Storm Troopers of course.

Add to that, that the script writers took a note from that lazy slob who don’t give a shit about his fans when it comes to finishing his books and kills off a lot of the likable people on regular intervals.

Then we have the ending. Yes the bad guy got what he deserved and it was a really good scene with a twist, I liked that. But then it continues to the “real” ending. Seriously? After slugging through four films we get that shitty ending?

So, bottom line, the movie was okayish but I expected quite a bit more.",2023-07-26T17:35:52.179Z,603692,2 stars,0.549115777015686

The Table has appointed the Marquis (Bill Skarsgard) to take out John permanently but, as usual, John is hard to kill. John can take a lickin' and keep on tickin' but then, everything is over-the-top so realism isn't particularly an issue like... who's gonna clean up all those bodies lying around in the Paris streets.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"This isn't so much a story about the notorious murderer, but more one of two investigative journalists who meticulously followed the case and tried to establish the truth behind these gruesome crimes. Loretta McLaughlin (Keira Knightley) was largely responsible for taking the initiative to her editor (Chris Cooper) but that published, convincing, analysis drew considerable disdain from the police and she was swiftly booted off the story. Undeterred, she persisted and ultimately with the more experienced Jean Cole (Carrie Coon) is reinstated and allowed to develop her theory that - well, maybe there isn't just one strangler! To be fair, I am not particularly well versed in the history of this, but I did find this a very dry and procedural drama that reminded me a little of ""Official Secrets"" (2019). Again, this saw Knightley in a smilier sort of role, and again delivering it very much as if it were straight off the page. There is little evidence of passion here. The tenacity and perseverance of these two women - at times putting the safety of themselves and their families on the line - isn't really captured here. It's wordy, at times a little too earnest and though it looks good it's just all a bit sterile. This is a fascinating story that looks at serial killings, copycat killings and strong investigative journalism all in the face of a rather linear (and sexist) approach taken by the authorities. It ought to be scintillating and intriguing - but this is certainly not.",2023-04-01T09:17:59.209Z,881164,3 stars,0.595065176486969

How fictional I don’t know as I haven’t read much on the fact-based side of the story. I see there is a documentary out there featuring many of the people depicted in this film version, so that might be interest to watch.

But this slice of entertainment is fast-moving and engaging so I would forgive it  for any slight lapses in accuracy. Oddly, when I first watched it the subtitles weren’t working and with all the languages and interpreting going on, it took me a while to realize I was missing dialogue I wasn’t supposed to miss, so I started over after making sure the captions were there.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,7.0,"You probably would expect a film about the origins of a simple stacking block computer game to be bland and dry, but director Jon S. Baird and writer Noah Pink give “Tetris” the glossy Hollywood treatment. The movie tells the unbelievable true story of how one of the world’s most popular video games found its way into the hands of players all over the globe. It’s a story of greed, lies, manipulation, and control, playing fast and loose with the facts in order to create an embellished espionage thriller.

After video game designer and publisher Henk Rogers (Taron Egerton) discovers TETRIS in 1988, he sees a lot of potential. Henk tracks down the inventor in the Soviet Union, Alexey Pajitnov (Nikita Efremov), hoping to become partners to bring his game to the masses. Putting everything on the line, Henk travels to Russia during the height of the Cold War and isn’t welcomed with open arms. When big money players like Nintendo and Atari get involved, his mission becomes even more complicated. Even worse, Henk attracts the attention of the shadowy KGB, who want to secure the rights to TETRIS for their home country.

The elaborate story is far-fetched and silly, and it goes to unexpected places because the history of TETRIS is turned into a crazy circus of a thriller. There are so many twists and turns that it’s exhausting to keep up, but the film keeps things interesting by raising the stakes with fictional scenarios. After all, there are only so many talky negotiations, licensing, contracts, business deals, and under the table government conversations that one can endure without a few harrowing car chases or scenes of our hero being harassed by KGB men in black. The result is a narrative that’s complicated, with everybody lying to everyone else while they argue over the rights to a computer game.

Baird’s directorial choices may feel questionable to some, but I found his use of retro 8-bit animation to tell parts of his story to be breezy and fun. There is a good sense of comedy too, which breaks up the more monotonous aspects of the movie. And while the action and thriller elements are admittedly corny, most everyone loves a story of an underdog taking down “the man” with a bit of Cold War espionage thrown into the mix.

Egerton holds much of the film together, and he gives a solid, enjoyable performance. He’s an understated actor with a ton of unexpected charisma, and he’s well-suited to the leading man role.

If you don’t know the story behind the birth of TETRIS, this film is an interesting way to get a decent outline of how it came to be. You’ll want to research what really happened, of course, and spoiler alert: you are going to be disappointed by just how much of the story as presented on screen is fiction. But if you’ve ever played one of the most addictive puzzle games in history (and even if you have not), you’ll find “Tetris” not only interesting, but a lot of fun, too.

Nathan,7.0,"Tetris, directed by Jon S. Baird, is an entertaining and fast-paced film that manages to balance a grounded story with a light tone. The screenplay is stellar, streamlined, and keeps the audience engaged throughout. Despite some old-school “America is good, Russia is bad” propaganda, which felt a little dated, the story remained engaging. However, the end of the film got a bit out there, and the car chase sequence felt a bit out of place.

In terms of performances, Taron Edgerton stood out as the lead, carrying the film with his performance. While the rest of the cast delivered fine performances, nothing was particularly memorable. Overall, the majority of the performances didn’t really add or take away anything from the film.

The direction was really well done, with the 8-bit transitions between cities and acts of the film being a standout element. However, the random eight-bit overlays on top of the picture felt a bit out of place. The 80s aesthetic was executed brilliantly, and the score and song selection were both fantastic.

In conclusion, Tetris is a good movie that offers a unique take on the iconic video game. The story, while sometimes relying on dated propaganda, manages to stay grounded and entertaining. Taron Edgerton delivers a standout performance, while the direction and score provide an engaging and nostalgic experience for viewers.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"This starts off as quite a fun look at just how ""Tetris"" made it's way from being a cheap and cheerful game played in the Soviet Union into a handheld game selling and making millions across the globe. It seems it was all spotted by opportunist ""Stein"" (Toby Jones) who managed to get it to a games exhibition where it was then picked up by the tenacious ""Hank"" (an adequate Taron Egerton) who determines to make his fortune from this block-sliding game. What now ensues is quite a frantic and at times dangerous tale of licensing, sub-licensing, risky travel, corruption, bribery, the KGB and Robert Maxwell before we arrive at the denouement that, well, that is history! I thought the Jones quite good here, as is Roger Allan as the bullish billionaire Maxwell, but much of the rest of this was all just a bit too messy. Though maybe quite informative of the vagaries of the development process, it features far too much dialogue and the intricacies of the plot are not really developed cohesively - sometimes it feels really slow, then really rushed. It's set at a time when Gorbachev's USSR was about to go the way of the dodo, and so there is some fun manoeuvring, betrayal and money-grabbing going on, but just not enough to sustain this for all but two hours.

The Movie Mob,7.0,"**Shazam! Fury of the Gods remembered everything that made its predecessor so delightful and delivered a sequel as fun as the first!**

Shazam! Fury of the Gods matches the fun of the first film while, in typical sequel fashion, increasing the action, effects, and scope of the Shazam franchise. Despite being a Shazam movie, Freddy is the primary focus of the film, which I was unsure about at first but enjoyed as the story progressed. Fury of the Gods had many more characters to juggle, leading to some of the Shazam family being sidelined and the villains being reasonably stereotypical. However, all the charm was still there, helping overshadow these flaws. Djimon Hounsou and Helen Mirren brought some maturity and class to the goofball cast, and Zachary Levi was a blast, as always. If you enjoyed the first film, you will also love Fury of the Gods.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Ok, so I know I shouldn't have - but I did enjoy this. ""Billy"" (Zachary Levi/Asher Angel) and his gang of rather hapless super-heroes locally lauded as the ""Philadelphia Fiascos"" find themselves pushed to the very limits when the daughters of the legendary ""Atlas"" manage to breach a magical boundary between their world and our's and are soon on the hunt for the magical staff that ""Billy"" snapped in two at the end of the last film (remember?). The daughters are led by the menacing ""Hespera"" (Dame Helen Mirren) with her potent sidekick ""Kalypso"" (Lucy Liu) and the slightly more humane ""Anthea"" (Rachel Zegler) making up this dangerous triumvirate. What now ensues are some genuinely entertaining set piece battles that unlike so many from the MCU, are based on creatures from mythology and do not drag on interminably. Levi is as much an anti-hero as you can imagine, his tongue firmly in his cheek - though not so much as Dame Helen's - as he and his gang look hopelessly - and continuously - outgunned, outmanoeuvred and outwitted. Can they rally and save the day before carnage ensues and mankind is wiped out? Nope, not a shred of jeopardy here - but the two hours just flew by. It's fun. It's not trying to offer us any grand philosophies, or complex time-shifting science. It's a lightly comedic adventure film that rarely stops for breath, uses state of the art special effects to enhance the story rather than dominate it, and by the end I was ready to remember why I quite enjoyed the original from 2019. All of this said, I fear they will try to squeeze a third from the franchise and think that would be an error. This works because of some charismatic performances - particularly from the rather engaging Jack Dylan Grazer as the lovestruck ""Freddy""; a great big dragon and an at times quite pithy script.

Nathan,6.0,"Shazam! Fury of the Gods is a run-of-the mill superhero sequel that doesn’t progress the genre forward, but delivers two hours of pure entertainment.

This film does not do any one thing great, but it was still a pretty decent watch. The plot is average—nothing we have not seen on the big screen before. Our villains have no development; their motivations are sound, but there is nothing further that develops them into something greater.

This movie starts off incredibly strong, with a fantastic first act that had me laughing hysterically. The comedy hits more often than not, which was a surprise for me. There is a bridge rescue scene that is electric. The combination of ""I Need a Hero"" mixed with all of the heroes showcasing their abilities was amazing. I think superhero films have dropped the ball by not showing heroes rescuing everyday people. The stakes have gotten so high outside of the everyday troubles that this art is lost. I really enjoyed that aspect of the film, but unfortunately, after the first act, this story becomes inflated to a point where it is indistinguishable from many other superhero blockbusters.

The final act is overly long and bloated with a plethora of CGI monsters for our heroes to defeat. I think the CGI actually looked pretty good, but it just was not an engaging conclusion for me. The stakes were high, but not built up properly for me to be genuinely interested. The action is pretty decent, but I couldn’t care less. The finale did have emotional beats in terms of the family connection, which worked surprisingly well. That is when this franchise works best. When the focus is on family and not on god's attempts to destroy Earth,

The performances overall were pretty good. Zachary Levi is fantastic as Shazam; he has mastered the art of playing a child in a man's body. Jack Dylan Grazer is hilarious; his comedic timing is brilliant. Grace Caroline Currey is a queen. Rachel Zegler is a standout, and her chemistry with Grazer is top notch. The rest of the Shazamly do a great job as well. I think Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu are fine as antagonists but were wasted with a lack of screen time and development.

r96sk,9.0,"I genuinely had a blast with this!

I also had much fun with the original 2019 <em>'Shazam!'</em> so I guess the aforementioned isn't too much of a surprise, though I actually think this as entertaining in differing ways... and I'd class it as an improvement. The first film is more funny, though the story and characters are more interesting here in my opinion.

Big fan of the special effects throughout, the whole look of film in general is pleasant and I like how bright it all is for the vast majority; as opposed to the dreary darkness that superhero flicks seemingly tend to bring, especially in the DCEU. The score is excellent, not necessarily one I'd add to my movie soundtrack playlist but with the context of what's onscreen it's great.

The cast bring noteworthy performances. I wouldn't actually put anyone as a true standout, naturally Zachary Levi sticks out most but as a bunch of characters I had an enjoyable time watching them all in truth. It's fun seeing Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu in their respective roles, while Rachel Zegler is a positive addition and Djimon Hounsou is pleasing. Jack Dylan Grazer spearheads the rest of them well.

The only real criticism I have is a couple of bits of dialogue, namely the product placement ones... that certain sweet brand and its slogan in particular. Otherwise, I can only say I found a lot of enjoyment with <em>'Shazam! Fury of the Gods'</em>... my favourite flick from this universe, though a quick glance at the average rating suggests I should whisper that quietly!",2023-11-18T01:58:03.435Z,594767,4 stars,0.7766706943511963
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,6.0,"Eva Longoria makes her feature film directorial debut in “Flamin’ Hot,” a breezy biopic about Richard Montanez, the man who invented the super spicy (and well known) flavor of Cheetos. This underdog story of a hardworking Mexican immigrant who found success despite all of the boxes society tried to put him in is one that’s inspiring, satisfying, and universal.

As a teenager, Montanez (Jesse Garcia) was in and out of trouble. As he puts it, “when society treats you like a criminal, you become one.” He was on the fast track to a permanent life of crime until his wife Judy (Annie Gonzalez) became pregnant with their first son. Searching for a better life for his new family, Richard relied on his street smarts and entrepreneurial attitude to go out and make his own success story. A go-getter from the start, he ended up working at Frito Lay and, after “thinking like a CEO,” came up with the idea to create a flavor that would appeal to the large Hispanic market and save the snack food industry.

It’s a terrific story that captures the Mexican-American experience that’s not often seen in mainstream films. Linda Yvette Chávez’s script feels deeply personal, and she takes Richard’s inspiring, complex story and gives us an intimate picture of the man behind the Cheetos. The result is a very human film about discrimination, determination, and the ability to get a leg up on life by pulling yourself out of a bad situation.

The story (which is actually controversial because there is a debate as to who really invented the snack flavor) is full of humor and heart. It’s a love story between Richard and Judy, his supporting, loving wife. She isn’t just a background character waiting in the shadows, but is presented as a very strong, tenacious woman who dominates every seen she’s in.

As is the case with most biopics, there’s obvious embellishment and exaggeration, and there’s no shortage of emotional fluffery that is designed to tug on your heartstrings. There’s plenty of discussion about having faith and living the American dream, which does feel as corny as it sounds.

There’s a lot of talk about representation in front of the camera, but it’s important behind the camera, too. Longoria put her money where her mouth is and hired a diverse crew for her film because who tells these stories also matters. The final product is something that radiates an authentic tone and feeling that is rare, especially for a biopic.

Longoria’s directorial style is polished and well-matched to the script, with a clear vision and voice. The cast is just as easy to love. Charismatic and sympathetic, I was rooting for Richard and Judy the minute they were introduced onscreen. Casting is so important in a film like this, and it couldn’t be more perfect.

Despite a predictable outcome and a few obvious exaggerations of the truth, “Flamin’ Hot” is an irresistible underdog story about a disruptor who shook up the snack food industry. It’s a funny, sweet, and delightful film that’s as crowd-pleasing as it gets.

The Movie Mob,8.0,"**Scream VI cranks up the violence, paranoia, and chaos but also enhances the character development and story, making the new directors' second entry even better than I had hoped!**

I have been hyped and anxiously anticipating this movie since the final moments of finishing Scream (2022) in theaters - and it did not disappoint! The Radio Silence team (Bettinnelli-Olpin and Gillett) prove they are the perfect new shepherds of the franchise. The four young survivors take giant leaps in character development as they grapple with the trauma, fallout, and spotlight of the last film's events. Their loyalty and care for each other draw immediate similarities to Sidney, Dewey, and Gale, which quickly endear the ""Core Four"" as beloved characters you desperately want to survive. The danger, kills, and gore all have been cranked up a notch, and for the first time in the franchise, even the survivors are possible Ghostfaces. I doubt and suspect everyone while simultaneously caring for them - that is masterful writing right there! On top of all that, having another legacy character back with Kirby Reed returning was fantastic. I loved this movie, but I really missed Dewey and Sidney. I also think the main Ghostface killer is a little too over the top when revealed, which keeps Scream (1996) and Scream (2022) ahead on my list. But those are incredibly minor complaints! Scream VI is another exceptional entry in the Scream franchise, and I hope we get another one soon!",2023-03-10T05:28:12.976Z,934433,4 stars,0.5904949307441711
Rela Blue Jones,-1.0,"Scream VI has the ""killer"" trademark opening kill we've all come to expect and it does not disappoint! The fresh setting (in New York City) is a welcome twist.

While it is somewhat self-referential it is not nearly as much on that vibe as Scream V. Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett are back with the same knack for set pieces but they're even stepped up their game more! Each scenario is cleverly set up for maximum suspense and tension, then pays off with buckets of blood. There's a scene set on the subway that is especially hair-raising.

The women rule here -- Melissa Barrera, Jenna Ortega, and Jasmin Savoy Brown are totally believable and likable. It just goes to show that this franchise can survive and even thrive without the legacy characters.

""Scream VI is satisfying enough as another sequel. The new location and sets bring much-needed freshness to the franchise. The killings have never been this visually violent and gory, pushing the entertainment levels of a pretty fast-paced story. Melissa Barrera proves that she's capable of leading a film of this scale, but Jenna Ortega plays in a league of her own. Unfortunately, the third act is everything that it shouldn't be: predictable, forced, underwhelming, and incapable of bringing together all its meta commentary – lacking development, or a plot. One too many inconsistencies, even for a saga known for not taking itself seriously.""

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Now I did approach this with some trepidation. I positively hated the puerile outing for ""Ghostface"" from last year. Still, it could hardly be much worse - and, as it happens, is actually really rather better. The plot still reminds me of something from an edition of ""Scooby Do"". The slasher manages to penetrate tight security; be in half a dozen places at one time; have access to secret phone numbers etc...; whilst those impaled appear to have a remarkable resilience for survival and recovery after an onslaught that would have felled an elephant. That's not the point, though. Unlike so many of the genre, this is actually quite scary and works well as a bit of a self-parody. If you've watched the others in the franchise, you will know how the dynamic plays out - and this is just an extension of that. The story doesn't really matter - it's the way in which the directors manage to imbue the whole thing with an entertaining degree of menace and paranoia, a few quite effective jump moments and by using a cast of relative non-entities (and by only using the wooden as a draining-board Courteney Cox sparingly), they manage to create a film that is actually a bit frightening at times. There are plenty of new characters for us to suspect including love interest Josh Segarra (""Danny"") - who reminded me of Christian Bale, and the rather hapless Jack Champion's (""Ethan"") before an ending that was, admittedly, quite ridiculous! This is not a film that will engage your brain on any level, but as piece of well constructed entertainment with some frequently quite witty dialogue and an eye watering encounter between a boy and a taser - it's well worth catching up with.",2023-03-23T14:33:22.637Z,934433,3 stars,0.5553764700889587
Nathan,7.0,"Scream VI is bloodier and more gruesome than its predecessor, but that does not make up for an average plot and rushed first act.

This movie is a tale of two halves for me. The first half was pretty messy, with a lot of new characters introduced and events taking place across multiple different locations. The New York setting created a multitude of interesting set pieces, but the spanning locations result in the movie being slightly unfocused at times. The film rushed through this introduction, which resulted in poor pacing. The second half was an intense, paranoia-inducing sequence that had me on the edge of my seat. As a whole, the movie worked well but could have been much better.

The best parts about Scream VI are the characters and the action. All of our returning cast is fantastic, and their chemistry works so well together. They are so great on screen that I feel as though the film does not really need the legacy characters, as they seem somewhat unnecessary. Our new cast members do fine in their roles, but they are not nearly as interesting as our core four. But that is fine in a slasher, as their role is to be carved up by Ghostface. This film is especially brutal, with some particularly gruesome kills and fantastic effects work to show the remains of our victims. There are a few kills that were top-notch and will go down as some of my favorites in the franchise. Scream VI is the first film for me that genuinely had me stressed. There are a few scenes that just linger for a moment too long and create an unsettling feeling in me that I thought worked really well. My favorite scene was the subway sequence, as my heart was pounding for genuinely two minutes straight.

Other than the rushed first act, my only complaint has to do with the ending and some of the unbelievability in terms of our cast's survival. Although I do not think the final reveal was as bad as most reviewers make it out to be, I still think it could have been slightly better. I had one killer pegged from the beginning, but the other was a surprise, so I think they did a good job keeping the audience in the dark. Our characters take quite the beating in this film, with some being stabbed nearly a dozen times and still somehow being able to survive. It isn’t a huge deal, but it did take me out of the film a bit. Also, I spent nearly ten minutes of the movie trying to figure out how the hell Kirby was alive; I could have sworn she died in Scream 4.

Overall, Scream VI was a welcomed addition to the franchise, even if it was not as good as Scream (2022). I do think my expectations were a bit high from the initial reactions, which may have led me to being slightly let down.

At the start, the main character walks up to some guy and says 'I'm gonna taze you in the balls', and does so. Instead of spending the rest of the movie in a jail cell on sexual assault charges, and then getting sued into the ground, the film just goes on. (The victim was a white male, so modern hollywood wants you to think it's 'funny' rather than disgusting.) From that point on, the main character is in no way an innocent victim, so it's hard to care that she's being pursued by a killer. The plot is mediocre, there are no funny or cool characters that the viewer might actually care about, and the killer's identity has reached the level of 'roommate's friend's brother's dogwalker', aka 'who cares'.

r96sk,6.0,"There's a good film in there, but the ultra lame characters just suck out any interest I have in <em>'Scream VI'</em>.

I felt similarly about 2022's <em>'Scream'</em>, in that the legacy ones are solid though the newcomers just lack any sort of conviction with their performances, in my eyes anyway. Jenna Ortega is the only one I named as decent in the predecessor, however even she isn't all that in this 2023 release unfortunately.

Melissa Barrera is OK but forgettable, Dermot Mulroney overacts by chewing the heck out of the scenery and the rest of the friends circle range from boring to irritating. I don't intend to hate on them too much as I actually don't dislike them, it's just they consistently stopped me from getting into the movie.

...and that's a shame, as its other elements are quite good. The visual use of Ghostface is effective, the music plays well (on that note - big fan of Demi Lovato's end credits song, as I was for last year's film from Salem in fairness... they know how to pick 'em!) and, most importantly, the kills are actually awesome; fwiw, they help boost up my rating.

The Movie Mob,6.0,"**65 had so much potential but couldn’t overcome its weird story restrictions.**

65 is not the horrible movie many recited claim it to be. It’s a decent sci-fi survival thriller with a handful of fun, suspenseful sequences but a slower pace and some strange story decisions kept the film from being the stand-out it had the potential to be. Two major writing choices held the movie back:

*SPOILERS AHEAD*

1. Killing every other person on board the ship leaving only the pilot and a nine-year-old girl to survive the dangers of prehistoric Earth minimized the threat and tension of the film. The audience reasonably assumes these two characters will survive at least to the end of the film and prevents the dangers from having any real bite (literally). Allowing for more survivors would have given more characters to fall prey to the terrors around them and raised the tension and the pace of the film.

2. Why did the writers choose to make the only two characters of the film speak two different languages? It reduced the dialogue to clunky and rudimentary exchanges that were annoying and mostly irrelevant. Having the young girl in shock and not speak at the beginning but slowly say more and more as she trusts the pilot would have been a better way to show development.

65 wasn’t a great or even a good movie, but it wasn’t bad either. I wasn’t disappointed with seeing it once on $5 Tuesday at the theater. It could have been epic, but a limiting screenplay and a lack of on-screen action prevented 65 from being anything better than decent.",2023-03-15T04:41:33.021Z,700391,3 stars,0.4646585285663605

Such a disappointing movie. Adam Driver is a great actor but this movie is so incredible boring. 90% of the movie are encounters to another and then another and then another dangerous blood seeking Dino. Just when you think the story might get anywhere there is another Dino to shoot.  Slowly you are realizing there is no more extra story. it is just a short journey to a top of a hill fighting Dino's. And Adam is a father of a 9 year old but then on this journey he has to do the journey with another 9 year old (which looks too old) and suddenly  becomes like the dumbest not able to communicate person in the world.

Peter McGinn,7.0,"This film starts out with an odd premise. Putting a twist on the Planet of the Apes plot, instead of earth astronauts ending up in the past or future of this planet, the Earth is visited by space travelers from a different planet in the distant prehistoric past. (The title is not a suggested rating for reviewers, but rather how many million years ago the story takes place.) So it is odd to contemplate that the Adam Driver character speaks Engish just so we can understand him, while his co-star speaks some other language. How different the story would have been if we understood her (Koa) and not him!

But I digress. So this turns into another Jurassic Park without the huge body count or those magic sighing moments of viewing a herd of docile grazing Brontosauruses or triceratops. Instead the dinosaurs start out as killing threats and remain so throughout. I suppose this is also a good reason to show the movie on a streaming service rather than on a large theater screen. That sort of access might have tilted the movie away from sci-if thriller and towards mere horror.

I had this weird and unrealized vision of them showing some sign of these alien visitors millions of years later along with other fossil remains, but perhaps fortunately perhaps, nothing like that developed.",2023-04-16T21:34:02.195Z,700391,3 stars,0.4975345730781555
Nathan,6.0,"Underneath poor pacing and a half-baked plot, there is a good film that, unfortunately, 65 never fully realizes.

From the start of the film, the pacing was dreadful. The introduction of our character, Mills, and the set-up to his story were rushed and for no reason, as the movie was under an hour and thirty minutes long. This time that should have been used for character development and motivation setup was fast-forwarded in order to get to the action on Earth. This section is critical to the audience's ability to relate to Mills, and unfortunately we never get to see it come to fruition.

Once we get to Earth, things start to even out as the story progresses. The world they built was breathtaking, and the visuals were stellar. The action set pieces were nothing too impressive, but they did the job and had me thoroughly entertained. But, similarly to the introduction, this section lacks heart. 65 tries to be more than just a dinosaur action flick, and attempts to develop an intimate relationship between Mills and Koa just don’t work. I think the decision to make them speak different languages really took away from their development. It always felt awkward, which is a missed opportunity for what they could have been.

Despite my story complaints, this movie was just entertaining. There were some pretty decent action scenes, Adam Driver was fantastic as always, and the overall concept was pretty unique. I loved the idea of this not being a time travel film, especially with that mixed with the extinction event of the dinosaurs. In the end, this film is not good, but it isn’t as bad as many would have you believe.

Nathan,9.0,"While Creed III may not be the best in the franchise, it brings enough creativity and passion to the table to keep the series fresh.

The Rocky/Creed franchise is at its best when the villain is just as, if not more, interesting than our protagonist, and that is not more evident than in Creed III. Damien Anderson (expertly played by Jonathan Majors) is a very sympathetic antagonist that has a direct connection with Adonis Creed’s past. This connection is at the forefront of the conflict as Creed tries to reconcile with his past mistakes while also being true to his present self. This back and forth is excellently done and evolves Creed further as a boxer and a man. I really enjoyed this story overall, and while it may not be the most unique script to hit the silver screen, it does enough to differentiate itself from the rest of the Rocky universe, and I can respect that.

The acting in this film is excellent, as it has been in previous Creed films. I thought that there might be a hole left by the absence of Sylvester Stallone, but I really did not notice it at all. Michael B. Jordan is able to get the best out of the entire cast, and everyone is better than ever. Tessa Thompson is fantastic; her chemistry with Jordan is incredible. The addition of their daughter creates a very wholesome family dynamic. Jonathan Majors is superb; he is intimidating, tragic, and full of emotion that the audience can genuinely resonate with. His anger is justified, and his portrayal of this angry kid who had his life taken from him is incredibly genuine. He was one of the best parts of the film.

With Michael B. Jordan behind the camera, this film has the most unique cinematography in the entire series. Jordan takes some liberties with the material that came before to deliver a modern spin on the boxing genre. Where previous films tried to have a broadcast experience grounded in grit and realism, Creed III turns that on its head, delivering the most stunning action scenes I have ever seen. The anime inspiration is apparent, with slow motion used sparingly but effectively. The finale fight has some very creative choices that create an intimate connection between our two leads that is a great backdrop to not only the fight but the story as a whole.

Overall, I had an excellent time watching Creed III. Michael B. Jordan had a wonderful directorial debut, creating a film that left me with a huge smile on my face.

garethmb,-1.0,"Life for Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan), is going well. He has a loving

Creed spends his time with his family and developing young fighters at his

Viktor Drago.

An unexpected figure from Creed’s past arrives in the form of Damian
Anderson (Jonathan Majors), a friend of Creed’s troubled youth has
just completed eighteen years in prison.

Damian was the current Golden Gloves champion when he was arrested and
believes he is due his title shot and Creed is the one who can make it
happen.

Creed tries to teach his friend that a person without a single professional fight does not get a magical title shot and with his large
the gap from the ring he would need to grind it out to get a shot.

When an incident occurs just before a scheduled fight and without any
established fighters available to make the date of the fight, Creed gives
his friend a shot and sees that his brutal style of boxing is not what he
would endorse.

Upon winning the title Damian lets it go to his head and gloats at how Creed
had the life he should have had and blames Creed for his past issues and
for not visiting him or staying in contact.

Naturally, this puts the two former friends on a path of no return with a
climatic boxing match being the solution.

“Creed III” does not have the benefit of Sylvester Stallone but you can
still get whips of his character’s influence on Creed and Jordan does a
very solid job Directing the film. He produces strong character moments
which help define the struggles and motivations that each of them faces and
the boxing sequences are very engaging and will have you cheering along.

Majors does a great job in what could have been a routine bad guy
performance. He gives Damian a drive and purpose but also shows the path
that Creed could easily have followed had fate not gone as it did and how
watching someone get everything you dreamed of while you are in prison can
turn even the best of a man cold and bitter.

The film satisfies from start to finish and the character moments and
boxing blend to make not only a very enjoyable film but one that shows
that there is plenty of life in the franchise.

Leaving, one afternoon, he discovers a guy sitting on his car and after a quick chat realises that it's his long-lost childhood pal who has been incarcerated for the last eighteen years. He (""Damian"") is now determined to succeed in the ring and so his friend tries to sort it all out - only to discover that this lean, mean, fighting machine has an altogether different agenda and that is going to force the former champ to prove whether or not he still has what it takes. The story is an hybrid of too many others and plays out as predictably as the sun coming up. Add to the mix a degree of familial discord and melodrama and we are left with something largely forgettable that I found to be a pretty poor relation of the previous, much more charismatic and grittier efforts in this franchise.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,7.0,"When it comes to boxing movies, it can sometimes feel like there are few stories left to be told. What works so well about “Creed III” is that instead of being a laser-focused sports story, co-writers Keenan Coogler and Zach Baylin‘s script leans heavily into a sincere family drama. It’s also a solid directorial debut from actor Michael B. Jordan, who reprises his role as the title character.

Adonis Creed (Jordan) has retired from sparring in the ring. After amassing dozens of titles, he’s now a devoted husband to Bianca (Tessa Thompson) and father to Amara (Mila Davis-Kent), a loving son to Mary-Ann (Phylicia Rashad), and runs a successful boxing gym where he works with the latest and greatest talent in the sport. Things are going well until his former childhood friend Damian (Jonathan Majors) resurfaces after nearly two decades in prison, and a long-buried incident (which is eventually revealed) causes tension between them. Eager to prove himself and get the boxing career he always wanted, Damian asks Adonis if he can help get him a shot in a fight. Feeling guilty, he agrees. Damian is a skilled but dirty fighter, which creates even more problems. Things go from bad to worse, with an eventual title fight between the two men.

The fight scenes are well directed and exciting, even if they are predictable. The film expects the audience to know the general rules of boxing so if you have no idea what’s an illegal or legal hit, you may be in over your head. (I have next to zero knowledge of the sport but I still enjoyed the fight scenes).

The film’s strongest element is the robust character development, which has always been a huge part of the franchise. Learning the painful history between Adonis and Damian makes their narrative of friends turned adversaries even more compelling, and there are genuinely touching moments featuring Bianca, Amara, and Mary-Ann. The chemistry and talent of the cast are both terrific.

That being said, there is a lot of story here. A lot. It makes much of the film feel too hurried as Jordan rushes through scene after scene. It’s good that the movie isn’t draggy, but this is a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it type of project. And although the characters and their relationships are detailed, parts of the script feel hollow and of course, predictable.

For the third film in a franchise, “Creed III” is far better than reasonably expected. Despite a few stumbles, the strong performances, the compelling story, and themes of perseverance and the importance of family make this one a winner.

I do enjoy these <em>'Rocky'</em>/<em>'Creed'</em> flicks, they always tend to bring enjoyable performances and excellent fight scenes - and <em>'Creed III'</em> delivers in those aspects, alongside others. It is a shame, though, that they couldn't get Sylvester Stallone involved here.

In fairness, however, I wouldn't necessarily say the film is weaker or anything without Stallone - it just would've been nice to see him reprise his role, that's all. Cast-wise, it is as strong as you would expect. Michael B. Jordan is impressive, while Tessa Thompson is good (if somewhat underused). It's a shame that Jonathan Majors has ruined his own career off reel because that guy has quite the screen presence, hey-ho!

I'm kinda interested in further installments, though at the same time it would be good if they kept this as a three-film thing.

""We Have a Ghost holds a fun concept and a charming cast, but Christopher Landon disappoints with a disjointed, overlong, easily forgettable story. The incessant attempts to approach various subject matters through different genres destroy a screenplay that garnered attention for the simplicity of its premise, but which ends up becoming an unnecessarily complex mess without any idea of what it wants to be. Wasting David Harbour as a non-speaking ghost is one of many questionable creative decisions in this hard-to-remember Netflix film.""

CinemaSerf,5.0,"I loved the first television series of this gritty and challenging police drama. Sadly, now we have reached a nadir for this charismatic and unorthodox character. The story is so ridiculously far-fetched that it reminded me of something Mark Gatiss might have written for ""Sherlock"" before he watched ""No Time To Die"" (2021) and thought - nah! It all starts when youngster ""Callum"" is dragged away from his night-time cleaning job by a mysterious phone call. Next thing we know, ""Luther"" (Idris Elba) is at a crime scene with no sign of the boy but with a victim in her car that has been missing for ages. Enter the completely un-menacing ""Robey"" (Andy Serkis) and pretty soon our favourite policeman is incarcerated for a career of systematic rule-bending/breaking and this rather evil monster now proceeds to prove that evil can prevail - and on a fairly spectacular scale. This story is, frankly, preposterous and as the film lumbers along for over two ours I really struggled to remain engaged as it moved from suicide scenarios to far more brutal killings - but what, exactly, is motivating this man is anyone's guess. He appears to have acquired control over a vast network of technology and people to effect his dastardly plan but none of that even vaguely rings plausible. The last twenty minutes are just plain silly and overall, the writing is all rather poor: ""They'll kill you John"" - ""I can live with that!"" - not an hint of irony there, neither. This is a pretty shameless attempt to capitalise on a strong character made memorable by a charismatic actor and a series of solid stories. This film has thrown all of those under the snowplough.",2023-02-28T10:15:22.016Z,722149,2 stars,0.6339762210845947

To be frank, the back story is absurdly far fetched but somehow it ""works"". In essence, I'd describe it as a pastiche, of borrowed elements, from the series, that have been thrown together, in an inexplicable, crime mash up. 

Its cause is helped in no small part, by Idris Elba, whose talent outshines  and out paces, this flawed tale. Elba breathes life into a story, that might not have fared so well, with a lesser actor, in the lead.

Took me way too long to get this watched, been on my immediate watchlist ever since its release well over a year ago; in fairness, I was avoiding Netflix due to their prices, but got a good deal with 'em atm. This is classed as a crime thriller and it certainly thrilled me, I had a great time with it. Really enjoyed seeing the story come together.

Sometimes these sorta movies show 'the event' super early on and just drag out the cat and mouse 'when will they catch them' act for pretty much the whole run time. Now, don't get me wrong, of course it is a cat and mouse thing of sorts still, but I rate how there are events constantly throughout which keeps elevating the threat; the plot always felt fresh to me whilst viewing, which is a major plus.

Given I'm a big fan of the television show that this follows, it is no surprise to say that Idris Elba is one of my favourite actors - the guy is phenomenal, I won't hear otherwise. He is fantastic all the way through <em>'Luther: The Fallen Sun'</em>. Away from the lead, Andy Serkis is menacingly excellent, they sure made his character the worst of the worst! Cynthia Erivo and Dermot Crowley lead the rest very well.

Nathan,5.0,"After the initial hit of Cocaine Bear, the film left me scratching for something a little stronger.

I think the main drawback of this film is that it is trying to do too much. There are seven to eight characters introduced throughout the course of the film, with each given significant time to develop their story and motivations. This takes a lot of time away from the main attraction, the cocaine bear. There is a period of almost 45 minutes where we are focused on these ""secondary"" characters, without any action or appearance of the cocaine bear. This section was pretty slow paced and started to lose me, but once the bear is re-introduced, the film gets significantly better. The paramedic scene was superb.

The comedy was pretty lackluster as well. The entire theater was laughing aloud, but I found myself only chuckling at a few jokes. This left the script feeling somewhat bland. But the lack of humor is made up for by the absolute brutality on display. There are some really messed up kills that do not shy away from the blood and gore. Some of the effects looked to be prosthetics as well, which always have an especially disgusting appearance to them.

The story overall was pretty decent, but the ending was atrocious and incredibly predictable. I found that it was really over the top and cheesy, but not in a good way. 

The visual appearance of the bear was pretty solid. The CGI was done well but is spotty in a couple of scenes. Overall, I was slightly entertained by this film, but I can't help but feel it did not live up to its full potential.

The Movie Mob,6.0,"**Cocaine Bear delivers ridiculous creature violence on some goofy, short-lived characters, but its lack of consistent tone and identity kept it from being everything I had hoped.**

Let’s start with this: I am a massive fan of lane creature movies - Ghost Shark, Sharknado, Lavalantula, The Sand - some of my favorites. So I expected to love Cocaine Bear. Sadly, I was a little underwhelmed. It wasn’t bad for what it was, but it didn’t dazzle me as I had hoped. Two things held it back for me:

1. The tone inconsistently switched from a Zombieland-style ridiculous violence to a goofy crime movie to an odd family drama. Cocaine Bear had a minor identity crisis from start to finish.

2. The movie tried to give each character a little backstory and development. While this is generally a good thing, in a low-budget creature movie, it slows down the nonsensical violence that the audience came for in the first place. Spend time on one or two characters but not all of them. I didn’t need to know about the drug lord’s grandson or the detective’s dog. I just need to see more people get eaten 😆.

I appreciated the larger-budget kills and the oddball characters. If it continues, I will come back for a second try in this franchise, but ultimately I wasn’t high on Cocaine Bear (get it? 😜).",2023-03-16T20:28:13.170Z,804150,3 stars,0.49701356887817383

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,4.0,"There’s a bear high on mass quantities of illegal drugs that is going on a murderous rampage in a Tennessee state park in “Cocaine Bear,” an absolutely awful action / horror movie from director Elizabeth Banks. I understand with a premise like that, it’s supposed to be stupid. The problem is that the movie isn’t just dumb, it’s actually bad, with poor direction, acting, CGI, writing, and storytelling.

Loosely based on true events (yes, really), the film is inspired by the 1985 story of a drug runner’s plane crash. In order to save a large quantity of cocaine, the man threw out several duffel bags full of the stuff over Tennessee and then jumped to his death when his parachute didn’t open. A black bear got into the drugs, consumed most of it and, according to experts, immediately died. This movie imagines what could have happened if the bear didn’t die from ingesting all that booger sugar. In this bloody and gory version, the 500 pound apex predator goes bananas and kills everyone in sight.

It’s a fictional story that is stretched too thin, especially with the meager subplots about a single mom (Keri Russell), her missing daughter (Brooklynn Prince) and friend (Christian Convery), a group of criminals (Ray Liotta, O’Shea Jackson Jr., Alden Ehrenreich), two park rangers (Margo Martindale, Jesse Tyler Ferguson), a police detective (Isiah Whitlock Jr.), and random tourists and teenagers that must think on their toes in order to avoid being the bear’s next victim. Jimmy Warden‘s script is atrocious because he’s trying to force a story that’s not at all compelling nor complex. The actors give clunky performances and character-wise, there just isn’t a whole lot to root for.

Banks isn’t the most skilled director, and a film like this certainly doesn’t demand a whole lot of talent behind the camera. But there’s something that consistently feels “off” with her style and tone, especially in the random, mostly unsuccessful jokes. The humor didn’t work for me at all, and when I did muster a laugh, I wasn’t doing so because the movie was good — I was laughing because the movie was so dumb. I understand that a movie about a huge bear ingesting a bounty of blow is supposed to be dumb, but it also has to be good in order to work, and this movie is not.

To become a cult classic, a movie must be one that you’d want to watch on repeat. “Cocaine Bear” is simply not funny enough, not campy enough, and not kooky enough to succeed. It’s nothing but a one-joke trainwreck.

Wuchak,4.0,"**_Not funny enough as a comedy and too silly to take serious_**
 
In 1985, several bags of cocaine fall from a drug smuggling plane in the mountainous area of northern Georgia and eastern Tennessee. Near Blood Mountain, a mother black bear eats a lot of the cocaine and goes on a bloody spree as it menaces hikers, rangers, thugs, EMTs and cops.

“Cocaine Bear” (2023) is a campy creature feature inspired by the true story directed by, of all people, Elizabeth Banks. It was Ray Liotta’s second to last movie before his death on May 26, 2022. Keri Russell is on hand as the concerned mother of a tween hiker. In real-life the black bear weighed 175 lbs, but this was changed to almost 400 lbs for the movie.

The production unbelievably cost $35 million. I say “unbelievably” because this is a decidedly throwaway creature feature of the semi-goofy SyFy variety. The CGI is a little superior, but not enough to make any appreciable difference. I’m speaking as someone who enjoys some of the better SyFy flicks on occasion. A good example is “Sasquatch Mountain” (2006), aka “Devil on the Mountain,” which only cost $800,000.

Except for the lush scenery (shot in Ireland, locations listed below), this is decent but generally meh. It’s not humorous enough as a comedy, but you can’t take it serious either because it’s too goofy. It doesn’t help that Keri is the only female worth mentioning (as a footnote at that).

How this garnered as much attention as it did is a great mystery. “Grizzly Park” (2008) treaded similar terrain and, while far from a great movie, is more entertaining than this (at a fraction of the budget). 

The film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot south of Dublin, Ireland, in Barnaslingan, Powerscourt and, further south, Avoca.

taken her father’s company to new heights and they have managed to blend
their personal and professional lives and enjoy a very happy life.

Scott does worry about his daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton) as he lost

Pym technology.

Cassie is constantly on her father for not doing more as she feels that he
is more focused on the past battles with the Avengers and not the day to
day struggles people are facing. Over dinner, she tells Hope and her dad as
well as Hank (Michael Douglas), and Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), whom she
studied Hank’s journals while they were in the Blip and has developed a
Quantum beacon which can map the Quantum Realm without having to venture
to the sub-atomic relay where until recently nobody had been able to
return from.

This news sends Janet into a panic during a demonstration and the four are
soon sucked into the realm and discover a diverse and thriving ecosystem
as well as an abundance of strange and dangerous creatures.

Janet is clearly hiding something and is frantic that they must leave but
their party has been scattered and they soon learn that she fears and
individual known as Kang (Jonathan Majors).
While she was trapped in the realm for thirty years, Janet encountered
King and helped him regain his power source but in doing so, learned he
was a banished conquerer who can manipulate time, space, and the
multiverse.

Her actions to trap Kang and lead a resistance to the vast empire he
created has set the stage as Janet has now returned to see what has
developed and Kang will stop at nothing to regain his power source to
escape and wreck his wrath on trillions.

Naturally, it is up to Scott, Hope, and the team to find a way to fight the
evil and powerful Kang to save the day.

The film is a darker tale than people might expect from an Ant-man movie
but in kicking off Phase 5 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the movie is
a visual splendor filled with amazing visuals, landscapes, and characters.

The film takes a bit of time to get to the action but when it arrives it
delivers and the performance of Majors as Kang is captivating it will
be interesting to see where the storyline evolves over the next series of
films leading up to “The Avengers: The Kang Dynasty” and beyond.

“Ant-man and the Wasp: Quantumania may not break loads of new ground in
terms of a Marvel film but Director Peyton Reed knows the characters well
and delivers a story that should resonate with the fans and the strong
cast and addition of Majors along with the great visuals make this
another winner for Marvel.

Nathan,5.0,"I was really excited for this film; the trailers made the stakes seem high with a story that was somewhat mature in tone. Unfortunately, I was ultimately let down.

The overarching plot was pretty good. I liked the arcs our characters had, particularly Scott and Cassie Lang. But the minor details are where things get messy. We get introduced to so many new characters, concepts, and story details in the quantum realm, resulting in an overall film that is not very digestible. There is too much going on and not enough time to fully flesh out the details.

The dialogue is pretty poorly written. At some points in the film, I was literally laughing out loud at what the characters were saying. It felt exactly like a TikTok skit exaggerating and mocking superhero movies. Cassie Lang has one line that is probably THE MOST CRINGY LINE EVER SPOKEN IN THE MCU.

The performances were decent overall. Most of the acting in the Ant-Man films is a little cheesy and campy, which mostly works in the small-scale stories they tell. But with the large, expanding story that the film is attempting to deliver, it just felt cheap. Kang is really amazing. Jonathan Majors was a tier above the rest of the cast; I can't wait to see more of him but also feel like he was wasted here.

Finally, the visuals were really inconsistent. Some scenes looked quite good, with interesting and detailed settings, while others clearly featured three characters standing in front of a green screen. I mean, in some scenes I swear I could see slight black outlines from the keying technology. Where is the budget going in these films? They really need to slow down in postproduction because this is becoming a major theme. One thing I will note is that I thought MODOK looked really good. It was always going to be difficult to pull off a live action version of him, but they did a stellar job.

Overall, I am pretty disappointed in the movie, but the movie gave me enough to make this a somewhat average experience. The MCU needs to pick it up this year because it is on a major downward trajectory.

Quantumania threw Ant-Man into an outrageous world, changing him from the zany character of the film to the normal character and stripping him of some of his charm. Quantumania felt like a cross between Thor: Ragnarok and Rise of Skywalker with some Power Rangers sprinkled in there, and the result was… decent. It really wasn't a bad movie. It has some funny parts and was better than most of Phase 4. Bill Murray was loads of fun for his brief part and Jonathan Majors is going to be an awesome big bad in the MCU.

You certainly developed the piece of communications kit that lands everyone in the quantum soup, but the blame really must go to Peyton Reed and Jeff Loveness for directing and writing this latest emanation from Marvel's increasingly un-special film factory. It starts off with a great little device that could quickly put Papa John's out of business before we are sucked into the cantina from ""Star Wars"" (1977) where our recently arrived travellers find themselves pursued by the ridiculously un-menacing ""M.O.D.O.K"" - a sort of robotic killing version of the golden statue from the top of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) after it had had a good time with ""V.I.N.C.E.N.T"" from ""The Black Hole"" (1979) - before Michelle Pfeiffer ""Janet"" explains to her family (and to us) just what has led them to a predicament where they must avoid the evil clutches of ""Kang the Conqueror"" (Jonathan Majors). Now this gift that keeps on giving for this studio never struggles to impress visually, and the imagination of those who create these magical effects and alien shapes and sizes must be commended. However, this latest offering featuring, in my view, the weakest of their arsenal of characters is just entirely derivative and unremarkable. Aside from a very few bon-mots from Paul Rudd the dialogue is dry and the action scenes are all concentrated in one or two sequences whilst the rest of this serves as little better than colourful padding for the thinnest of storylines. Rudd is quite an unassuming kind of actor. Engaging, yes - but somehow just too lightweight for the grandness of the surrounding imagery. Michael Douglas (""Pym"") features sparingly and the cameo from Bill Murray might have worked better in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" - here it is almost laughable. If these are to keep coming off the production line as thickly and quickly as seems likely, then somebody somewhere is going to have to spend much more effort on developing stronger and more compelling stories because the audiences are surely immune to the vibrancy of the special effects by now. This is really forgettable fayre.",2023-02-23T23:22:55.565Z,640146,2 stars,0.5649160146713257
r96sk,9.0,"A fun one!

I had a terrific time watching <em>'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania'</em>, despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.

Star of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in <em>'Ant-Man and the Wasp'</em>, but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.

Love the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M.O.D.O.K. is a lot of fun.

Looking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking.",2023-03-15T16:41:38.033Z,640146,4 stars,0.7865283489227295

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,3.0,"When it comes to their Marvel properties, there’s this slightly morbid insistence by Disney to tie every teeny tiny detail of previous movies, television shows, and character arcs together in obsessive fashion. It’s becoming such an uncontrollable urge by the studio to engage in this behavior that the cause-and-effect is resulting in disasters like “Eternals,” “Thor: Love and Thunder,” and now, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.”

Trying too hard to force a non-story into the already lame Ant-Man mythology, the film reunites superhero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) as Ant-Man and the Wasp. The pair find themselves thrust into the dangerous Quantum Realm along with Hope’s parents Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), along with Scott’s teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). As they explore the unusual terrain and alien society filled with strange creatures, Janet reveals that she didn’t quite tell the group everything about the three decades she spent trapped in the realm. Facing new dangers from supervillan Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors), the family must unite to stop a worldwide disaster.

Very little about this project feels like a satisfying superhero movie and instead, it’s more like an assemblage of other (and far better) science fiction films. If not for the titanic budget and big-name stars, it could almost be mistaken for a Redbox “mockbuster” of “Star Wars,” “Mad Max,” “Avatar,” and “Godzilla” combined.

The film takes place extensively in the Quantum Realm, which provides an unsightly setting of muted, dark brown, washed-out visuals. It’s an ugly place, so who why would audiences want to spend time there? The Realm is a melting pot of exotic creatures and peculiar inhabitants that appear to have waltzed right out of the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine. They’re cool to look at I guess, but was the point to make the film more appealing to children, or was it Disney’s way of appeasing the animators by letting them have some fun?

The first third of the film seems like it’s Janet’s show, as she keeps bringing up the fact that she has all these secrets that she won’t spill to Hope and Hank (even though they’re all stuck in the Realm together). There’s no compelling mystery nor reveal. Screenwriter Jeff Loveness is grasping at straws to craft a somewhat cohesive story while also struggling to make it fit into the MCU mythology. At some point, I wish someone would just make a damn standalone Marvel superhero movie and quit worrying about who and what goes where and how.

The story is frequently erratic. There’s plenty of energetic CGI action, but there also some moments that play like a touching family drama, some that create an anti-climatic post-apocalyptic narrative, and lots of failed attempts at comic relief. The film also has recurring (and awkward) socially conscious messaging that doesn’t entirely feel out of place, but it is aggressive (there’s even a direct mention of socialism by one of the characters, which will really aggravate already-angry conservatives).

The screenplay is peppered with dreadful one-liners like “it’s never too late to stop being a dick!” and “ants don’t give up!” I really, really wish I was joking about this.

The remainder of the movie features a lot of talk about time, the desire to get home, and — Marvel fans, you know what’s coming — the multiverse! It’s that one little word that means endless movies, endless stories, and endless money. It’s also the easy way to guarantee that all of these films in the canon always have a cop-out to lazily excuse away any inconsistencies (not that many of us could keep up or remember anyway).

Another major problem with the film is that it can only chug along on Rudd’s likeability (and the cast’s talent) for so long. It’s barely tolerable until Kang shows up, but he’s a wickedly delicious character portrayed by a terrific actor (it’s a real shame that this had to be the film for Majors’ MCU debut). In fact, the entire cast deserves better. Despite all of them turning in strong performances, they still feel mostly wasted here.

“Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” lacks the memorable spectacle that most superhero films need in order to succeed. There’s no massively rousing, crowd-pleasing moment, and it’s one of the more unremarkable entries in the MCU.

Peter McGinn,6.0,"Okay, there are a plethora of reviews here by Marvelettes and more, so I will only give my gut response. Perhaps this movie was doomed to disappoint me, because Ant Man is still my favorite Marvel film of all for its wit and humor. That humor grew out of his interaction with his daughter and other people. This movie removes him to a strange complex world that struck me as a cross between the bar in Star Wars and the deserts of Dune. He was out of his element with his grown daughter and now-aged  cohorts and it left me rather bored, surprisingly. But without my baggage, I am sure others enjoyed it immensely.",2023-04-26T20:33:59.430Z,640146,3 stars,0.7566759586334229

Per Gunnar Jonsson,8.0,"This one was quite good actually. Marvel is quite a bit of hit and miss lately. It all depends on whether one of the woke retards has gotten their grubby hands on the script or not.

It was of course encouraging that the woke “critics” on the well known rubbish site Rotten Tomatoes declared it rotten while it got a 82% score from the actual audience. Always a good sign for a movie.

The movie is a pure adventure movie meant to entertain the audience. The script is decent and, as usual with a Marvel movie, serves mainly to create a reason for doing action sequences and lots and lots of special effects.

The adventure is mixed in with some humor but it is generally okay and not overdone.

The scenery in the quantum world is fantastic and the creatures are great ranging from terrifying to quite fun. Bringing in Bill Murray was a nice surprise even though he was a bit of a bad guy and quite short lived.

The one character I really didn’t like was Paul Rudd as the Ant-Man. His anti-hero bullshit, reluctance to fight and generally being a douche until he was forced to actually do what was right was really grating on me.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Matt Johnson's rather John McEnroe-esque ""Doug"" rather stole this tale of what was literally a tech-tonic shift in how we used our mobile phones. He, together with his boss Mike (Jay Baruchel), has been working with a small team of geeks to develop a mobile word processor that can send messages by text and email. It's funding they lack and it's during a fairly flawed presentation that they encounter ""Jim"" (Glenn Howerton), a savvy operator who knows just enough about the business to get them that elusive big deal. Thing is, they don't think they have the processing capacity to service this ever increasing share of the market even if their new pal is generating eye-watering business opportunities. A 46% market share of what became the exponentially burgeoning smartphone market offered them real potential to dominate for years - but history tells us just what did happen. This film benefits from not really having a big star at the helm. The three men juggle the pressures, successes and failures delivering a solid and at times quite funny story of the rise and falls of a company that, when faced with difficulties, resorted to an emergency movie night! It doesn't shy away from depicting some of the sharper practices at play in this supremely competitive business, but it delivers in a far less aggressive fashion. Maybe it's a Canadian thing, but I found myself actually wanting them to succeed (even if I actually ended up loathing my own ""Crackberry""). So many of these true stories are based on characters seeking easy money - this is based on a pair of guys who actually made something; and something that set a benchmark for kit we all use across the world without a second thought nowadays. Enjoyable to watch and worth two hours of your time.",2023-10-19T17:01:38.115Z,1016084,4 stars,0.4392041563987732
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,-1.0,"“Blackberry” is a film about the failure and spectacular collapse of the world’s first smart phone. Adapting Jacquie McNish and Sean Silcoff’s book “Losing the Signal: The Untold Story Behind the Extraordinary Rise and Spectacular Fall of BlackBerry” for the screen, director Matt Johnson creates an entertaining look at contemporary history with his tale of the rise and fall of a revolutionary gadget that changed the world forever.

In this unconventional story of modern business failure at the hands of fraud and greed, the film tells the history of Mike Lazaridis (Jay Baruchel) and Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton), the two men responsible for the creation and marketing of the BlackBerry smart phone. It was one of the first of its kind, featuring a pocket device (with a keyboard) that could be used for calls, texts and e-mail messaging. It was a revolutionary idea that was dismissed by many of the major players, until Balsillie saw a massive opportunity in the product and the nerdy co-founders of the company. Lazaridis and his partner Doug (Johnson) lacked business savvy and the know-how to deal with the sharks who dominated the world of corporate technology, and Balsillie became the pitbull they needed to whip the business into shape and bring in the discipline needed to run a tight, successful company.

The film takes viewers through the BlackBerry timeline from concept to eventual defeat, starting in 1996 up until 2016. The mid-nineties seems like a time that was so far away, but it wasn’t that long ago. (Being transported back to a world without a smart phone in every pocket is nearly unimaginable nowadays). The film has a retro look and feel that’s very corporate and drab, which is a great fit for the material, and Johnson’s storytelling is comprehensive but always entertaining, with a good mix of business-oriented drama and light comedy.

The most interesting parts of the story are when PalmPilot CEO Carl Yankowski (Cary Elwes) hints at a hostile takeover, but Balsillie outthinks him by launching a grassroots marketing campaign that made the Blackberry a highly sought after status symbol. He saved the company, which makes for an eventual bittersweet demise. On the other hand, he also directly led to its end with some shady stock manipulation that got him in trouble with the SEC.

The film is well cast with standout work from Baruchel, especially when he begins to crack with the realization that Apple is getting ready to kill his invention and his company with their upcoming iPhone, a product with the highest consumer interest of any item in history. The characters are flawed human beings (and in the case of Balsillie, a total jerk), but they aren’t impossible to root for.

Ultimately a reflection on failure, “BlackBerry” is an interesting and fun film about the competitiveness of Silicon Valley and the men who made some massive mistakes on their journey to the top. Their position at the highest rung of the tech world was brief, crippled by the innovators at Apple.

kisaligol,4.0,"The script seems to be written mostly from the perspective of Jim Balsillie, a businessman that was co-CEO of Blackberry, while engineers take a backseat. This follows the general tendency in film to glorify businessmen, treating the people who actually conceptualize, design and implement the products (i.e., do the core work that is societally useful) as mere sidekicks.

The general timeline is right and many of the major events in the history of Blackberry are there, but none are described in enough detail for viewers to appreciate the engineering successes that led to Blackberry rising to global prominence, nor the business mismanagement that tanked it.

The engineering details that made it in are often confused or misleading (e.g., Blackberry did not invent push messaging, and their prototype wasn't pulled from thin air overnight). It gives the impression most of the source material came from interviews with non-technical people, or else ""Great Man"" personality drama was the only material the filmmakers understood well enough to put in a script.

The film has confusingly mixed messaging. It perpetuates the notion that engineers are tinkering children that get nothing done without big daddy managers pushing them to work long hours and ""just make it work"", damn the technical details! Yet it repeatedly also tries to show the businessmen as hustlers that use bluster and hand waving to cover up their general uselessness and technical incompetence, as well as the resulting harmful decisions they make that ultimately resulted in the downfall of Blackberry. Perhaps the writers wanted to portray Balsillie as a clever shark, but based on his actions in the film alone you would think he was largely a egomaniacal leech that the meek engineers could not figure out how to get rid of. Indeed it is unclear why the engineers brought him on to begin with - they probably would have been better off without him and the other businessmen he brought on.",2024-01-01T05:44:47.298Z,1016084,2 stars,0.43226873874664307

Brent Marchant,6.0,"With the release of such innovative communications products as the Apple and Android smartphones, questions began to circulate about the future viability of onetime market leader BlackBerry, a line of devices that subsequently went into rapid decline. Ironically, that real-life business world narrative itself raises comparable questions about the viability of a movie that tells the BlackBerry story. Nevertheless, writer-director Matt Johnson’s third feature outing brings the ill-fated account of the rise and fall of this Canadian-made smartphone company in the global telecommunications marketplace. Seeing how the company was run, however, it probably shouldn’t come as any surprise why it ultimately failed – shady financial management, ego-driven unbridled greed, undisciplined employees and constant managerial scrambling to remain competitive, despite some surprisingly savvy marketing aimed at making the BlackBerry an enviable status symbol, especially among business clients. But is this kind of material really sufficiently engaging for a feature film? I sure don’t think so, especially since it’s about a company and product that ultimately flopped. It’s a cinematic exercise akin to “The Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight” (1971) trying to take on Silicon Valley giants. The film also gets exceedingly technical at times, making for a film that cyber nerds may find awesomely cool but that casual viewers are likely to see as tedious and confusing. And, by the picture’s second half, with the handwriting on the wall and the parade of unending snafus continuing, it’s difficult to maintain interest in how events unfold and eventually play out. To its credit, this release features some fine performances, most notably by Saul Rubinek, Michael Ironside and Independent Spirit Award nominee Glenn Howerton, as well as an excellent and often-ironic soundtrack. However, in a larger sense, “BlackBerry” also represents a somewhat disconcerting trend in movies that’s gaining traction – films based on the back stories of products and businesses. Besides this offering, 2023 also saw the release of films about sneakers (“Air”), videogame retailing (“Dumb Money”) and even snack foods (“Flamin’ Hot”). While there’s nothing inherently wrong with pictures about business and commerce, these offerings are innately little more than two-hour feature-length commercials for their wares. Indeed, are these commodities becoming our new screen idols? It calls to mind actor Paul Newman’s observation years ago about the emergence of a robot and a shark becoming our new movie icons, but, as different as they were, even they weren’t as shamelessly commercial as these new contenders are. Releases like this should indeed give us all pause to think about what kinds of movies we want to plunk down our hard-earned money to watch.",2024-02-22T02:39:45.248Z,1016084,2 stars,0.4147525429725647

Jay Baruchel is excellent throughout, so is Glenn Howerton. The whole cast do good work, amusing to see SungWon Cho (aka ProZD) appear too!

Nathan,6.0,"Sharper is a crime drama that follows four individuals involved in conspiracy, theft, and betrayal.

The plot follows a disjointed structure, where you spend four chapters with each of our main characters at different times in their lives. I really enjoyed this aspect as it made the narrative non-linear, forcing the audience to try to piece together the mystery as well as the chronological order of the film. This allure began to wear off after the third scene change, as it became quite predictable.

Our performances were pretty solid all around. Sebastian Stan is really good, and I am quite enjoying him in these more villainous roles, similar to his role in Fresh. Julian Moore and Briana Middleton were both highlights as well, their emotional range is fantastic. Justice Smith was okay at best.

Overall, this movie was an okay watch. It was paced pretty well for a two-hour runtime and had a lot of twists and turns throughout, even though the premise runs its course to absolute predictability by the third act.

This offers very little of that, even at the end - and as such the thing struggles to engage. There are the odd moments that raise a smile, but Hayek overacts dreadfully and Tatum spends too much of his time standing around with his hands in his pockets as both deliver a rather strained and contrived dialogue.

garethmb,-1.0,"Knock At The Cabin Is A Tense And Engaging Thriller
Writer/Director M. Night Shyamalan is back with his new thriller “Knock at
the Cabin” and like his earlier works; the film blends reality with
supernatural elements to put ordinary people in circumstances that are
dangerous and unnatural.
The film involves a same-sex couple named Eric (Jonathan Groff) and Andrew
(Ben Aldridge), who have taken their adopted daughter Wen (Kristen Cui),
to a secluded cabin for a relaxing vacation.

The arrival of four strangers lead by the imposing but soft-spoken Leonard
(Dave Bautista) becomes dangerous when Leonard informs them that the world
is about to end and only by choosing to sacrifice one of them can the
Apocalypse be diverted.

Leonard explains that the four had the same vision of the end of the world
and that they were drawn to save it by taking such drastic actions. They
inform their captives that they will not harm them but they will not be
allowed to leave as they must make the choice and failure to do so will
doom everyone and force the three of them to exist as the sole-survivors
of the aftermath.

Convinced that the intruders are insane; Eric and Andrew refuse the offer
and watch as one of the four captives sacrifices themselves which is soon
followed by news on the television of a massive earthquakes which resulted
in tsunamis.

Convinced it is a ruse or simply timed events to the days news; the
captives again refuse a request only to see another sacrifice followed by
more news of devastation happening around the world.

What follows is a tight thriller as Eric and Andrew learn more about their
captives and the changing world situation which forces them to confront a
world gone mad.

The film is good at setting a tone and maintaining a mild tension
throughout as the audience is left to wonder how real what is being
presented by Leonard and his associates are. I liked the fact that the
movie did not try to wrap things up nice and tidy and left the audiences
with some questions about the events as well as what would happen in the
aftermath.

Bautista gives an career-best performance and shows that his is capable of
doing more than the action-comedy genre which he has been playing to date
and I hope he continues to seek roles such as this.

While the film may not reach the levels of some of his earlier classics,
Shyamalan has crafted an entertaining film that keeps you guessing.

However once Leonard is joined by his three other companions his insistence and subsequent forceful entry to the cabin makes his character seem far more sinister. 

Denial and paranoia set the tone as the four invading characters disclose their backgrounds and cult like vision that has set them on a mission to save the World from the Apocalypse. During back and forth conversations and threat of death, love and compassion strongly prevails even after some graphic killing. When faced with the reality of the home invaders reasoning for their actions, Eric and Andrew’s rising panic with each separate revelation fuels suffocating tension that continues to grow until the final moments. With very clever use of the four headless horsemen of the Apocalypse, and the persuasive nature of Leonard, eventually Eric and Andrew believe what they are being told.

Throughout “Knock at the Cabin” M. Night Shyamalan’s direction keeps the audience constantly questioning. Are the events unfolding on screen actually real or just cult like paranoia twisting events to suit their agenda. With excellent performances and great use of lighting and cinematography to convey fear and rising tension, “Knock at the Cabin” is an engaging end of the World thriller.",2023-02-09T08:40:39.871Z,631842,4 stars,0.5375022888183594
CinemaSerf,6.0,"""Wen"" (Kristen Cui) is out collecting grasshoppers when she encounters the statuesque and friendly ""Leonard"" (Dave Bautista). When his three friends turn up though, she gets spooked and runs to her remote cabin home where her dads ""Eric"" (Jonathan Groff) and ""Andrew"" (Ben Aldridge) are chilling on the veranda. She is worried, and soon they are locked in with four seemingly hostile folks outside demanding entry. The doors and windows are no match for their rather medieval weapons and soon the boys are tied to their chairs fearing the worst in homophobic behaviour. Thing is, the four appear to mean them no harm - well, not directly anyway. ""Leonard"", in a calm and measured manner, now regales them with a tale foretelling an apocalyptic end for mankind unless this small family make a very, very, tough decision in the next twenty four hours. Should they not, then we soon discover that things will not go well for them, but do not go at all well for their four ""persuaders"" either. Bautista is quite good here, as is Aldridge and for a while the plot is actually quite intriguing. The ultimate catch-22 with a question posed to rational people - who love each other - that would test any of us. Sadly, though, M Night Shyamalan can't keep the intrigue sustained and it rather runs out of steam from the middle onwards. Groff doesn't really show up and neither, for that matter, does Rupert Grint. I also felt that young Cui takes a little too much screen time and grates after a while. It's the shortest of short stories, and might have worked better had it just been the hour with a tighter narrative and less meandering. Still - it does ask a question that I'm not sure I could answer either in their position - and I did quite enjoy watching it.",2023-02-10T12:46:58.211Z,631842,3 stars,0.5404582023620605
Chris Sawin,5.0,"The tender, sympathetic, and desperate performances are what make _Knock at the Cabin_ worthwhile. The psychological and horror aspects of the film are timid at best with the true identities of Leonard and his associates being obvious, gruesome elements that you never see, and an apocalypse that is a lackluster disaster overall.

It’s not that _Knock at the Cabin_ is entirely bad, it’s that it seems to actively know it could be more creative, thrilling, and shocking and yet purposely chooses to bury its head in the sand and let mediocrity have its remorselessly bland way with it.

Nathan,7.0,"Knock at the Cabin is an interesting premise that has a lot going for it in terms of atmosphere and mystique but fails to land a satisfactory ending.

I was pleasantly surprised with the story structure. The movie wastes no time throwing the audience into the conflict within the opening frames of the film. This allowed for an increased focus on the main story while maintaining a decent pace. The first act of the film is great, as the audience is new to the story and the mystery is still fresh. But slowly, the plot starts to repeat the same beats resulting in a less engaging second act. As the film draws to its conclusion it’s ending is incredibly predictable which slightly worked for me but may be divisive to a general audience. I did enjoy the small flashbacks of the couple's life. It added much needed context without taking too much time away from the main story arch.

The acting in the film is overall good, but there are some major characters that stand out from the rest of the cast. Dave Bautista was excellent, he had a very serious, menacing presence, but had a kind and gentle nature to him that begged the audience to trust him. This was by far one of his more complex roles in his career and I think he did a great job. Abby Quinn had probably my favorite performance of the film. Her dramatic scenes were mesmerizing and really drew me in. She had such subtle facial gestures that expressed a deep sense of fear and sadness with eyes that could tell a story by themselves. It was superb. Jonathan Groff was good, although he really seems to be playing a similar style of character to all of his previous roles. I was excited to see Rupert Grint, but we do not really get to see enough of him as he is only in the film's first act and when he is present barely talks.

Cinematography was great. There were some really interesting camera angles and shots that were classic from Shyamalan. I thought he did a really good job of portraying the brutality of what was occurring without actually showing it. Having it pan away from the action or it being just out frame gave the audience what they needed to know without directly seeing it. It slightly added to the suspense of it all. Although, as a true horror fan, I would have loved to see some gore! There are some very corny sequences with terrible CGI that took me out of this movie. But with a budget of only $20m, I am not sure what more I could have asked for.

Overall, there is a lot to like about Knock at the Cabin, but it is missing multiple key elements that hold it back from being a Shyamalan instant classic. Despite that, I think it was an enjoyable watch that I recommend you check out in theaters.

Nathan,8.0,"Infinity Pool is a horny, horrifying look at ego and self-indulgence based on self-doubt and failure. The film follows novelist James Foster (Alexander Skarsgard) as he is mesmerized by Gabi (Mia Goth) resulting in a stained week of violence and debauchery. 

The plot is a story of two halves, the first being incredibly strong as the audience is learning the mystery behind the experiments, guests and their past. Viewers can resonate a ton with Foster's wife as she is constantly neglected and misused by her husband. That is ever apparent in the shot selection as she is constantly out of frame or unfocused. This part really worked for me, but as the story progressed the scope grew too large for its own good. The ending becomes unfocused, resulting in aspects that do not make sense or are incredibly unbelievable in the world that the film has set up.

The film has fantastic cinematography though, filled with interesting visuals that create for a very unique and chaotic viewing experience. Every shot is calculated and filmed in an interesting way that creates suspense and uncomfortable feelings.

The performances are superb, Mia Goth has found her niche in the ""elevated"" horror genre becoming a modern-day scream queen. Although, after X, Pearl, and now Infinity Pool, I would like to see her do some more diverse work, but she has nailed this type of character. Alexander Skarsgard is also great with some emotionally engrossing scenes mixed with cold, emotionless scenes that create an interesting dichotomy for the characters headspace.

Although the film slightly stumbles towards the end and might have a bit of a bloated run time, there is still a ton to enjoy with a creative story, mind bending cinematography, and powerhouse performances.

Chris Sawin,8.0,"_Infinity Pool_ is an eccentric sci-fi horror filled with disturbing sex, crazy amounts of ultra-violence, and a sequence where Mia Goth breastfeeds Alexander Skarsgard. It’s super weird and obviously a different type of film that won’t appeal to the typical mainstream blockbuster crowd.

The film takes an interesting detour into what defines gluttony and to what extremes humans will undergo in order to feel hungry again when their stomachs are already bloated from overeating.

A trip outside their compound together ends in a rather drunken tragedy and to the most peculiar of government-backed solutions to a problem that could well have seen the ritual slaughter of ""James"". That's quite intriguing, but the rest of this recycles that theory as an increasingly debauched and unentertaining series of scenarios are played out in front of us, presumably in order to illustrate a range of human frailties and issues with confidence and self-belief. There is one rather amusing scene with Goth on the bonnet of her car towards the end, but the remainder of this is just a rather messy, drug infused, meander of a story that left me wondering why it went on for almost two hours. At times the writing is quite smart, but all too infrequently to sustain this thinnest of stories and by midway through I could honestly say that I couldn't have cared less about any of them - even if Skarsgård does have a nice ass. I suspect you will either love or hate this, there were people at the screening who laughed, others who left - I was probably more on the side of the latter.

CinemaSerf,5.0,"Now don't judge. You mustn't judge. If you do this will come across as the most atrocious piece of cinema since ""Mesa of Lost Women"" (1953). ""Christopher Robin"" (Nikolai Leon) is taking his fiancee back to the wood in which he played with ""Pooh"", ""Piglet"", ""Eyeore"" etc. as a child. What he doesn't appreciate, though, is that in the intervening years things got tough for his erstwhile friends. They couldn't fend for themselves, and were reduced to cannibalism to survive.... Aside from altering the balance of their tiny mids, this also instilled in ""Pooh"" and ""Piglet"" a grim and determined need for vengeance. What now ensues is hilarious. What ever budget there was must have been spent on gin for the cast: the costumes and lighting are pretty dreadful and the script - well that is almost as bad as the acting. Leon is quite easy on the eye, but the sight of him being whipped to within an inch of his life with the tail of ""Eyeore"" by a large man in an ill-fitting yellow bear suit whose mouth was oozing honey like a drooling bairn just has to be seen. Cinema can be too earnest and worthy at times, and I think this is the perfect recalibration for that - it is certainly neither, nor is it a film you will ever (want to) remember after you've seen it. Still, the cinema was packed and there was laughter a-plenty throughout the eighty minutes or so this risible drivel lasted. It could easily be a school project - nothing here is of an higher standard, and it did make me squirm at times as the 1970s ""Doctor Who"" special effects department came back to life - but I didn't hate it.",2023-03-25T10:20:29.086Z,980078,2 stars,0.5061653852462769

tmdb51616167,1.0,"#WinnieThePoohBloodAndHoney #MovieReview 🍯🐻🔪

""Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey"" is a horror twist on the beloved Winnie the Pooh characters, offering a dark and unsettling take on the classic story. While I'll do my best to avoid spoilers, expressing my thoughts on this film is challenging given the unsettling content it presents.

From the start, the movie sets a grim tone with the disturbing portrayal of Eeyore as a man-eating creature, a jarring departure from the familiar and endearing characters we know. The film takes the characters to grotesque and repulsive extremes, leaving viewers feeling conflicted and saddened by the drastic changes.

As the storyline unfolds, the revelation of Piglet and Pooh as serial killers adds an uncomfortable layer to the narrative. The transformation of beloved characters into evil personas, including Rabbit, Owl, and Gopher, leaves the audience bewildered and unsettled.

Unfortunately, the storyline falls short, and the acting fails to elevate the film. Watching this on Peacock proved to be a disappointing experience, with missed opportunities to explore a more nuanced approach to the characters. The decision to depict the characters as realistic yet unsettling figures in a bizarre fantasy world adds to the confusion and detracts from the overall viewing experience.

In conclusion, ""Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey"" misses the mark with its dark and misguided interpretation of the beloved characters. It struggles to find its footing, leaving viewers perplexed and uncomfortable with the drastic departure from the heartwarming tales of the Hundred Acre Wood. 🍯🐻🔪",2024-09-02T19:43:18.612Z,980078,2 stars,0.48806822299957275
Wuchak,6.0,"**_When Winnie-the-Pooh goes bad_**

After being traumatized by a stalker, a young woman gets away from it all with several friends at a vacation home in 100 Acre Wood, England. Unfortunately, a certain famous pooh bear has gone feral, along with his piglet friend.

“Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey” (2023) is a competently-made English slasher despite only costing $100,000 (I would’ve thought it cost 5-10 times that amount). The first Winnie-the-Pooh book went into the public domain in the USA at the outset of 2022 and so this indie started filming several months later in April. Disney only retains exclusive rights to the depictions of these characters from their own franchise, although they apparently own the copyrights to Tigger, who was originally slated to be in the film.  

One of the highlights is the cast of females, highlighted by Natasha Tosini (Lara), Amber Doig-Thorne (Alice), Danielle Ronald (Zoe), May Kelly (Tina) and Maria Taylor (Maria). The director needs to learn better how to shoot women (no pun intended), but I suppose he does serviceable enough.

Despite being proficiently made, there are some boring or overlong scenes, like the intro involving Christopher Robin. The emptiness of the proceedings can be traced to none of the protagonists being fleshed-out as characters, except Maria, and even she’s not very interesting. So the viewer doesn’t care about them when they start running around screaming. On top of this, peripheral characters are thrown-in out of nowhere, like the redneck guys in the last act (which I didn’t have an issue with, but others did).

It's cabin-in-the-woods horror that could be described as “Wrong Turn” set in England, just replacing the mutated hillbillies with the animal characters from Milne’s books. As far as I’m concerned, this is superior to the original 2003 “Wrong Turn” (I’ve only seen one other of those flicks).

Because it cost so little to make, it made millions at the box office, which led to a sequel the next year (that’s superior because the writer/director had ten times as much money to work with), as well as a “Piglet” movie in 2025. There’s another “Winnie” sequel in the works. 

It runs 1 hour, 24 minutes, and was shot in Ashdown Forest, which is 50 miles south of London in the north section of East Sussex.

I am all for telling these types of stories about race and sexuality, but the message is so blatant that it takes precedent over the plot. It results in a very manufactured experience. Despite my issues with the story, the movie was just not that funny. There were times I did laugh, I can admit, but that will happen with the amount of jokes they were spitting out.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Storm Reid (""June"") wakes up a bit the worst for wear one morning only to find she is meant to be at the airport picking up her mother and her boyfriend who are returning to the United Sates after a trip to Colombia. Oddly, the pair are no-shows and soon she is caught in a mystery that could involve kidnapping and the FBI as the young woman tries to find out just where ""Grace"" and ""Kevin"" have gone! What now ensues is actually quite a scarily effective treatise on just how easy it is for an internet-savvy teenager to use some fairly basic navigational skills and a fair degree of common sense too use the web to acquire a comprehensive knowledge of the missing couple. For me, too much of this happens on hard to follow busy laptop or phone screens, and the story itself has one or two pretty substantial holes - those becoming annoyingly evident and implausible as the plot develops. Still, it's a decent effort from Reid and is an effectively paced drama that just about keeps the interest for the almost two hours it takes us to reach the really rather convoluted and far-fetched resolution.",2023-05-08T11:33:34.028Z,768362,3 stars,0.6626378893852234
Silverstein,8.0,"Aneesh Chaganty made an immediate impact with his 2018 feature debut Searching. While the Google alumnus was not the first to use the screen life format (that is, telling a story only through what we can see on computer screens and digital devices), Chaganty certainly popularized it with a compelling story of a father looking for his missing daughter.

In 2023’s Missing, Chaganty produces and gets a ‘story by’ credit but hands the screenwriting and directing to Will Merrick and Nick Johnson. This spiritual follow-up to Searching again revolves around someone who vanishes. The roles get reversed in Missing, replacing a parent who has to fumble his way around social media as the primary searcher with the very tech-savvy June Allen (Storm Reid), a teen who is looking for her missing mother, Grace (Nia Long).

While Aneesh Chaganty isn’t at the helm this time around, his influence is still very apparent in Missing. We don’t see June all that often, but as in Searching, we get a sense of what the character is feeling when we watch her type a message in a chat box but doesn’t send it, letting the cursor blink for a few moments before erasing the text and typing a revised message that’s more thoughtful. Anyone who has used computers would be able to relate to moments like these where we write off the top of our heads, sometimes in a very emotional state, only to catch ourselves and think better of what we’ve said. In lieu of seeing facial expressions or hearing line readings, this approach to conveying emotion and giving insight into a character’s thoughts is one of the keys to a screen life narrative, giving the story a beating heart when it could easily lean too much into the technical side and become cold and soulless.

Another wrinkle that Merrick and Johnson’s film introduces is the lack of money for the protagonist. Being a high schooler, June doesn’t have much in the way of financial resources and is entirely dependent on the money her mother left prior to going down to Colombia on vacation. This presents a challenge when the FBI’s investigation into Grace’s disappearance doesn’t make enough headway for June, forcing her to hire someone down in Colombia to help find clues.

With June’s limited funds, she isn’t able to hire a private investigator and is only able to afford the services of Javier (Joaquim de Almeida), an online platform worker. The inclusion of this character grounds the story as Javier is the type of ordinary person one would expect to come across in today’s gig economy. Being a father himself, Javier connects with June, understanding her desperation to locate her missing mother. The burgeoning relationship between Javier and June is one of the highlights of this film, helping to build the emotional resonance that the story needs to keep viewers engaged.

With the twists in the narrative and rock-solid performances from Reid and de Almeida, Missing is one of the rare films that manages to equal the trailblazer that came before.

Manuel São Bento,8.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/missing-mini-review

""Missing may not surpass the original, but it stands as a compelling standalone sequel. The screenlife storytelling technique remains fascinating, as debutants Will Merrick and Nick Johnson bring an insane level of mind-blowing detail to every single digital frame.

The tense, twisty narrative holds a generic yet efficiently developed mother-daughter emotional core. accompanied by a wonderful score, smooth pacing, excellent performances, and high entertainment value. Believability is stretched a tad too much in a crazier screenplay, and the screenlife format poses a challenge in conveying the more dramatic moments.

Minor issues that won't change an inevitably fantastic reception from a broad audience.""

This film feels like its trying to emulate 80's style horror flicks but it doesn't understand the basic mechanics, that made those classic films work. In short order, rounded characters, charm and chemistry, not to mention adhering to a simple, tried and true, horror formula. 

Story wise, Teen wolf hops around like a barefoot beach goer on hot sand. Its all over the place. Its not helped either by cardboard cut out characters, with little to no presence or mutual chemistry.

garethmb,-1.0,"Brodie Torrance (Gerard Butler), is a recently widowed dad who looks
forward to completing his nearly empty run from Singapore to Tokyo so he
can take advantage of the time difference and meet up with his daughter in
Hawaii in time to celebrate the new year.

In the new film “Plane” things do not go as planned as the nearly empty
the flight also hosts a prisoner transfer as a dangerous fugitive named Louis
(Mike Colter), is brought onto the flight late.

Forced by a corporate officer to fly through a storm they were told would
be clear by the time they reached it to save time and fuel, the flight
encounters severe issues and soon find themselves without avionics and
forced to make an emergency landing on an island.

Unable to send for help and unsure of their exact location, Brodie learns
that they are on an outer island of the Philippines and that there is only
insurrectionists and militia on the island and that the military or police
are not options.

While attempting to find a way to contact help, Brodie enlists Louis to
help and soon finds that the passengers and crew have been taking hostage
by a brutal local militia.  Forced to improvise rescue and wait for
help, the tense and violent situation quickly becomes a living nightmare
as they fight to survive.

The tension level of the film is great as the early segments in the plane
did a great job of showing the routine of a pilot and also ramped up the
tension. I can be a nervous passenger when a plane gets into bad weather
and I found my palms getting sweaty and anxiety creeping in during the
detailed sequences of the flight in peril.

The action of the film was engaging as were the characters as they were
easy to pull for despite not having much in the way of backstory or
character development.  The film has plenty of action as was engaging from
start to finish which makes “Plane” a pleasant diversion and one fan of
Butler will not want to miss.

Nathan,6.0,"I was pleasantly surprised by Plane. Going into it, I had pretty low expectations as it seemed to be a cheap, action flick that was built for the dad's in our life. But there were some pretty good performances, set pieces, and brutal action that raised this movie from mediocrity.

The plot is incredibly bare bones: a plane gets damaged in a storm and crash lands on a desolate island. We've seen this used in countless films and TV shows throughout the years but, the way this is handled is pretty incredible. We see it from the pilots perspective as he and the stewards are trying to navigate the situation to create the best course of action to survive. It was done in a very believable way, giving us a glimpse at crash landing procedure and how truly indestructible planes are. The entire 30-minutes sequence had me on the edge of my seat even though I knew it was coming from a mile away. The CGI in this section was quite rough though as the plane looked like something rendered in an Xbox 360 game.

The movie does fall into some pretty classic tropes in movies like this. One being that almost all the ""good"" people are the classic white American men and woman, but the ""bad"" people (the island combatants and our main prisoner hero) are individuals of color. It is subtle, but something I noticed that slightly rubbed me the wrong way. Also the depiction of how the Philippines refused to assist in their own territory was laughable. But it opened the way for the good men of the American military were there to save the day and kill some island terrorists. It has some minor military propaganda that didn't totally take away from my experience, but worth a mention. 

The performances were all pretty good. Gerard Butler played his usual role, I enjoyed his charisma as a pilot but also the gruff and militaristic persona he pulled out from his previous service. Mike Colter was great as the ultimate badass of the movie, killing terrorists with whatever he could get his hands on. This was nothing against his performance, but I hated how they wrote his characters ending in the film. It did not do his character arch any justice and felt out of place. The rest of the cast was decent.

Overall, this movie delivers exactly what it promised in a short concise runtime and I cannot ask any more than that.

tensharpe,6.0,"May contain an odd spoiler 

“Plane” has a Scottish Pilot, Brodie Torrance ( Gerard Butler ) intent on getting his passengers to their destination in time to meet up with his daughter during the New Year festivities. However all does not go to plan when bad weather puts paid to any such activities and prematurely forces Brodie to make an emergency landing. During the attempt to land an FBI agent escorting a dangerous criminal, Louis Gaspare ( Mike Colter ), drops his mobile phone. Rather than leave it during a dangerous decent he tries to retrieve it only to loose both his life and that of a stewardess trying to help him. 

Surviving this landing on a remote island was not easy but the skills of Brodie saves the remaining passengers and crew. However far from praised for his actions the passengers decide it’s rather an inconvenience and complain constantly as the crew try to repair the communications. Unfortunately there is much more for the passengers to complain about once they are taken hostage by rebel forces who control the Island. More deaths ensue, however Brodie and his new friend, Louis are the only two to avoid capture after killing a few rebels along the way. Brodie and Louis work together to dispatch more rebels in an attempt to rescue the hostages.

What ensues is a Die Hard style action thriller but based at New Year rather than Christmas. “Plane” does have some tense moments but very much ticks every Die Hard trope box it can. What is extremely notable, much like Die Hard, a rather large number of rebels are killed compared to hostages. In hindsight, as requested by Brodie, if I was Hans Gruber , sorry the rebel leader, I’d have let all the hostages go. I did enjoy this movie but for what it is, an action packed, nothing new , 1 hour 47 mins.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"OK, where is Jason Statham? He does these things so much better! Maybe he was off having an haircut so they decided to cast a distinctly wooden Gerard Butler as airline captain ""Torrance"" who is charged with flying his plane from Singapore to Tokyo before he heads on to his daughter's wedding in the USA. There aren't many passengers on his airliner, so to save cash and fuel he is directed to fly very near a violent storm that - well, next thing he has managed to land his sizeable aeroplane on a remote and lawless Filipino island (that luckily is replete with a dirt-track ""mining"" road that would not look out of place encircling Los Angeles). Now we happen to know that one of his few charges was also under the charge of the police, and now ""Brodie"" and the erstwhile captive - and useful - ""Gaspare"" (Mike Colter) must unite to fend off the venal bandits lead by their chief ""Junmar"" (Evan Dane Taylor) whilst getting a message to the rescue parties that can hopefully come and save their bacon. This film is so far-fetched that you might as well leave any need for reality at the door as you go in. The dialogue is pedestrian and the plot lurches from one implausibly half-baked scenario to another with consummate ease. That said, it hots up nicely for the last twenty minutes of gunfighting and that does rescue it a little from the mediocrity it probably deserves.

Plane is a low-budget action/survival movie that checks all the boxes and provides plenty of gritty Gun fights and brutal melee combat along the way. The film that didn’t spend much time picking a clever name also didn’t waste much time on character development. Instead, the plot is centered on Gerard Butler as he works to secure the safety and survival of a small group of passengers. Unfortunately, the island they crash-landed on is full of a bunch of pirate/terrorist types, so Butler does some shooting and punching, and choking to save the day. Plane won’t win any awards, but it is a solid action movie that I would watch again and recommend renting (probably not a whole $20 purchase to own, though) to any action fan. I’m glad it got a theatrical release so people can trust that it’s a little bigger budget and higher quality than most straight-to-stream action films.",2023-02-11T03:28:59.326Z,646389,4 stars,0.5512738823890686

""Plane exceeds low personal expectations. Originality, creativity, and deep exploration of themes or character arcs aren’t exactly part of the screenplay, but Jean-François Richet executes all his ideas in such an efficient manner that it fully justifies releasing in theaters instead of going straight to VOD.

Ahmetaslan27,6.0,"**This movie is for entertainment purpose**

Although the scenario is expected and there is nothing new in it, I enjoyed watching the movie, this type of movie that I can call popcorn movies that you see in the cinema or at home, and this type is fun doesn't require the viewer to think a lot during the show.

Gerard Butler was distinguished. sometimes i forget that he is an actor of action movies and he has similar movies. When you watch the movie, you feel that it is a film in the early 2000s, and this makes you feel that you need to watch this type of movies from time to time. The movie managed to grab my attention because there is a factor of isolation. Isolation in the air while boarding the plane and the problems that occurred during take-off and after landing on the ground, which is the isolation of staying on the island.

Imagine you land the plane in an area controlled by separatists and the killers are people who don't follow the law. This movie has become a kind of survival, which is the struggle for survival, and these movies have a large type of viewers, regardless of the usual plot and the familiar and expected ending.

If i am from the kind of audience whose movies only depend on the plot, I will criticize the movie from beginning to end, but there are sometimes movies that you should watch for fun, like Plane 2023. Cinema is the art of conversation, but it is also an enjoyable experience. Each movie has a specific goal for viewers.

garethmb,-1.0,"International intrigue is the name of the game in the latest Action-Caper
film from Guy Ritchie and he has delivered a winning mix of action and
comedy with” Operation Fortune: Ruse de guerre”.

When a secret device known as “The Handle” is taken from a lab by a
precision combat team, the U.K. government calls in Nathan (Cary Elwes),
to gather a team and retrieve the item even though there is little known
about what it is and what it can do. The simple fact that it was taken by
force and is supposedly on the market for Ten Billion dollars makes this
an item of high value.

Nathan quickly recruits Orson (Jason Statham), away from his vacation and
despite his quirks and laundry list of items required for his
participation due to said quirks; he is soon brought into the group.

The team is rounded out by young agent JJ (Bugzy Malone), and American
computer expert Sarah (Aubrey Plaza), which irritates Orson to no end as
he liked the tech he had become used to working with and the fact that
they were hired away by a rival firm and Sarah’s give as good as she takes
attitude causes him stress.

It is learned that noted arms dealer Greg (Hugh Grant), appears to be
brokering the deal and the crew travels from one part of the world to
another with a rival team and all manner of dangers around them.

In a race against time, the team brings actor Danny Francesco (Josh
Hartnett), into the mix as he is a favorite of Greg’s and the hope is that
this will provide the team an introduction and access by having Sarah pose
as Danny’s new lady.

What follows is a madcap and comedic adventure with loads of enjoyable
characters and situations and enough action to keep things moving and
enough laughs to keep audiences smiling.

The cast is great and works very well with one another and it would be
great to see them do further adventures with one another as their shared
dysfunctions, attitudes, and quirks make them realistic and engaging and
a nice change from the indestructible Teflon agents we are so used to
seeing in films of this type.

Nathan,3.0,"**_Operation Fortune's_ convoluted plot and terrible pacing result in a viewing experience that leaves a lot to be desired.**

Operation Fortune was a terrible movie from start to finish. The plot was incredibly generic, filled with a bunch of cool spy jargon that made the agents sound really cool. The pace is way too fast, with jump cuts from scene to scene that attempt to be quick and seamless but just left me lost. I spent more time trying to figure out what was going on, where we were, and why we were here than I did enjoying the actual movie. The action was average at best, filled with cuts that tried to mask the poor choreography. When we were not spending time on lackluster action set pieces, it was used to deliver exposition dumps to help the audience attempt to understand what was going on. I have a hard time coming up with anything positive about my experience with the film.

The performances left a lot to be desired. I think Jason Statham and Josh Hartnett did a decent job, but they did not blow me away. None of the main cast had any amount of chemistry, particularly Statham and Plaza. The latter quite disappointed me in this film. None of her comedic timing worked, and I found her performance to be rather flat. With how stacked the cast was, I am leaning toward believing that the script was so horrid that it was limiting the actors abilities to put on a good performance.

Overall, I had a pretty terrible time watching this in theaters. I kept checking the time, waiting for the credits to finally roll. If you like Guy Ritchie, check this film out; otherwise, skip it because you will avoid wasting two hours of your life.

Acting is generally reasonable. Hugh Grant does a great Michael Caine(??) impression.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"I was quite disappointed that despite months of cinema trailers, this went straight to the television. Why? Well I reckon that's because if I had seen it on a big screen I would have struggled my way through it in one go. As it is, I've taken about three days to get to the end of this stylish looking but really insubstantial crime caper. The story centres around the dodgy antics of ""Greg"" (Hugh Grant) who is looking to facilitate a $10 billion arms deal that just about nobody wants to happen. It falls to ""Orson"" (Jason Statham) and his team of crack operatives to come up with a plan to thwart the deal and apprehend the bidders! The only chink in the armour of our ""Greg"" is his idolisation of the American film star ""Danny"" (Josh Hartnett) and so they recruit him to come and partake in a bit of real life fan-doration (obviously without explaining just quite what is going on, or how perilous it might be) and off they travel to beautiful Antalya in Turkey where they must use all their guile, wit and technical savvy - largely down to ""Sarah"" (Aubrey Plaza) - before someone smells a rat. The problem here is that the story is just all too old hat. We've seen it all once too often and so when we have to rely on the characterisations to enliven the thing we are presented with an overly hammy Grant; a Statham who really is reusing an old - and well wrinkly - skin and Plaza who is really rather a lacklustre personality on screen. The jokes are all a bit predictable, as are the 007-light action scenes, car chases and - indeed - the whole thing just lacks for any sense of originality. It's not the worst film I've seen lately, but I wonder if maybe Guy Ritchie is just spent now? Perhaps it is time for him to take a few years off and try to work on something that can capitalise on his undoubtedly creative quirkiness without offering the same old sandwich just on a different shiny plate.",2023-04-14T13:29:19.314Z,739405,2 stars,0.5204557776451111
CinemaSerf,7.0,"Fans of the BBC sitcom ""One Foot in the Grave"" might recognise something of the ""Victor Meldrew"" in Tom Hanks' portrayal of the eponymous curmudgeon. Formerly head of the community association, he takes it upon himself each morning to do his ""rounds"" - checking the gates are closed, the permits are displayed, the recycling is correct - all pretty anal, really. A combination of circumstances are about to rock his rather pedestrian world, though. He is laid off after thirty-odd years at work, a deed which renders him pretty rudderless; and he gets new neighbours - ""Marisol"" (Mariana Treviño), husband ""Tommy"" (Manuel Garcia-Ruffo) and their two daughters. Now their arrival causes him no end of irritation (and, if truth be told - for me too!). The family are pretty hapless and soon ""Otto"" finds himself helping them out and gradually, her forceful and annoying character starts to morph into something more accommodating and he begins to feel just a tad useful. Now it ought to be said that most of this story evolves against a backdrop of attempts by the older man to kill himself. There is humour to be had here, as well a rather nuanced message illustrating the effects of loneliness and a general resignation that the fruitful section of his life is finished. Gradually using ""Marisol"" and a few other neighbours as conduits, we learn of the tragedies that have led him to his current predicament, and to a position where there might just be a new light at the end of his tunnel. From a character perspective, I preferred the ""Otto"" at the start of the film. A rather bitter and amusingly sarcastic figure, but as the plot develops we lose that sharpness, the story becomes a little too cluttered and I found the initial poignancy falls away as a rather sentimental degree of melodrama edges into it all. Still, Hanks offers a strong performance and after her distinctly annoying start I found myself increasingly engaged with the whole family across the road who might just offer ""Otto"" some validation and/or salvation. It's also a remarkable understatedly inclusive film. This community has all sorts of colours, shapes and sizes - and ""Otto"" for all his faults, has no truck with discrimination. This inclusiveness is delivered to us quietly as if it is all no big deal. A more productive and subtle method than many offering the screamingly obvious box-ticking characterisations. It's essentially a remake of the more characterful ""A Man Called Ove"" (2015) - a Swedish film with the excellently cast Rolf Lassgård in the title role, but it's still well worth a watch.",2023-01-09T09:57:08.418Z,937278,4 stars,0.518523633480072
Nathan,7.0,"A Man Called Otto is heartfelt and sad story about a widowed husband trying to find his place in the world without his wife. It is incredibly touching and can resonate with any audience member no matter the age. 

Going into the film, I was expecting it to have it's sad moments but there are times where this movie gets very dark. This was a surprise and it is a major tonal shift from the rest of the film. It works really well as this tonal juxtaposition is a metaphor for how Otto is feeling on the inside versus the positivity that is given to him in his every day life.

Tom Hanks delivers a great performance here. He had great comedic timing and delivered a tremendous amount of emotion in just his subtle facial expressions. Mariana Treviño was excellent and her chemistry with Hanks is superb throughout the film. Her hard fast nature is able to drive a wedge into Otto, giving him the ability to open up for the first time and genuinely live since the passing of his wife. It worked wonderfully and was a highlight of the film. The majority of the other performances were poor... I liked the kids though.

The plot is pretty generic in terms of overall structure, I could have predicted the ending after the first ten minutes. It differentiates itself by having a very real and brutal look at the mental health of a widower. How someone's lack of direction and companionship can lead them down a dark path. It was great. This movie does try to shoe horn in some social commentary about transgender acceptance and societies selfishness with phones. I am all for giving that type of representation in film, but it was done here in a very inorganic way, making it feel not genuine.

Overall, this movie accomplished its goal and made me cry. It really affected me as both my grandmothers are widowed and it let me gain a view of what they went through in the aftermath of losing a partner.

Overall, don’t expect anything grand, but if the audience is able to turn their mind off there is plenty of fun to be had with this film.

The Movie Mob,6.0,"**Shotgun Wedding struggles to balance its goofy tone but has some funny moments.**

Shotgun Wedding used the kidnapped couple in danger and rediscovering love plot that we have seen in many other rom-coms like The Lost City but struggled with balancing the serious subject matter with its goofy moments. With all the wedding guests taken hostage, it raised the stakes a little too high and made it harder to laugh. But Jennifer Coolidge cut threw all that and delighted, entertained, and stole every scene she was in, proving her comedic chops once again. Jennifer Lopez and Josh Duhamel were fun, but the script forced a frustrated couple plot that didn’t take the time to develop. It seemed like the first 20 minutes and last hour and a half had two different couples because they became total goofballs as soon as the action started. My absolute favorite part of the movie was the final climax and big death scene. I laughed out loud and rewound it to watch it again. Shotgun Wedding is a straight-to-stream rom-com that stands above some of the other streaming rom-coms (like the Father of the Bride remake or The Valet) …but not far above.",2023-02-11T05:53:30.555Z,758009,3 stars,0.4933265745639801
r96sk,6.0,"I got what I expected from <em>'Shotgun Wedding'</em>.

It is exactly the type of film that you'd think it would be, mostly in a negative way. I like Jennifer Lopez and she's solid enough, while Jennifer Coolidge and Lenny Kravitz are the minor standouts elsewhere. The rest? I don't have any positives, I'm afraid. The plot is pointlessly overdone and overstays its welcome, as anticipated.

I, personally, wouldn't go as far to say it's a bad movie, but it most definitely fails to entertain. I do like the final scene of Kravitz's though, it's pretty cool and fairly well done. For me, overall, this is a standard 6/10 flick - the type that I won't remember by the end of the week, unfortunately.",2023-02-20T01:17:50.250Z,758009,3 stars,0.5989214777946472
Nathan,7.0,"M3GAN achieved its goal perfectly by delivering a hilarious dark comedy that was incredibly aware at how ridiculous the premise is. It had me laughing my ass off and had some pretty decent kills for a PG-13 film, although I think it could have been even better with a hard R rating.

But this film is not just a dark horror comedy, it dives deeper than its surface appeal. Deep down there is intimate social commentary on parents using technology as a crutch. Whenever M3GAN is in the room, Gemma finds it easier to neglect her niece and let's M3GAN take control of the parenting. This makes it much harder for her to get a genuine connection with her to fulfill motherly needs. I found this surprisingly compelling and really does have a genuine impact in today's society, obviously not with life size android dolls but with tablets and phones. Really enjoyed this aspect of the film.

Allison Williams delivered a pretty decent performance; it was nice to see her in another prominent horror role since Get Out. Violet McGraw once again was great as an inspiring child actress; her filmography is beginning to be stacked for her being such a young age. All other performances were quite lackluster, but that is expected in a film of this nature.

Overall, there is not really much more to say. This film is funny, weird, and wildly fun. It's never going to be a standout competitor for award season but there is something to say about the pure entertainment it was able to deliver.

""M3GAN doesn't reinvent the respective subgenre of killer robots or AI that turns against humans, but it kept me entertainingly invested throughout its entire runtime.

Akela Cooper's premise is pushed to its limits - and even beyond - being elevated by excellent performances, a clever satirical narrative, eyebrow-raising killings, and meaningful messages about parenting and technology's role in a child's upbringing. It doesn't take itself too seriously or tries to be more than what it truly is.

The Movie Mob,7.0,"**M3GAN knows what its target audience wants and delivers the exact fun horror comedy to thrill and delight.**

I was conflicted before seeing the movie. On the one hand, the trailer looked ridiculous. On the other, I knew that Blumhouse and James Wan partnered for this. After seeing the reviews, I finally accepted that I had to see this movie, and I’m glad I did. Was it ridiculous? Absolutely. M3GAN knew what it was. It knew it was cheesy but had fun with it while also cranking up the tension and suspense. So many cliche “stop standing there and do something” moments that surprisingly added to the stress and horror. I wouldn’t say the movie was ever scary, but it was an excellent thriller. It’s a fun Blumhouse film that was self-aware and goofy while creepy and tense. One of my favorite parts was the short scene with one of the worst detectives of all time that had me laughing out loud in the theater. M3GAN is not a movie for everyone, but people who like other Blumhouse films and dark comedies would find themselves at home with this movie.",2023-01-21T20:50:00.589Z,536554,4 stars,0.4475304186344147
CinemaSerf,6.0,"'Cady"" (Violet McGraw) finds herself living with her aunt ""Gemma"" (Alison Williams) after an altercation with a snow truck leaves her orphaned. They don't exactly hit it off. The older woman is a career-driven lady who works at a toy manufacturer, specialising in gadgets and gismos that use AI. Thing is, their market dominance is waning - much to the chagrin of boss ""David"" (Ronny Chiang). Competitors are catching up and the children are getting even more sophisticated/lazy/dependent! She has a plan though - with her colleagues ""Cole"" (Brian Jordan Alvarez) and ""Tess"" (Jen Van Epps), she is working on the ultimate ""companion"". A doll that pairs with it's owner and becomes almost sibling-like. Snag with this film is that the plot is really all rather predictable, the acting isn't up to much and I didn't find the eponymous - hideously over-dressed - creation remotely menacing. Indeed, actually, at times I found it particularly useful (the neighbour's wayward dog, for example). It's a competently strung together drama, but it's all just a little too sterile and by-the-numbers for me. It does fire a warning shot to parents who could become over-reliant on their children's own reliance on surrogate friendships and dependencies, but once that point is made - and reiterated - the rest of this is, frankly, all rather unremarkable.",2023-01-23T14:07:32.324Z,536554,3 stars,0.6691286563873291
Filipe Manuel Neto,7.0,"**It's an enjoyable film, it carries a pertinent anti-tech message, but it's not even close to being a horror film.**

First, let me make one thing clear: horror movies have an imperative duty to scare and disturb us. Tension, suspense, fear and some scares are something that should not be missing. It's the essence of horror cinema, right? So, can someone explain to me where came from the bad idea of making horror movies for teenagers who aren't old enough to ride a motorcycle? Don't get me wrong… the movie is good, and I liked it, but I can't consider it a horror movie. It is not able to frighten anyone! It has no scares (we are able to predict them from a mile!), it has no tension or suspense. As a horror movie, forget it. As the people say, it rains, but it doesn't get us wet, do you understand?

The script begins with a young girl who loses her parents in a tragic accident and goes to live with an aunt who works in a large corporation of highly technological toys. Things aren't easy and neither of them is prepared for the situation. It is in this context that we met M3GAN, a prototype of a toy that is, basically, an android child that is capable of learning, improving itself, teaching and, basically, replacing parents in the tiring task of… being parents. The problem is that, being a machine, it has no notion of good or bad, right or wrong, and that seems to have been a secondary detail in its programming. So it's no surprise that she quickly turns into a sly, cynical creature who kills without any remorse.

The film was directed by Gerard Johnstone, an illustrious unknown. Who is behind the project is the producer and screenwriter James Wan, who we know from “Saw” and “Conjuring 2”. Wan's brand is everywhere. It would have been better if he had directed it and the project had evolved into a somber film, a true horror piece. Allison Williams does the main character well, giving us yet another excellent job. The actress is living a happy moment in her professional life after having shone in “Get Out” and seems to be managing to take advantage of the opportunities. Amie Donald and Jenna Davis, in turn, give body and voice (respectively) to M3GAN, complementing the work with an animatronic doll created for this purpose.

The animatronic doll is nothing new. Cinema has used this technology for decades, and Spielberg's shark – one of the first and most infamous examples – is proof of that. However, the special effects and CGI are to be congratulated. The film utilizes a number of expensive visual and digital resources to excellent effect, wonderfully complementing what was done in the studio. The sound (particularly the sound effects related to the doll) also deserves praise, and the cinematography, even though it doesn't bring new or innovative features, makes the best use of it all. The film has good costumes and convincing sets, as well as a very good, modern and fun soundtrack. It's on the editing table that things go wrong: either because of the excessive length, or because it wants to target young age groups, the film was badly edited, and the cuts are rough. There are even scenes from the trailer that, because they are not in the final cut, make it difficult to understand the story: for example, the scene where Gemma orders M3EGAN to protect Cady, which appears in the trailer and was cut from the film, but which would help to understand why the doll starts to behave that way to protect its young owner.

The only real fear that this film conveys is the credible possibility that, in the medium term, there will be some toy similar to M3GAN. Advances in AI, computing, robot creation and design, or other technologies make it plausible. Will it be that one day we will have robots and androids that, due to their characteristics, will be considered alive and, as such, immortal and, therefore, superior to the humans who created them? I don't think anyone wants to see that. Therefore, the film carries with it a message of distrust in technology, visible not only in M3GAN, but also in Cady's technological dependence. I can do nothing but applaud: the generations born after the year 2000 saw their childhood dominated by cell phones, iPads or computers, to the point of despising conventional games and toys and alienating themselves from living together, normal and healthy, with other children. I'm not making it up, this is a fact that we can all see in a short trip to any school. And if there are parents who appreciate the creation of devices that keep their children busy, I am in the group of parents who see technology as something that should be dosed in a more measured way, allowing children a normal childhood before introducing them to the digital and tech world. I think there is a time for everything in life, and childhood shouldn't be spent looking at screens and LCDs.",2023-05-27T08:22:30.863Z,536554,3 stars,0.4862311780452728

r96sk,9.0,"<em>'M3GAN'</em> works for one reason and one reason only: the robot. I could honestly do without the entirety of the scenes that are predominantly about the adults, but the <i>Model 3 Generative Android</i> is, surprisingly, highly entertaining to watch.

The look is good, the effects are very convincing and, unexpectedly, the dialogue really adds to the character; it is lively and amusing, which can't always be said in this genre. They could've perhaps made the robot more unsettling, though it is minorly creepy once or twice.

Allison Williams, despite my lack of overt interest in the older folk, is solid in a prominent role. She looks like Amanda Peet to me in this, I even had to check it wasn't Peet; even though I knew the years/ages totally didn't work. Violet McGraw is decent. Less said about Ronny Chieng, the better.

The only thing I knew about this before watching was the dance, which isn't featured as much as I was anticipating based on how much I saw it referenced when the film came out. On similar-ish note, I enjoyed the uses of ""Titanium"" and ""Toy Soldiers"" in this.

RalphRahal,7.0,"M3GAN is a fun mix of sci-fi, horror, and satire, playing on our growing fascination (and fear) of AI. The plot is simple but effective, following a tech-driven story that doesn’t waste much time on deep explanations. Instead, it throws us straight into the chaos of a hyper-intelligent AI doll bonding with a child in ways that quickly spiral out of control. While the movie touches on interesting themes about technology and parenting, it doesn't go too deep into the mechanics of M3GAN’s creation, which leaves some questions unanswered. That being said, it still delivers an engaging and entertaining ride.

The directing keeps things moving at a steady pace, balancing horror and humor well. The cinematography is solid, with some nice shots that make M3GAN feel eerily lifelike. The use of lighting and framing helps create an unsettling atmosphere, especially when the doll is in focus. The acting is a mixed bag, while the young girl and the actress behind M3GAN absolutely carry the film, some of the supporting performances feel flat. There are moments where certain characters feel like they’re reading off a script rather than delivering natural dialogue, which can take you out of the moment.

The script is decent, with some sharp moments of humor and tension, but it could have used a bit more depth in certain areas, especially around M3GAN’s development and motivations. The sound design and score work well in building suspense, adding to the film’s creepy but playful tone. Overall, M3GAN is a fun watch, especially if you enjoy AI-themed horror with a touch of dark humor.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"I found this to be a curiously compelling drama that takes us to a fictional town where the women meet to decide how best to combat the brutality being routinely visited upon them. They must evaluate the pros and cons of staying and forgiving, of fighting back - or of just getting out of the place. Each position has some merit, and there is no clear cut solution as they convene in an hayloft and, with the help of their unassuming school teacher ""August"" (Ben Whishaw), come to this most difficult of decisions. Now I will admit to being somewhat confused as to exactly whom they were in fear of, and of just how they found themselves entirely alone whilst their husbands were all off in town trying to raise the ransom for those who inflicted the violence in the first place (though clearly not for the first time) and had somehow been apprehended and detained by the authorities. Frances McDormand's ""Scarface"" has endured this suffering for a long time, as has Judith Ivey's ""Agata"" but they take differing stances, leaving the younger women led by the fractious ""Mariche"" (Jessie Buckley), ""Ona"" (Rooney Mara) and a slightly underwhelming Claire Foy (""Salome"") to make a choice that will apply to all the villagers - women and their children. Can they conclude their deliberations before their men folk return? On the face of to, their deliberations ought to have been fairly straightforward, but Sarah Polley introduces a layered approach to their conundrum. There is faith; there is fear - of the known and the unknown; there is also a degree of reluctance amongst the women to have an open and frank conversation and this frequently leads to a sharp and tetchy conversation that successfully heightens the drama and gradually develops some of the characters. It has an observational nature to it that I found quite enthralling - and despite not having enough context to quite appreciate the entire scenario, I did find this interesting to watch.",2023-02-25T16:54:21.975Z,777245,4 stars,0.5971080660820007

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,8.0,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

Writer / director Sarah Polley brings novelist Miriam Toews‘ acclaimed novel to the screen in “Women Talking,” a story that, despite its secluded religious colony setting, has themes that ring true throughout America’s history of antiquated patriarchal systems. It’s a film about the strength of women and their ability to work together despite differing perspectives, opinions, and ideas about faith and life. This is a talky film with difficult subject matter, dialogue, and situations (it’s important to note that while the descriptions are vivid, no scenes of abuse are depicted onscreen), but it’s also a story that is hopeful and empowering.

The film takes place in a Mennonite colony where, after learning that they have been repeatedly drugged with cow anesthetic and raped while unconscious by the men in their colony, a group of women meet in a hayloft to discuss their options. They’ve settled on three: stay and fight, flee, or do nothing. None of the choices are easy, and no one can agree on the right answer to this unrelenting, endless cycle of sexual, physical and emotional abuse.

The film is one long conversation about what the women will choose to do as a collective response to the violence they have endured. Some are afraid to leave behind their sons and husbands. Others worry that any act of defiance will prevent them from entering heaven when they die. Their religious leaders have instructed them that if the men ask for forgiveness, it must be given. It’s heartbreaking to watch as many of these mothers, daughters, grandmothers, wives, and sisters debate the difficult and limited options available to them, with their faith playing such a strong role in their decisions.

I loved the film’s dark, vintage look and feel, courtesy of Luc Montpellier’s cinematography. His photography is the perfect complement to the project’s tone, with a muted palette and de-saturated colors that reflect the trauma and emotionally complex nature of the story.

The script is as complex as the performances, and the lead cast (including Rooney Mara, Claire Foy, Jessie Buckley, Judith Ivey, Ben Whishaw, August Winter, and Frances McDormand) is up to the challenge. There’s no clear standout acting-wise, as all of the cast give sophisticated turns. It’s at first confusing to keep each character and their relationships straight, especially since the film jumps right in and you have to be on your toes to keep up. Prior experience with the source material isn’t necessary, but may be helpful.

Polley’s adaptation of the novel doesn’t push boundaries as much as it could’ve, and the film is not quite as gutsy or fearless as some have claimed, but “Women Talking” is a bold statement on the subjugation of women, feminist ideals, and the way a society could be stronger if people would just come together and be willing to listen to each other.",2023-04-23T06:39:43.764Z,777245,4 stars,0.45230334997177124
Nathan,6.0,"The Pale Blue Eye had great performances, fantastic cinematography, and a decent story but fails in terms of pacing and a bloated runtime that did not feel warranted.

Christian Bale is fantastic in this role. He is incredibly intense, being able to capture the seriousness of his detective work balanced with the emotions of his unfortunate tragedies in life. A performance of this caliber is expected of Bale, but what was a surprise is the standout performance of Harry Melling. Melling was whimsical and tad odd with his portrayal of the famous Edgar Allen Poe. He legitimately stole every scene he was, including the ones with Bale.

The film was quite long and drawn out. The beginning act did fine as the audience is still learning the world and the crimes committed. But after that wears off it begins to drag going into a climatic third act. A lot of this bloat could have been cut down to create a better viewing experience. That being said, I did enjoy the story of this film. It was engaging and had some twists that I think worked pretty well, although the ending did leave me with a few questions.

Nathan,9.0,"Babylon is debauchery at its finest. It encapsulates an era like no other and dares to be so different, yet so appealing. On the surface this film is a very straightforward plot, following our three leads and their attempts at success in the ever-changing world of cinema. But deep down, there is another message that is so relevant to everyone's life: accepting death/irrelevance.

Just as fast as our characters achieve their dreams of being stars in the industry, these dreams are quickly whisked away by the brutality and cutthroat nature of Hollywood. This is juxtaposed with Brad Pitts character, a man already on downward spiral of his career, trying to desperately hold on to what remains. These arches are so honest and vulnerable, I found very compelling.

The performances were top notch all around, and I would expect nothing more from a stacked cast of actors including Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt. But the surprise of the bunch was Diego Calva. He was fantastic and stole many scenes he was featured in with both Robbie and Pitt. He is the true lead of this film and does an excellent job bearing the load.

I really enjoyed almost aspects of the film, but towards the end there are some sequences that I feel got away from Chazelle. They are so over the top and kind of feal out of place in this somewhat grounded story. The tension is there in these scenes, but it just doesn't fit. This whole subplot could have been shorten tremendously helping reduce the bloated runtime of the film.

That being, I never really felt the length of this picture with it being quite well paced. Overall, this movie was real treat, and it is quite a shame that marketing was jumbled up so poorly because this film deserves viewership.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"It's a sort of triptych of stories of Hollywood, this. A tale that starts off with all the excesses and hedonism of the cocaine fuelled, sexually lascivious antics where even an elephant isn't too much for a party hosted by a movie mogul. It's here we meet the three characters who provide the thread for the rest of this maelstrom of a movie. Firstly we have the young, naive, but quick-thinking ""Manny"" (Diego Calva) who manages to attract the attention of the much-married, established and former silent screen star ""Jack Conrad"" (Brad Pitt) all whilst Margot Robbie's ambitious and outrageous ""Nellie LaRoy"" is sniffing, snorting, dancing and generally sexifying everything she touches as she bids to get into the acting business. What now ensues is a really well crafted and thoughtfully entertaining tale of the rise and fall and rise and fall of these three characters and of how their success brings failure as surely as the sun comes up. Robbie is on excellent form, a truly convincing performance as a character ill-equipped for the journey she is so determined to undertake. Pitt, likewise, plays well here. His character has less in the way of shock factor to deliver, but that storyline offers us a rather more effectively stolid appreciation of just how fickle success can be: there, then gone - in what might seem like a blind of the eye. Finally, the aspirational but (initially) more measured, head-screwed-on Calva who falls in love, and ends up trying to fight the inevitable like King Canute! There's a quirky effort from Tobey Maguire, an alligator and a rat-eater; and a rather scene-stealing contribution - especially at the end - from Jean Smart's Hedda Hopper-style gossip journalist ""Elinor St. John"" - possibly the only honest character in the entire thing! It's a pastiche and/or an homage to all things cinema at a time of the gradual emergence and then dominance of sound pictures, and we are frequently exposed to the car-crash lifestyles as everyone adapted, re-adapted, and continued to stay on their toes as their industry and their audiences did not always want to take everyone with them - and at break neck speed too - as tastes changed. It's got everything from Cecil B DeMille to Baz Luhrmann to it, takes a swipe at the pompous-thinking stage theatricals (from the East Coast), the shallowness of the whole industry - and yet, it never loses a sense the these are still people. Human beings! It is not difficult to imagine Kenneth Anger advising on the script - it ""could"" all be true"". Maybe a bit on the long side, it certainly sags now and again - but it's definitely a big screen experience that delivers solid, engaging performances that are not over reliant on - even, rather comically (and dangerously) illustrating just how films were made before - CGI! No point in waiting for this to come to television - it's a must for the cinema around which it's story is told.",2023-01-23T12:35:35.790Z,615777,4 stars,0.5324286222457886

The Movie Mob,6.0,"**Avatar: The Way of Water follows in its predecessor’s footsteps with stunning effects and a mediocre story.**

It’s a James Cameron film, so it’s impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na’vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na’vi learns to be ocean Na’vi and then fight Stephen Lang. But the new movie also focuses on a group of annoying teens that constantly get themselves in trouble and peril over and over again throughout the much too long 3+ hour runtime and sidelining better, more established characters. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original at every turn. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that’s all it is.",2022-12-16T06:48:15.541Z,76600,3 stars,0.5798948407173157
Manuel São Bento,7.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/avatar-the-way-of-water-spoiler-free-review

""Avatar: The Way of Water clearly sets itself apart from other blockbusters, building on 13 years of preparation to deliver a memorable CINEMA experience by the one and only James Cameron.

A visually, technically breathtaking adventure, particularly in the truly stunning underwater sequences. Score (Simon Franglen) remains epic, and the genuine dynamics between the characters of the Sully family lead the viewer to strongly, emotionally invest in them - the performances of the cast, namely Zoe Saldaña, are vital for the film's success.

Too bad the recycled, generic narrative doesn't keep up with the creativity, dedication, and innovation levels allocated to the technical elements. Underwhelming to the point of making the three-hour runtime feel heavier than it should, but for fans of the original - which remains supreme - it's far from ruining one of the year's must-see theater experiences.""

The characters seem to come out of the screen and it seems to witness the events firsthand. The world of Na&#39;vi has changed and is once again in danger. Man is the cause of evil as in reality. We are destroying our planet that used to be our Pandora. Pandora is our home, we are Pandora. The houses of the Na&#39;vi look like the tents of the American Indians, for me this is no coincidence and recalls the genocide of the American Indians. In my opinion it is a good sequel that deals with very relevant themes such as love, family and mourning. The initial water monologue which then returns towards the end is very poetic and universal! Emotional film that in some parts makes you cry. I recommend viewing in 3D for those who have already seen the previous film and were fascinated by that amazing world and the protagonist&#39;s love and life story.",2022-12-17T21:59:01.040Z,76600,4 stars,0.7430123090744019
TimeZone,10.0,"**My rating: 10/10**
Why? I rate any movie based on a few things. Warning! Potential Spoilers.

**1. Story**. Is the story compelling, does it stick in your mind after the movie, haunting you like a ghost, forcing you to think about it and even your own life? Does it have any positive messages aka moral of the story.

The story of The Way of Water is indeed compelling. The Conflict is multifaceted. Family conflict, Human-Na'vi conflict, Tribal Conflict and most importantly, personal conflict, aka identity conflict. The identity conflict is mostly fuelled by outcast feeling. There are a lot of people including Jake who at some point feel like they don't belong. I believe most people feel this way at some point in life, you don’t need to be in the protected minority groups for you to feel like an outcast. And while we may not be accepted for who we are, defining who are begins with ourselves first. Our world is full of people who want to be identified in one way or another. But have they identified themselves first? Just remember, most people feel discriminated for one reason or another in life. Religion, gender, skin colour, country, body size or smartness in school, political affiliation. Nobody gets love all round all times. Know who you are and don’t fuss to much about it. Learn a losson from Spider (Miles Socorro).

**2. Characters**. Are there likeable characters you can get attached to? Characters you remember later, characters that inspire. Characters that grow.
Spidey is a new character, and he has a great story to tell. Jake has changed a lot too and for good reason. People undergo a lot of transformation in life. You can’t be what Don Williams calls a Rake and Ramblin’ Man your entire life. I read an article review complaining how Jake tucked his tail and ran. That review completely missed the point. Jakes decision may not have been the right one, but put in his situation, it is a decision that a lot of people would make. 

**3. Acting**. Is the acting good? Is it realistic enough to be believable to a point you forget the people are just acting? I was more than impressed by Neytiri’s “gone nuts” scene. I felt her pain, and in that instance, I was nuts too. I honestly forgot this was just a movie. Actors can make you cry, and that is just how it should be. You forget that it is just an act, no need to cry. I also read an article that complained about the dialogue of the teenagers. I don’t know what the reviewer expected. Philosophy from teens? Their conversation is believable enough for their age.

**4. Everything tied together**. A good story told by good and believable characters needs a setup. Something to tie them together into a bundle.  Avatar ties everything together with wonderful visuals. I don’t need to say more.",2022-12-19T06:28:23.198Z,76600,3 stars,0.26705363392829895
Chris Sawin,4.0,"State-of-the-art special effects, revolutionary underwater cameras, and the resurrection of what is otherwise a mostly forgotten movie theater format can’t hide the fact that _Avatar: The Way of Water_ is basically the same movie as the original with more blue people (some are slightly green now!) that get on your last nerve. The emotion in the film feels forced and the story is like swapping a blue thread for a green one as it threads the same, withered fabric from 2009. This is a special effects extravaganza with nauseating results that only partially impresses and mostly succumbs to being its own biggest fanatic.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Well we ought not to have expected ""Jake"" (Sam Worthington) and ""Neytiri"" (Zoe Saldana) to have let the grass grow during the intervening years since we were first introduced to the idyllic world of ""Pandora"". Now with four children and their human friend ""Spider"" (Jack Champion - remember Johnny Sheffield?), they are living life to the full. Until, that is, one night they see a new star in the sky. Star? Well, no - it's the ships announcing the return of the human beings, this time even more bent on the conquest of their planet now that the Earth is finally on it's knees. Armed to the hilt with the latest technology and weaponry, and commanded by the essence of the departed ""Col. Quaritch"" - who also now leads a squad of Na'vi-esque avatars of his own - things look ominous for the ""Sully"" family. Realising that they are front and centre for their persecutors, they relocate to (saddle themselves on) a remote, water-based community where they hope, rather unrealistically, to be able to sit it out... This is undoubtedly a beautiful piece of cinema to watch. 3D and IMAX with a classily crafted score from Simon Franglen and a message that trumpets the cruciality of the symbiotic relationships between all creatures that live on a world where co-operation and understanding are vital to the survival of all. Thing is, though, that all of that glorious cinematography starts to get just a bit repetitive after about an hour and the middle portion of this really does drag. Indeed, were this to have been a long ""Blue Planet"" style documentary alerting us to the dangers of mankind's rampant abuse of resources with scant regard to the implications for any other species, then I would have enjoyed it better in three parts with Sir David Attenborough's mellifluous narration. It isn't though, and the story is stretched so terribly thinly that - sorry, sacrilege I know - I was actually bored a bit. It does pick up for the last forty minutes or so as the denouement provides for loads of action-packed pyrotechnics but to be honest, I had sort of lost interest by that point. Certainly, it is a great looking film that offers us food for thought, but as a story - I thought it weak, predictable and at times it does just a little too much of it's own recycling. Indeed - had their children actually done what they were told in the first place, there might not have been much of a story at all!

Nathan,-1.0,"Avatar: The Way of Water is a visual spectacle from start to finish. The scenery, cinematography, and CGI constantly had a smile on my face, but is it enough to carry the film?

While the previous entry had its fair share of story-related problems, the sequel corrects most of my issues and delivers a heartfelt family story. The main improvement from the first entry is character development. I had a genuine emotional connection with the Sully family and was invested in their safety. These feelings created some genuine tension when any of the family members were in danger, I felt my body tense up as I waited to see what the conflict's conclusion would be, which is a gigantic improvement from the first film where I could not care less who died or survived.

The return of Stephan Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch brought the overly campy villain back to the screen in a bad way. Quaritch is a caricature of a ""villain"" where his actions and attitude are evil for the sake of being the bad guy. His anger toward Jake Sully does seem a little bit more believable hear as his previous self was murdered by him, but the over-the-top theatrics are just too much for me.

Another aspect of the story that did not feel right to me was the children constantly disobeying their parents for the sake of plot progression. Countless times, Jake Sully's kids would do the opposite of what they were told, leaving them in a vulnerable state to be captured. This danger forced Jake Sully to constantly expose himself and help draw the threat ever closer to his family. The moments that result are great as we get to see the dichotomy between Jake being a father and his militaristic background. This is at the heart of the story and worked for me.

I was surprised to see how well-paced the film was despite its over three-hour runtime. There are some pretty slow parts, specifically the second act, but the visuals and the character journeys that happen during these parts are so interesting that they didn't impact me negatively; I was just happy to see new and beautiful aspects of Pandora.

The performances were fantastic throughout. It is a testament to both the actors/actresses and also the technology that can display such complex emotions and visual nuances on entirely CGI creatures. Sigourney Weaver was a highlight with Kiri, who was at the forefront of the entire film. To be completely honest, I did not even know she was played by Weaver; the mix between her performance and voice modulation created a compelling 14-year-old girl that was a huge part of the story. Sam Worthington was incredible and Zoe Saldana was perfect. Saldana does so much acting with her facial expressions as Ney'tirl, which is on display during many emotional scenes her character goes through. She was a bit sidelined during this film, but when she was on screen, she was impactful.

Avatar has some incredibly heavy themes at play. One of the strongest and most relevant messages was anti-poaching. I mention this because there was such a hard scene in this movie that had me on the verge of tears. It was something I'd never seen in the film; it was both beautiful in the brutality it displayed and the emotional response of the Na'vi.

Overall, this movie is deserving of the hype and needs to be seen on the biggest screen available. James Cameron delivered on the 13 years build-up to the sequel and has gotten me excited for the three sequels planned for the next decade.

JonathanWiddup,9.0,"Like, how am I supposed to watch movies that take place on earth now?? 

Now that I’ve seen Avatar the way of water… it feels a bit… strange. I expected to be overwhelmed but the scale and scope of the film, I expected to have a good headache. But none of that happened. I have a very different feeling… I feel… Proud. Proud knowing that my faith in this film payed off. Proud that this film was indeed epic. Its not a perfect movie and I do have my flaws. But this film gave me about everything I could ask for when it comes to a movie going experience, this deserves to make serious money at the box. James Cameron said in his interviews that he is the ONLY person that could direct an avatar film, and the internets response was “James… Chill”, here’s the thing, he was right. I cannot imagine another director doing something like this. Everything you love from Cameron is here, Terminator 2, Titanic, etc. 
This was the best looking movie I’ve ever seen.. and no other film will match this in the future that isn’t an Avatar sequel. The VFX on the characters and creatures was perfect, no problems whatsoever. Sometimes some landscapes might have looked a little off, but the worst looking shot in this movie still looks better then almost every other CGI heavy action film. The underwater sequences  was awe inspiring, I could’ve watched the underwater sequences in this film forever. the amount of work put into the underwater sequences definitely paid off. At first I wasn’t so sure about 48fps, during the first 20 or so minutes, I thought I would be detracted the whole time, but I wasn’t, I adjusted about half an hour in, and was completely emerged into a film like I never have before. 
The action in this movie was insane, the action was always at and 11 out of 10. You felt the scale, the weight, the stakes. 
Like I said, this wasn’t a perfect film. When the movie started, I was so sure about how I would feel about this movie. It starts voiceover heavy and with lots of quick cuts as if a lot has been cut from the film within the opening, Im sure there will be an extended cut to this, and I’m curious if it will add to it. The dialogue in the first film was the best, and this film does have stronger dialogue. But there are still a couple scenes where it did feel a little off, but it was mostly with the younger characters. As it wasn’t Constant, it was just like a line here to there every 20 minutes or so. While, I did say that the opening needed a little more to it, there are chucks in the middle that didn’t need to be there, and was just there to be eye candy, but it wasn’t really a big issue with me, Cause it was some of the best eye candy ever put on film.
I’m tired of people complaining about the story to these avatar films, it feels like people put the plot to these movies on a unrealistic standard. The plot here is basic, and yeah, it might feel a little to basic at Times. But I don't really think it was something worth mentioning critically. 
Overall, this was a perfectly crafted film with a pretty good script, that provided a theater experience I’ll never forget.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,7.0,"Avatar 2 or Avatar: The Way of the Water came out on 4K Blu-ray a couple of weeks ago so me and the kids finally got around to watch it last weekend. I rarely go to the cinemas nowadays. It’s just too much hassle and way to expensive for four people. But there’s also no way I watch a big movie like Avatar on streaming with their over-compressed images and mediocre sound. Yeah, yeah, I know they claim Dolby Atmos and all that but they use almost one tenth the bit-rate for the video compared to 4K Blu-ray and push the Atmos over a lossy Dolby Digital stream.

Anyway, enough rambling. Avatar: The Way of the Water was better than I feared it would be. I was really worried that it would turn out to be a preachy woke turd. Especially with some of the comments Cameron has made lately.

Sure, it was pretty much a repeat of the first one with the companies bad, humans bad an all that kind of story but at least that was about it. There was not really any of the usual preaching, finger pointing and general woke force feeding that has been way too common from Hollywood lately.

The main enjoyment of this movie is really the imagery, the scenery, the fantastic creatures and all that. It is a visually very beautiful movie.

The second part of the enjoyment comes from some quite enjoyable action sequences, especially towards the end of the movie.

The story is not much to write home about though. It is pretty standard, unimaginative story fairly full of the usual Hollywood lazy-ass unplausible shit. The idea that humanity in the future would go to another planet and start to hunt down the wildlife, behave like some conquistadors and literally strip the planet is fairly ludicrous from the start of course.

The story is not so much about the main characters, or at least what I expected to be the main characters, but more about the kids. I was expecting it to be about the Na’vi kicking the invaders’ asses…again, but unfortunately the movie takes a different track rather early on.

After that it is more of a coming of age story about their kids who, also unfortunately, behaves like the usual Hollywood teenagers in not listening to their parents and generally behaving recklessly. This part of the movie would have been really, really, boring if it was not for the beautiful scenery.

Then there was this idea of an intelligent species, supposedly more intelligent than humans, being not only pacifists but refuses to defend themselves in any way while literally being exterminated. That kind of stupid shit only exists in the mind of a Hollywood writer. They also conveniently looked like whales so the script writer could push some bad-humans-catching-whales stereotypes.

And why did they have to drag back the main the main asshole from the first movie? It just felt lazy and did not add to my enjoyment of the movie.

Still, the bottom line is that I did enjoy the movie, even though it was over three hours long which felt a little bit dragged out. It is in no way this super blockbuster that some people seem to think though. At least not as far as I am concerned.",2023-07-26T16:53:49.944Z,76600,3 stars,0.5134668350219727

tmdb69341833,5.0,"I don't mind the repetition of the first movie's plot. To be frank, I couldn't care less. I've only ever watched these movies for the visuals.

But the part of the story that rubbed me the wrong way the most in this movie, Is Neytiri. Home girl is basically non-existent and unimportant up until the movie's finale when she, like a boss, battered and severely fucks up some of the human soldiers. 

But during the rest of the movie, she is reduced as a character to give room for Jake Sully's ""father of the year"" decision making throughout the movie. Like the writers really wanted to give Jake a ""good father"" story arc; he's the defender, protector, man of the household type shit. Like it's honestly giving 50s housewife and her only job is to bare Jake's kids and raise them while daddy Jake is busy alpha male-ing around. Don't even get me started on that.

Like from the first movie, I still don't understand why they let a literal outsider just be the head of their tribe. Again, Neytiri would have been more qualified. She is literally a more skilled fighter that Jake and is the most capable in their tribe as well as the fact that she is just naturally an alpha. It's just a fact proven time and time again. But it is never shed light on because of Jake's plot armor, and let me tell you it is strong. Like if he wasn't the white savior of the movie, he would have ended up like Tsu'tey, Neytiri's brother, and that's just facts.

Overall, besides it's underlying sexist demeanors and tones, not a one hundred percent terrible movie though I personally won't probably watch it again if I don't have to due to the ick I have with the ""main character"", but give it a watch. You'll probably like it more than me. 

My favorite part of the movie by the way is when the whales.
My least favorite part of the movie is when Neytiri is not on screen besides when the whales.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"""Hilary"" (Olivia Colman) is the shift leader at a grand old cinema living a routine life and largely just going through the motions each day. When the young ""Stephen"" (a strong and engaging performance from Micheal Ward) arrives, she takes him on a tour of the building and that takes them to the upper echelons of the building - now disused - where they discover an injured pigeon. They also discover something else, and soon are having bit of a clandestine affair. Thing is, she's also having one of those with her boss ""Ellis"" (Colin Firth) and keeping secrets amongst her small team isn't the easiest! Things come to an head, however, when some fascist thugs are marauding down the local esplanade and they see the young man through the locked doors. Soon, he is in hospital and everyone is having to re-evaluate their relationships and priorities - and it's at this point that ""Hilary"" comes off the rails a little. Years of resentment and frustration - coupled with a bit of booze - all come to the fore just as her young friend comes to some conclusions about his own future too! Toby Jones is wonderful here as the projectionist, allowing the intensity of the personal stories to be diffused with a nostalgic look back at just how (even as recently as the 1980s) films were synched from a series of projectors, with cue dots and played from reels. He (""Norman"") even demonstrates to the enthusiastic young ""Stephen"" as we go. The themes of racism, tolerance, ageism and ignorance are never far from the surface, though, and essentially this film is a cleverly nuanced piece of drama that uses a cinema - itself a conduit for so many different aspects of human life and behaviour - to serve as the focus for a brief observation of two lives that overlap for a while. It does have some sentiment to it - but for me that was about the old days of cinema gone by; otherwise this is a complex and thought-provoking look at life in Mrs. Thatcher's Britain long before she had had any real chance to mould it...",2023-02-10T13:07:45.326Z,814757,4 stars,0.47019463777542114

""The Whale earns its place in the ""most tearful films of the year"" list as it moves slowly yet efficiently towards its overwhelmingly emotional ending, especially elevated by the most subtly powerful & irrefutably moving performance of Brendan Fraser's career.

Darren Aronofsky presents a depressing, passionate, and, above all, brutally honest story about trauma, acceptance, and positivity. The filmmaker's lack of restraint may be a trigger for some, but the impact of his messages couldn't be more memorable.

Nathan,8.0,"The Whale is a heart breaking story of our main character, Charlie (Brendon Fraser), as he tries to make amends for abandoning his daughter. Charlie is obese, an ailment that has manifested itself as a coping mechanism for a life of regret. In every scene and interaction this regret is worn by Charlie as a cloak of his past that will stay with him until his dying breath. This character is an immense undertaking and Brendon Fraser plays him perfectly. The emotion he delivers is palpable, which lends itself so seamlessly to scenes of raw sadness and despair. Not only is Fraser a highlight, but the entire supporting cast does an excellent job. Hong Chau is superb, and despite her tough, no nonsense, science focused exterior hides a deep and genuine connection with Charlie. She is incredibly hurt by the way he is treating his body, but is defenseless to his desires, resulting in her to continually feed his addiction. It is a brutal back and forth that is tackled with immense care. Sadie Sink is great as well, she is delivers a brutal performance that leaves the character of Ellie easily hatable with very little redeemable qualities. I understand that this was the point of her character, and by no means is this a knock on Sink's performance, but it felt like a bit much. She was too cruel, to the point of unbelievability, which took a bit away from the message that was trying to be delivered. The pace was a bit slow for my liking. I felt as if the Thomas subplot was a bit pointless and could have been cut from the movie with no ill effects. But despite my minor complaints, the movie is carried by fantastic performances, amazing cinematography and intense emotions that will leave many viewers pleased with their experience, but will not be for everyone.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Yikes, but this second gay-themed outing for Brendan Fraser could hardly be more different from his 1998 ""Gods and Monsters"" one. Here his is the critically obese ""Charlie"" who has grown to a size where his health is in tatters and he has virtually no mobility as he regularly consumes two large pizzas for dinner and two great meatball subs for lunch. We learn quite quickly a little of what initially drove this man to this level of despair and as things begin to look terminal, we share his aspirations to reconcile with his daughter whom he left eight years earlier to be with his gay lover ""Allan"". Now for all I thought Fraser was superb in this film, I found Sadie Sink's performance as the truly selfish, conniving and odious daughter ""Ellie"" (upon whom he rather dotes) stole this for me. At times I really did want to shoot her! Ty Simpkins also does well as the well meaning god-squadder who finds his association with this dysfunctional family helps open his eyes too. Hong Chau performs well as his long suffering friend/nurse/confidante ""Liz"", and as mortality looms the characters are drawn into an increasingly angry, hostile environment that is full of bitterness, rancour and regret certainly, but maybe - just maybe - the slightest hint of reconciliation. Fraser will never deliver another performance like this again. Sure, his size and generally slothful demeanour are so far from the hale-fellow-well-met series of characters we have seen thus far in his career that they are bound to have an effect. His acting, though, is honest and emotional. His character is torn and distraught and he conveys that potently, especially in the scenes with his obnoxious daughter. The plot has an inevitability to it, which doesn't usually work so well for me - but here, it helps focus on the few interlinked stories and characters allowing little room for distraction. It's not without it's humour now and again, either. I've deliberately avoided reading about how he got to that size - somehow, knowing might spoil what is undoubtedly a tour de force from both him and Miss Sink. Brave and uncompromising - well worth a watch.",2023-02-09T11:29:10.110Z,785084,3 stars,0.5011926293373108
r96sk,10.0,"I doubt I can add much more to what has already been said about <em>'The Whale'</em>, but in a word: Bravo!

Brendan Fraser truly is sensational in this role. I heard about all the acclaim and seen a few of the standing ovations he has received and all I can say is that it is unequivocally deserved. Truly outstanding from the first scene (yes, even with that... ha) to the very last. It's great to see the dude that I first saw as a kid in <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/george-of-the-jungle/"">George of the Jungle</a>'</em> well and truly back in the game.

One thing about Fraser getting all the (undoubtedly merited) plaudits from this Darren Aronofsky flick is that I didn't know what to expect from the support cast, and man are there some absolutely stellar performances behind Fraser. Sadie Sink, Ty Simpkins and Samantha Morton are top notch, though Hong Chau is a cut above that trio - brilliant stuff from her!

There are some powerful scenes in there. I'm not one to cry with fictional works (my brain automatically knows it's 'fake', I can't help it) but man even I got major goosebumps and gut punches (pardon the pun?) from what's portrayed onscreen. Fraser, and Chau, are naturally the major reasons for that, but everyone - on and off the screen - deserves big props for this 2022 film.

Ahmetaslan27,9.0,"write something honest

Any movie directed by Darren Aronofsky contains a lot of violent scenes that are unfamiliar and hard on the eyes to see. Darren Aronofsky is a director whose work must be eagerly awaited because one of his films, Requiem of Dream 2000, is one of my favorites.

The most important event in the movie The Whale is the star Brendan Fraser, after suffering from many health problems, especially with the spine, and was forced to perform surgeries, in addition to the withdrawal of lights and fame from him, and his playing movie roles that didn't achieve wide success.

Brendan Fraser played a terrible role that deserves an Academy Award due to his genius performance, and you do not expect this wonderful acting performance from him, especially since he is an actor who is very good at comedy roles. He did a lot of dramatic work, but he didn't reach perfection like the one in the movie The Whale.

This amazing drama was like a oneman show although the other actors did well but the main reason for my admiration for the movie is Brendan Fraser. It was the make-up and the way the breathing was unbelievable and it's mind blowing how someone can pull off such a role

The film was shot in only one location, with the exception of the flashback scenes. Sadie Sink It was provocative from the first minutes, getting on your nerves and pushing you to throw something on the visual medium through which you watch the movie, whether it is a mobile phone, a laptop, or even in theaters.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,9.0,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

_This film was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival_

When thinking about “The Whale,” I feel it’s important to start at the end rather than the beginning because the melodramatic finale almost ruins everything that’s good about the film. The finale is grossly manipulative, corny, excessive, and if what came before wasn’t so great, it would diminish director Darren Aronofsky’s entire project. Thanks to a heartbreaking script (from writer Samuel D. Hunter) and a once-in-a-lifetime lead performance from Brendan Fraser, it takes little effort to overlook the film’s more negative aspects.

Based on Hunter’s 2012 play of the same name, the psychological drama tells the story of Charlie (Fraser), a reclusive English professor who is living with severe obesity. Weighing over 600 pounds and unable to leave his home, Charlie spends his days alone in his small, dingy apartment with intermittent visits from his friend and nurse Liz (Hong Chau), who is his only companion. It’s been an interesting week for the man, as he’s had two additional unexpected visitors: a religious missionary (Ty Simpkins) who is compelled to continue his visits, and Charlie’s estranged and hostile teenager daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink). With his health in grave decline (he repeatedly refuses to seek care at a hospital), Charlie decides to do everything in his power to gain one last chance at redemption in his daughter’s eyes, and every ounce of time he has left is spent reconnecting with her.

The film takes place in a confined space, and the lead character spends the majority of his time sitting on a sofa. This cramped setting feels suffocating, which in turn conveys the feelings that Charlie is also experiencing. This is a story about empathy, and it’s admittedly challenging at first glance to feel a ton of compassion for Charlie no matter how accepting you may think you are or claim to be. His outward appearance is shocking and repellant, and it’s part of human nature to look at him as if he were a freak show attraction. What’s interesting about the film is that it digs deeper beneath Charlie’s obesity and lets you into his heart. I was surprised to find by the end of the story just how much I had grown to care so deeply for him.

Folks who have seen the film and are crying that it is “fat shaming” are missing the point. This isn’t a story about humiliation or degradation, it’s a film about actually seeing the person inside a repulsive exterior and giving them humanity. This is not a project that mocks obesity, as has so often (and sadly) been the case with many Hollywood films. This is a story with substantial and challenging themes about depression, mental illness, and addiction. In this case, Charlie has spent years self-medicating his despair and unhappiness with food, and is now suffering from an eating disorder that has raged out of control.

None of this would be so emotionally touching if not for Fraser’s lead performance. He is impressive and outstanding as Charlie, and it’s one of the greatest cinematic performances in years (and definitely of the actor’s career). It’s not the spectacle of the makeup or fat suit that makes him memorable: it’s how Fraser thoroughly embodies Charlie with a deep, soulful pain in his eyes. His performance absolutely ripped my heart right out of my chest to the point where I found it difficult to breathe. He’s _that_ good.

While there’s been so much talk about Fraser, Chau’s performance is equally heartbreaking. Through her facial expressions and body language, you can see and feel the pain Charlie is causing Liz. Everyone is simply waiting for the man to die, and you’re right there by Liz’s side as she cares for her best friend in a final act of selfless affection. It’s an agonizing thing to watch and experience, and Chau conveys her torment in an understated, poignant way.

If it sounds like this is a tough film to watch, I will assure you that it is. You won’t leave the theater floating on air when it’s over. This is an adult drama that will leave you in tears with its story of resentment, vulnerability, regret, and humanity. That’s also why “The Whale” is one of the very best films of the year.",2023-04-23T06:41:14.611Z,785084,2 stars,0.42535755038261414
Peter McGinn,7.0,"At least partly because this movie was based on a play, most of the action takes place in one room. Of course, the nature of the character’s health issues makes it hard for him to move around, but I think the limited setting worked against the film. Maybe it is just my eyes getting older, but the cinematography of The Whale seems to follow the current trend of being dark, dark, dark. Are they desperate to show the mood through lighting, were they trying to simulate the inside of a whale’s stomach, or is it less expensive to film in the gloomy interiors, or what? Would it kill them to turn on a light now and again?

Anyway, the movie tugs at the appropriate heartstrings and throws a curve here and there, and is an excellent work of drama noir.",2023-04-25T22:42:34.017Z,785084,3 stars,0.4585931599140167
Nathan,9.0,"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish had a lot to live up to as most of my critic and casual friends have been praising the film, and for the most part the film delivers.

From the opening frames, the unique art style fills the screen and is incredibly captivating. There is some excellent combination of 3D animation with 2D styles that I have not seen before. The combat frame rate shift was also a nice touch that worked better than I was expecting. Action was top notch with some incredible set pieces and superb choreography.

The Last Wish deals with some pretty heavy themes for an animated children's movie. Death is something that all humans will have to face which was handled in such a nuanced and mature way here. From panic attacks to haunting imagery, death looms large throughout the entire film and serves as a menacing villain. The journey our heroes take to confront this fear is very heartwarming and will resonant with most audience members.

With most DreamWorks pictures, the comedy is targeted at both children and adults. I did find myself laughing out loud at plenty of jokes, but just as many landed flat for me. This would be more of an issue, but this is an incredibly balanced film with great action and dramatic moments that leave little room for a few flat jokes to make a large impact on my experience.

I genuinely believe that this movie has restored the Shrek universe and can propel the future projects upward. Hype has officially been restored for Shrek 5!

ravundwa,10.0,"I did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off Dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. But here we are.

After an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.

The screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.

What I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.

I adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year.",2023-02-05T13:43:05.151Z,315162,4 stars,0.5490116477012634
CinemaSerf,7.0,"I can't think for a minute that this would have worked at all, had it not for been for the entertainingly over-the-top voice talents of Antonio Banderas in the title roll. His cat is a sort of combination of Cyrano de Bergerac and Casanova - full of flair, dashing and adept with his flourishing blade. Until, that is, he has a run-in with a church bell that brings him face to face with his mortality. He has only one of his nine lives left, and death is poised to come claim him! Shattered, he seeks refuge in a home for cats where he encounters ""Perrito"" - a small, naive and lost little dog who is determined to befriend him. Meantime, the not so little ""Jack Horner"" and ""Goldilocks"" and her three bears are looking for a map that will guide them to a wishing star that, well, it does what it says on the tin. The bears decide to track down our eponymous hero to help them procure it, but he and his feline rival ""Kitty"" (and their new doggy pal) decide to join forces and must face a series of tortuous escapades in the race to succeed in their quest. It must be 45 years since I last read the ""Goldilocks"" story and try as I might, I just couldn't remember it as it gradually evolves as one of the threads of this enjoyably crafted montage of fable and charisma. It's pretty action packed with Banderas proving his singing hasn't really improved much since ""Evita"" (1996). It's a family movie for sure with messages of loyalty, affection, determination etc.; but there is still enough in the dialogue for those older folks in the auditorium to raise a smile and keep it interesting for 100 minutes. The animation is super and this character driven adventure is well worth seeing on a big screen if you can.

How does a movie this good get made today?  Isn't this sort of the opposite of everything that current Hollywood stands for?

How can they make a western movie that doesn't shame the west at every possible turn?

I have absolutely no idea how this could have been made, but what I can say is that it is fantastic, it is moving, it is fun for the whole family and it has a decent nonpolitical message.  The main character is heroic.

r96sk,9.0,"A sequel miles better than the (good) original - that's a rarity!

Those behind <em>'Puss in Boots: The Last Wish'</em> absolutely smashed it out the park with this one. I had heard murmurs of hype about it so was expecting it to be very good, yet it still managed to surpass my expectations. It features a great story with well utilised characters, of which there are quite a few.

Soon after hitting play I wasn't actually sure about the animation, for one Puss himself looked different to how I remember him from <em>'Shrek'</em>. However, those thoughts quickly disappeared because the style is, in fact, gorgeous. You can tell the people making this had heart in it, rather than just milking the IP for another installment.

Antonio Banderas remains a joy as Puss in Boots, a character that wouldn't be as memorable without him. Harvey Guillén comes in with a standout showing, I do think Perrito is the least interesting visually but the character (and voice) is what makes the dog a successful addition. John Mulaney (thought it was Zach Braff, ngl) is a positive newbie too.

Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo are also pluses, as are Salma Hayek and Wagner Moura. Evidently, it's a quality cast.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"""Santa"" (David Harbour) is getting a bit disillusioned with the whole Christmas thing. He is tired of delivering gifts to modern day children who live in an unappreciative, throw-away, culture and so has taken to the bottle rather. Leaving Bristol one night, he rather drunkenly crash-lands thousands of miles away at the compound of the wealthy and therefore entirely dysfunctional ""LIghtstone"" family. Now here we have group of people ruled over by matriarch ""Gertrude"" (Beverly D'Angelo - who just reminded me of Goldie Hawn) who are dealing with their own issues of separation, avarice, precociousness and, yes, I too was already thinking - same old, same old... Wait, though, it seems that this family are the target of some seriously nasty robbers who are after the $300 million hidden in an impenetrable vault in the cellar. ""Santa"", unwittingly, becomes embroiled in these shenanigans and after being initially desperate to get out of the place, he spots the terrified young ""Trudy"" (Leah Brady) and, well, someone's goose is about to be cooked! It can't resists wallowing a bit in sentiment at times, and the familial discord stuff is all very old hat, but when the action scenes kick in we are offered a sort of ""Home Alone"" (1990) meets ""Thor"" (2011) experience peppered with some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments as, of course, the plot follows it's own, very obvious course. It's violent and gory, but the fact that much of that emanates from this epitome of kindness and avuncularity makes this just a bit different - and quite entertaining - with Harbour carrying it off quite engagingly.

Nathan,7.0,"Violent Night was exactly what I was looking for heading into this movie. It is laugh-out-loud funny with spectacular action and brutal gory kills, a perfect blend for a Christmas film!

When David Harbor is on screen this movie works wonderfully. I never knew I needed a David Harbor Santa Claus, but now that we got it, I want to see more. He portrays a charming grumpy Santa wonderfully. His lack of care and worldview had me laughing in so many instances. This performance carried the film and was the only reason I was there.

Unfortunately, the writers tried to do a little too much with all the secondary characters. There are subplots sprinkled throughout that take away from the action adding unnecessary minutes to this film. This creates an unbalanced pace that jumps from interesting action to boring side character development, really messing with the flow. This film is nearly 2 hours long, and that length is felt at times. If these side plots were to be eliminated and we streamlined the action the film would have been all the better for it.

All in all, Violent Night effectively achieves its main goal and provides a brutal Christmas movie that I will be revisiting every season.

GenerationofSwine,10.0,"Yeah I'm going to give this top marks, not because it is really that good, but because it came out in 2022 and was probably the best thing in the theater at the time (which was probably why the other Movie Data Base started deleting positive reviews of it).  

But a lot of it is done right, it features an interracial family but doesn't make the race a key part of the story.  In fact, it doesn't even mention it at all.  Instead it follows the story of a little girl and Santa. 

And the Santa is a bit weird, there is a lot of things that just don't fit with his character, but that doesn't matter because the story is just so fun that you willingly suspend most of your disbelief.

It is violent and does a great job of making the violence both exciting and at times comical.  It drops Easter eggs in some of the best possible ways.  Not all the men are evil and idiotic and not all the women are practically perfect in every way.  They are just written as, well, as unique characters.

And you really have to appreciate it in 2022 when most movies drop characters for checked boxes.

One of the standout elements of the movie was its fresh take on Santa Claus, avoiding the pitfalls of being overly silly or ridiculous. Instead, the film presented a fun and exciting interpretation of the character, adding a new dimension to the holiday season and delivering an enjoyable viewing experience.

David Harbour's performance in the film showcased his talent as an actor, demonstrating his ability to bring depth and complexity to any character he portrays. His portrayal added a layer of intrigue and captivation to the storyline, keeping audiences engaged from start to finish.

I highly recommend watching ""Violent Night"" for its action-packed scenes, creative storytelling, and the stellar performance by David Harbour. Whether you view it as an action horror comedy or a unique Christmas film, the movie offers a versatile and enjoyable viewing experience that will leave you entertained and wanting more.",2024-09-02T19:55:28.606Z,899112,4 stars,0.6690658926963806

""Enola Holmes 2 maintains the levels of light, adventurous fun of the original, surpassing it due to a much more cohesive, intriguing central narrative, in addition to overall better pacing. The different storylines mesh together nicely, and Harry Bradbeer's distinctive visual style remains a standout.

Millie Bobby Brown shines as Enola, as does Henry Cavill as Sherlock - the latter even too much, sometimes stealing the spotlight from a female-empowered story partially based on a real event with a significant impact on the evolution of women's rights.

Highly recommend it as a weekend viewing.""

I have similar thoughts about <em>'Enola Holmes 2'</em> as I do for <em>'Enola Holmes'</em>. Millie Bobby Brown is a strong lead, the support cast are good but the plot still isn't the most entertaining to watch unfold onscreen. I'm not sure it needed to be told over 2hrs, either.

Still, I got the required amount of entertainment from it. I appreciate the message and the story it tells, as well as them (seeming to, to me anyway) toning down the fourth-wall breaking - which is a tad overdone in the 2020 flick.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"""Jack"" (Adam Driver) is a college lecturer married to ""Babbette"" (Greta Gerwig). It's fourth time round for both of them so their family consists a mix of siblings, half-siblings and pets that could easily give the Tower of Babel a run for it's money. Add to that mix that he teaches about Adolf Hitler (but cannot speak German) and she has developed a secret dependency on a mysterious drug (""Dylar"") and the scene is set for a dysfunctional family drama that I'm afraid to say left me yawning. The structure of the drama is pretty episodic in nature and the escapades themselves frequently border on the nonsensical (and implausible) as they have to comprehend and flee from the effects of an ""airborne toxic event"". Some of that is funny, some of that is not - and I'm not sure the entire concept can really sustain the 2¼ hours Noah Baumbach provides for us here. At times it comes across as ridiculously contrived, the humour and scenarios straining at the bit to be imaginative or inventive, but ending up, intellectually, face down in a ditch. Too many directors nowadays appear to me to challenge the audience to comprehend an increasing degree of nonsense or surreality almost daring us to ask ""What's this all about?"". Revealing ourselves idiots when we haven't really any clue? There are certainly constituent elements of this that raise a smile, and Driver continues to grow in confidence with each of the quirkier roles (remember ""Annette"" from 2021) he undertakes, but this is just a rambling mess of a story that offers us a surfeit of irritating dialogue underpinned by a story that plays to paranoia and stereotype in equal measure without really offering us much of a stab at redemption or comprehension.

I was enjoying the first half the film; the unique dialogue structure was fresh and the suspense of the chemical event was intriguing. It had great social commentary and was funny to watch post pandemic. But after the second act the story spirals absurdity and it really hurts my overall enjoyment of the film.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"I was watching this thinking how much Alisha Weir's performance in the title role reminded me of Emma Watson's ""Hermione"" from back in 2001! Feisty and intelligent, she is sent by her parents to the ""Cruncher Hall"" school where she encounters ""Miss Trunchbull"" (Dame Emma Thompson). Now this is a teacher who would not have looked out of place working with King Herod at Christmas! The children live in fear of her, as do the staff - but as ""Matilda"" starts to bond with ""Miss Honey"" (Lashana Lynch) and realises her true potential, well - a rebellion is soon in the offing! It's a strong story this - Dahl addressed many issues of neglectful parenting, bullying, intimidation and sexual stereotyping and Tim Minchin puts much of that sentiment effectively to music with a clever and entertaining lyric. The almost unrecognisable Dame Emma is on top form exuding an almost ridiculous degree of menace as helped by her array of cctv cameras, she rules the school with a rod of iron. Weir really enters into the spirit of things - she puts her heart and soul into the enthusiastic, mischievous and engaging character and with some enjoyably choreographed ensemble dance numbers this all delivers well. It still has a bit of the theatrical to it, some of the production doesn't quite make the best use of the flexibility the big screen offers, but the toe-tapping ""Naughty"" and ""Revolting Children"" help put a smile on your face for a surprisingly quickly-paced two hours.",2022-12-03T10:12:58.309Z,668482,4 stars,0.6993348598480225

Their father is their coach and their mentor, and he drives them hard - but that might all prove to be for nought when a bomb comes crashing through the roof of their swimming pool and only narrowly avoids killing someone! Scared but determined, the family decide to enlist the help of their charismatic cousin Nizar (Ahmed Malek) and armed with some borrowed cash try to get from their home to Germany where they hope to find safety and continue their training. Thing is, they have no papers so after a brief flight to Istanbul, find themselves in the hands of the people smugglers who care little for their safety. Much of this interesting film is quite tough to watch, as it depicts the efforts of the three to beat the elements and the authorities to reach their goal - at times at quite considerable risk to themselves. It's all based on a true story so there is no actual jeopardy to their journey, but it is illustrative of just how perilous the whole process is; of how venal and exploitative some people can be of those in life-threatening predicaments and also of just how persevering the human spirit can be when faced with seemingly insurmountable odds. It features a fine supporting effort from ""Sven"" (Matthias Schweighöfer) and offers us quite a well produced and paced observation on just how these two girls got through their ordeal.

Marvel’s second Disney+ special is another success! This Guardians of the Galaxy special is much more kid-focused than Werewolf by Night, with the humor dipping into extreme goofball. Still, it is nice to laugh with some of the goofier characters of the Marvel Universe. The idea to bring Kevin Bacon into the MCU as himself was comedy genius, and the whole special ends with a sweet, sincere family feeling. I wouldn’t say this Holiday Special was as impressive as Werewolf by Night, but it was fun, and the quality and effects felt on par with the movies.

The writing for this special was pretty lackluster, there were more than a handful of lines that felt very awkward. I would question the acting, but we've seen and fell in love with these characters on the screen before, so the writing seems to be the culprit. Many of the Kevin Bacon and Kraglin's lines were cheesy and inorganic. I am not sure if that was the intent, but it just did not work for me.

The comedy is fantastic and hand me audibly laughing at many scenes. It was great to see the gang back together again and has me that much more excited for Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 3.

tmdb51616167,9.0,"Guardians of the Galaxy has solidified itself as an incredible franchise within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Volume 1: The creation of these characters injected suspense, excitement, and a generous dose of over-the-top comedy into the MCU. Chris Pratt's portrayal of Star-Lord was a fantastic choice, and the characters like Rocket and Groot became instant fan favorites, with merchandise flying off the shelves. While Nebula's transformation from antihero to hero was well-received, Gamora felt underutilized. Drax provided comic relief, but off-screen controversies involving the actor can affect viewers' perception of the character. Overall, the movie is enjoyable and worth watching.

Volume 2: While some may prefer the first installment, Volume 2 offers a deeper dive into the characters and more excitement. The film is wonderfully executed, providing a fantastic adventure that is highly recommended for its magical space journey and character development.

Volume 3: This installment returns to the original concept of Marvel, seamlessly connecting with other films in the MCU. The movie offers fantastic character development, ensuring each character shines without overshadowing the others. Star-Lord and Gamora remain central, but the film also explores Rocket's origin story exceptionally well. The ensemble cast, including Mantis, Nebula, Groot, and Drax, deliver standout performances. New additions like Cosmo and Blurp add charm, while Adam Warlock's portrayal, though slightly disappointing, is explained within the storyline. The film is emotional, with impactful end credit scenes, making it a must-watch in theaters.

Holiday Special: The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special is an exciting and enjoyable addition to the franchise, offering a fun and engaging viewing experience. The special presentation is a delightful continuation of the characters' stories, making them more relatable and adding an extra layer of excitement to the Marvel universe.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"The last fifteen minutes or so do redeem this to a certain extent, but otherwise it is a curiously disjointed story that seems drawn from ""Island at the Top of the World"" (1974) with bits of ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"" (1959) and ""The Lost World"" (1960) thrown in for good measure. We start with the legendary explorer ""Jaeger Clade"" who is determined to find a way past the enclosing mountain peaks of their community. Like many a father, he drags along his unwilling son and when things come to an head, he proceeds alone leaving the younger man ""Searcher"" with his newly discovered crop of radioactive Brussels sprouts. Twenty-five years pass, and he has now grown up and successfully developed a farm of these particularly useful vegetables. He even has his own statue! Suddenly, though, the plants start to die and it falls to him and his own young son ""Ethan"" to embark on a perilous mission to the heart of the plant's root system and save it before it dies. These escapades are nicely and creatively animated with some fun to be had along the way, but there is simply too much sentiment, familial discord and cheesy dialogue to sustain this - as well as a dog that really annoys after a while. The characterisations are really undercooked and just about every box you can imagine is ticked as the story ultimately concludes with a bit of a nod to Oriental mythology. It is certainly watchable, but there is no need to shell out on a cinema ticket for it.

Nathan,7.0,"Strange World had the potential to be another Disney classic, but unfortunately, some problems limited my total enjoyment.

From the get-go, I need to mention that the animation is breathtaking, and is probably the best Disney has done so far. The animators got to flex their muscles with the fantastic worlds and interesting creatures. It is so flush with color and energy; it was extremely pleasant on the eyes from start to finish.

The overarching story was fun, and I enjoyed the premise of discovering a technology that is simultaneously progressing your civilization while also destroying it. It has a great message of preserving the world, even though it is extremely heavy-handed at times. The action was great, the exploration was mesmerizing, and the diversity of the world was superb. At a macro level, this movie worked for me in almost every way.

The main issues I had with this film were the characters. Individually they are all interesting and unique, even though some of them are major caricatures. But the connections between them are all over the place. A lot of the motivations the characters have are inorganic and feel forced to push the narrative of parent vs child throughout generations. This left me having very little emotions when the characters clashed in high-tension arguments which limited a lot of the impact of the film.

Although, the blue creature was cute, funny, and perfect! I loved him.
This movie had a lot going on, and it suffers for it. As a kid movie, the plot and themes were all over the place, and it was sometimes confusing for me. Despite that, it is a visual spectacle filled with many laughs and fun adventures.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,-1.0,"For being a Disney movie made today (2022) this is a fairly decent one. Sure, they have crammed in some of the usual woke nonsense but at least there is not really any of the blatant preaching the more extreme of Disney’s woke mob have managed to cram into things the last couple of years.

It of course helps that it is a all new story and new characters so they didn’t wokeify and ruin some of the old classics.

If one ignores the nonsense the story is pretty decent and so are the characters. Nothing to write home about but adequate. The coolest character is of course Jaeger. I quite liked him even though he sometimes was a bit dimwitted in his single mindedness. Searcher and his son Ethan are more bland and boring with one just wanting to be a farmer and the other one being the obligatory woke element in this movie.

What really makes the movie rise slightly above being bland is the absolutely magnificent scenery. It is a strange world indeed. It is strange, weird, scary and beautiful all at the same time. This creature, Splat, that Ethan eventually befriends was a nice comical element.

It is a shame though that they couldn’t create a better ending. I mean given what this strange world actually is surely there would be plenty of other options for harvesting energy instead of just more or less giving up. If the writers wanted to deliver some rubbish green message they failed miserably.

Anyway, a decent enough movie. I did enjoy watching it.",2023-01-09T09:38:36.597Z,877269,3 stars,0.5434436798095703

I knew nothing about <em>'Strange World'</em> pre-watch, having only very briefly seen the poster(s) a few times online. The quick look I had at the character design from said poster(s) and the fact that I hadn't heard this talked about anywhere meant my expectactions were quite low.

Happily, however, what I saw across the 102 minute run time pleased me. I do think the characters and voice cast could've been improved, but both of those departments are still good. I wasn't immediately keen on the animation style, though honestly I very quickly warmed to it; the world comes alive nicely. The story kept me interested from beginning to end, all that is portrayed is enjoyable.

It obviously could've been greater, yet I still had fun with this. I felt way too much sorrow for Splat in that burn scene btw, it's always impressive how they can make you care for such side characters.

Jack,-1.0,"While the first **Knives Out** is undoubtedly more eerie and traditional when viewed alongside other murder mysteries, the modernity (both politically, and just through the characters and humour) is what makes this so dynamic, and so, so, great.

Despite the already immense cast in the first production, this time around it still manages to feel so much grander. When actors like Ethan Hawke, Natasha Lyonne and Hugh Grant make mere cameos throughout, it just puts even more excitement into an already electrifying crowd. And each member of that crowd is amazing. The highlighting performances unsurprisingly include Daniel Craig, but Janelle Monet very well might take the cake. She completely surprised me and ended up bringing more to the film than anyone else, way more exuberant than I have ever seen her. Additionally, Kate Hudson and Dave Bautista were both so much fun, Norton was hilarious, and despite not having the largest role Madelyn Cline was really excellent too. The only two that I can't say I was the biggest fan of were Leslie Odom Jr. and Kathryn Hahn. Neither were exceptionally bad or anything, rather just a bit boring with the fact that they were two pretty large roles and not a lot of energy came from either of them.

Even though the cast is the main attraction, the editing is also fantastic. Great use of split screens, timeline jumps, and just overall creativity too. 

All in all, it's one of the most entertaining mysteries in a while, and a new highlight of the year for sure. I am not usually fond of franchises but when Johnson announced during the Q&A that he had the intention on making countless more of these I became quite excited.

Nathan,8.0,"_Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery_ is a lighthearted murder mystery filled with effective comedy, fantastic performances, and a somewhat predictable plot.

Overall, I had a great time with this film and the theater experience was one of my favorites of the year. The plot is somewhat similar to the first, a murder happens and Benolt Blanc is there to solve it. It hits all the familiar beats but does not work quite as well as its predecessor, this is mainly due to the characters. The performances were great and they work well in isolation from the overarching story, but all of them are such over-the-top caricatures that are hard to believe their connections or motivations to kill. Their banter with each other is charming and funny and helps carry this movie forward.

The first quarter of this movie was pretty poorly done. A lot of the setup had pandemic references and humor that felt really out of place in 2022. So many movies before this have touched on those topics that it felt overdone and boring. Really interesting choice for this type of film, but once the characters get to the island all of that awkward setup is left on the mainland and the movie starts to find its footing.

From this point forward, I had a great time. Daniel Craig was fantastic as Benolt Blanc and it was quite funny to see him as a fish out of water surrounded by corporate elites. The majority of the lines I laughed at were delivered by him with a dry pan sense of delivery. It was organic and played well on screen. Edward Norton was a fantastic addition and the majority of the cast did excellently. They were really funny and delivered the stereotyped character performances well.

Much like the beginning of the movie, the last ten minutes did not work tremendously well for me. It was quite corny, over the top, and unrealistic. It diminishes the greatness of the middle of the film.

Even though this movie fails to reach the heights of the original, it does enough to deliver a very entertaining mystery that I thoroughly enjoyed. It is a shame that Netflix is only having a limited release for this film because it is best in a crowded theater on the silver screen.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Daniel Craig rather engagingly reprises his role as the ""Poirot""-esque ""Benoit Blanc"" in this fairly unashamed rip-off of all things Agatha Christie. He finds himself an unexpected guest of billionaire ""Bron"" (Edward Norton) on his beautiful Greek island, amongst a slew of other notables who - of course - each have an axe to grind with this outwardly affable host. The purpose of the get-together is a traditional murder mystery, and after an hearty dinner, it will fall on the other guests to discover who has murdered ""Bron"". Well, that's the plan anyway - but of course it doesn't take long for all of that to be derailed and for us to become embroiled in lots of concentric plots and tales of betrayal and duplicity that will truly test the mettle of our sleuth and the audience. The assembled cast provide for a myriad of characterisations and as we discover, an equally fertile source for suspicion and comedy. Kate Hudson is good fun as the nice-but-dim ""Birdie""; Dave Bautista keeps more than you'd think is his budgie-smugglers and Jackie Hoffman steals the show in the very few scenes she graces as his non-nonsense mother. The writing delivers a multi-layered feast - some of it basic and bawdy, some more sophisticated as the story gradually progresses towards a conclusion that navigates the red herrings before a denouement that wasn't quite what I was expecting. It looks really good, and it takes a swing at just about everything from corporate greed, vanity, vacuousness and stupidity - but it does it in a satisfyingly subtle fashion.

Glass Onion is a fun follow-up to Knives Out that captures all the character and energy of its predecessor. While I enjoyed the original more, Glass Onion was still very entertaining. The powerhouse cast ensured that every character exploded to life through the excellent portrayals of Glass Onion's brilliantly chosen stars. Each role felt tailor-made to the actor cast for it. The group of entitled celebrities felt more wild and uncontrollable than the frustrated family of Knives Out, which raised Glass Onion's peril and unpredictability. Glass Onion brilliantly hid clues throughout the film that reveal the murderer if the audience is paying attention. It's a great whodunit, but I would like more development of Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc.

Exceptional performances from a shockingly talented cast - Daniel Craig and Janelle Monáe are the standouts - elevate a screenplay slightly lacking in character depth as well as better control over its clear yet repetitive message concerning opportunism, vanity, and hypocrisy.

My first film of 2023, which has started with a bang! I adore the original film from 2019 so was expecting big things from this sequel and I'm glad to note that it didn't disappoint - it's a cracker. I did, admittedly, predict the general gist of what was going to happen, though (in this case, minor) predictability doesn't always equel badness - like here, I was thoroughly entertained no matter what.

The cast from the first film are better, though those that star in this 2022 release are excellent. Daniel Craig is, of course, superb as Benoit Blanc once again, every single moment with him is terrific. Janelle Monáe also gives a fantastic performance, I predominantly know of her from music but with this, and <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/hidden-figures/"">Hidden Figures</a>'</em>, she can certainly act too.

Kate Hudson, Dave Bautista and Edward Norton are the best of the others, though even the likes of Kathryn Hahn, Leslie Odom Jr. and Madelyn Cline are good value as well. Like its predecessor, it's very astutely cast.

The film is put together in high quality fashion, Rian Johnson & Co. did a great job - particularly with the framing of certain shots, as well as the music which is real neat. As you'd expect for a film of this sort, there are some nice little details spread across the well utilised run time.

Peter McGinn,8.0,"As with the first Knives Out movie, I found the plot to be clever and intricate and the story very well told. There were a few interesting plot twists and, even though the dialogue could have been more witty, it was intelligent and realistic.

I did find that the Renoir character reminded me of an Agatha Christie character, in that he reeled off suppositions he’d made based on information we hadn’t been given full access to. Also, he owed some of his success to a character who he asked to take a snoop around, and she proceeded to be in several spots just in time to hear critical details. Pretty lucky. Then again. I write novels in my spare time and the subtitle of one of them is “The Consequences of Coincidences.” And it features a few of them, so I guess I shouldn’t begrudge a few juicy coincidences in someone else’s work.

And you are told almost from the start who the killer is and what his motivation is..

... so you don't have the tedious guess work there either.

But to keep you on your toes scenes are conveniently rewritten several ways to make it seem like a mystery even though the mystery aspect has been conveniently taken out for today's low IQ audiences.

The viewer conveniently doesn't have to uncover anything, nor try to determine any motivation, and all the clues are obvious and handed to you by virtue of Bond stumbling onto them in a way that leaves the viewer in no doubt despite already knowing who the killer is and what his motivation was.

But it's Johnson so people can pretend to be intelligent by claiming that he diverted expectations of a murder mystery by taking all the thought and mystery out of it and leaving you with the obvious that has been obviously stated for today's modern audience.

Ahmetaslan27,4.0,"**A childish scenario that prevented me from participating in determining who the killer was?**

The first part was dazzling and surprising for those who watched the movie and the fans of movie type of: Who is the killer? The first part presented a group of well-known stars in a different format than the roles they played in previous acting works.

In the second part, I face many challenges: Will the second part be better than the first part, or at least equal to it? Secondly, yes it presents us with a group of stars with beautiful charisma on the screen.

This time, the events of the film take place during the pandemic. This time, the main investigator, the hero of the story, is facing deadly boredom due to him staying at home all the time due to the pandemic and the lockdown. This is what drives him, without hesitation, to participate in one of the games organized by a rich person. This game is to solve a crime, hypothetically a crime that didn't happen in reality. This invitation reaches the investigator and some close friends of this rich person, but during their arrival to the place of the invitation, we begin to discover many mysterious things.

The first is how the friends get to know each other. Each character is completely different from the other character, a rich person, a YouTuber model, a scientist, in addition to a political figure and an investigator. We begin to discover, by starting the conversation from the beginning, that there is a suspicious or unhealthy past for each character, but the most important thing is that it is far from the game and the hypothetical investigation. We begin to discover real crimes in the place of Al-Daghwa, and now everyone is a suspect, and through the story we will learn who the culprit is.

Yes, I am almost certain that the characters of the second part will continue on the same path as the movie of the first part. What I did not like about this movie. Yes, they showed us the motives and reasons, but I could not get behind any motive in them, and in these types of stories, the most beautiful thing is that it shows that you made a mistake about who the murderer is, not Only in deceiving you, but showing you that your deductions were wrong, makes you doubt one or two or three people, and in the end you discover that all your doubts were wrong. In this part, I was not able to doubt anyone.

Yes, it is true, there are many good plots in the scenario, and there is good manipulation, but I cannot be certain that I doubt any character, as if I was waiting and seeing the events for the vision to appear. I could not participate in the game, which is very important in this type of movie. In addition to clarifying things, there were many coincidences to the point of being so ridiculous. The only reason some mysteries and some indicators were discovered is that the character, for some reason, was present at the right time and the right place without any actual intelligence to find the information.

I don't know. I feel that my feelings were confused towards the end of the movie. I would almost describe it as childish ending. the actions of some characters led to the flattening of this movie. The first part was so amazing that it cannot be described.",2023-09-27T21:13:17.297Z,661374,3 stars,0.385005384683609

It may not have the energetic, intense action of ""that other planes flick"", but it doesn't need to either, as the film's engine is found in the in-depth arcs of each character. Jonathan Majors and Glen Powell are phenomenal, bringing tremendous authenticity to their roles and interactions.

Nathan,8.0,"It is a shame that Devotion was somewhat overshadowed with another somewhat popular aviator movie this year... but, it separates itself with a more grounded and dramatic approach.

Devotion follows the first Black aviator, Jessie Brown, (Jonathan Majors) and his friendship with fellow pilot Tom Hudner, (Glen Powell). At first, the two are at odds with each other, trying to gauge what type of man they were. Overtime the two grow an incredible bond that is extremely genuine as they persevere the struggles of the war and the constant racism Brown endures.

The main relationship of this movie worked incredibly well, the chemistry between Majors and Powell was infectious. Hudner displays a genuine desire to be a good person and stand up for Brown, but his naiveness gets in his way as he does not see his actions are causing more harm than good. This film does a great job of portraying the nuances of racism, some old and some that still are relevant today. It did so very soft handed and as a backdrop of the film, which worked well in delivering the main narrative of this emotional story.

I would have to argue that the action in this film is almost better than Top Gun: Maverick. Almost every action scene is in combat with enemy fighters and anti-air tanks, as opposed to training sessions and montages. This creates a much more tense experience as at any second our main characters could get shot down or killed. The high stakes mixed with great cinematography created a very riveting action experience.

Overall, I had a really great time with this film. It is great balance of action and drama with an ending that brought tears to my eye.

He is Tom Hudner, whom together with Jesse Brown (Jonathan Majors) became joined at the hip as the latter became the former pilot's wingman. They both joined the US Navy at around the same time and their bond is little short of brotherhood as they undergo combat training and then combat itself together. It's on one such mission that that friendship is tested to the extreme... This is a well produced and good looking film that illustrates well the extent of loyalties and inter-dependencies of these men on each other and on their equipment. It also demonstrates the dangers of warfare, even for those flying at great speed several hundred feet up in the air, and it does both quite well. The acting, though, is a little dry with there actually being little chemistry between the two men here. The writing is adequate and there is plenty of airborne photography to bring it alive, but somehow that sense of brotherhood is just lacking. History tells us that this is true, and like so many wartime stories serves to illustrate that racism has no place in anyone's heart. It is way less gung-ho and ye-ha than many of this genre which is good - I just wish they had cast it a bit more strongly.",2023-02-13T08:21:16.916Z,653851,4 stars,0.6085836291313171

Nathan,10.0,"_Bones and All_ is one of the most unique movies I have ever seen. It somehow simultaneously disgusts me while filling me with intense emotion capable of drawing tears to my eyes. It is a perfect blend, that I was unaware that I needed.

The journey our characters take in immense in terms of emotion and distance. I had such a great time watching our leads travel across country going wherever their hearts desired or wherever their noses took them. There were some creepy and intense encounters that had me on the edge of my seat but that was balanced with intimate moments between our leads. These scenes fill the majority of the 2 hour and twenty-minute runtime, and while that is a decently long film, it flew by, and the pace never seemed to lull. There were some scenes that could have been cut to save some time, but I argue that they were essential for character development and to make the film whole.

Throughout the course of the runtime there are intense introspective themes of morality that are at constant play. Watching the characters balance desire and need was so heartbreaking and real. Despite the horrific acts our main characters are performing, there is a deep hidden shame that seeps out as our character learns more and more about what she is.

These are very complex emotions to handle on screen and our two leads absolutely nailed it. Both Taylor Russell and Timothée Chalamet were brilliant! I will be honest, Timothée Chalamet is one of the big reasons why I wanted to see this movie so much and while he did an excellent job, he was outshined by Taylor Russell. She was so excellent, honestly perfect! This is the first film I have seen her in, and I was blown away. She deserves all the award recognitions for this film.

Bones and All is a masterpiece and needs to be seen in theaters. This is a hard movie to sell to an audience, but it was done perfectly and deserves all the credit, awards, and viewership.

Forced to flee with her father, who subsequently abandons her, she decides to try to track down her mother. A few bus journies later, she encounters the enigmatic ""Sully"" (Sir Mark Rylance) with whom she shares a snack and from whom she discovers a little more about her nature.

He also has the same nourishment predilections and so the two start to bond. He helps her with her familial quest before an unexpected visitor throws quite a spanner in their plan. At times this is little better than a derivative road movie. The characterisations are all just a bit too contrived, and the narrative is hardly original - but, that said, there is a quirkily spooky performance from Sir Mark - who looks like he would not be out of place half way up an Alp and Russell offers a reasonable effort as the conflicted and confused young woman trying to reconcile her innate desires with her aspirations as a woman. Chalamet presents us with one of his more natural and charismatic performances here, even if - shirtless for much of it as he is - he still makes me want to force feed him a bowl of fries (indeed the title could have been applied just to him!) Lots of dialogue, too much really, but the story has layers of complexity to it surrounding issues of identity and purpose - especially amongst the American young, some fine photography and it plays the accruing sense of affection between the youngsters without cringing sentimentality before an ending that seemed a little unnecessarily brutal.

I'd totally recommend <em>'Bones and All'</em>. I found plenty of enjoyment across the just over 2hr run time, despite plenty of unsettling moments scattered in there. I personally found the first half stronger than what follows it, though all in all it's a movie I had a positive time with.

Taylor Russell and Timothée Chalamet, two actors who give impressive showings in this 2022 production. Russell kinda outshines Chalamet in parts, but the latter does come up trumps with some strong emotion near the end. One thing's certain though: Mark Rylance is the star of the show, for my money at least. What a performance, loved every second of him being onscreen. Simply the perfect actor for the role of Sully!

Of course, these transgressions aren't allowed and they are both pursued by the relentless and cunning ""Agent Green"" (Weruche Opia) from the Bureau charged with preventing such activities, as well as by the nightmares of the young girl which threaten to consume all in their path. To be fair, Momoa does enter into the spirit of the story, but his characterisation is just too hammy and over-cooked. I kept wondering if Antonio Banderas might have been better, or Geoffrey Rush? Barkley is enthusiastic and quite engaging, though, and the visual effects are creative, imaginative and vividly expressed as we progress. The nature of the narrative is a bit repetitive, which doesn't always help, and the story is the simplest of fairy tales-style efforts that does have a certain charm to it - especially her stuffed pig - but is really rather too thin to pad out an overlong two hours of screen time.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,8.0,"I was happy to watch this movie yesterday. I did not really know about but it the kids suggested it for our evening movie session. After watching that woke rubbish Free Guy, this was quite refreshing.

But most important, free of woke bullshit, political preaching and agenda pushing. Of course that rubbish site Rotten Tomatoes’ critics gave it a 40% rotten while the audience gave it a 85% fresh rating which, to me, made the movie even more enjoyable.

It is a nice adventure jumping between the real world and the dream world. The real world was sometimes a wee bit gloomy and boring but the dream world made up for that.

My expectations for this film were low, as it was not only a sequel but also one without even a theatrical release. And the first 20 minutes or so was about on par with your typical ""sitcom sequel"": Family moves out of the big city into the suburbs, angsty teen just wants to go home, mother who doesn't understand teenagers proceeds to embarrass her on her first day, etc etc.... Needless to say, I was settled in for a mediocre film.

I was, however, surprised by several things once the magical part of the film got rolling. While character development is thin in this film, a certain twist involving Giselle caught me off guard and there are several clever foreshadowing points and Disney callbacks throughout the film. Musical numbers range from OK to Good, but there's a particular jazzy duet that knocked my socks off. (If you've seen the movie, you know exactly which one I'm talking about.) 

Unfortunately, the novelty wears off around the third act of the film, where it essentially just becomes your basic fairy-tale kids movie plot. Save the world before midnight, showdown with main villain, yada yada.. Anyway, the movie brings a few good ideas to the table, and it's probably worth a watch - it's not like you gotta pay for movie tickets after all.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Try as I did, I just couldn't really engage with this rather long, procedural and sterile depiction of two journalist's traumatic and courageous efforts that finally ended Harvey Weinstein's unfettered abuse of many of the women who worked for and with him over the lengthy span of his Hollywood dominance. Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan are competent, but no more, as these lead reporters facing the seemingly impossible task of navigating a toxic environment of fear, shame and non-disclosure agreements in the hope that one of his victims will go on the record. When you know what ultimately happens with a true-life scenario, it makes the telling of the story that much harder because there is no sense of jeopardy. The thing with this for me, though, was that the writing and characterisations were all just too flat. It also frequently blurs the distinctions between fact (or ""information"" as it is often referred to here) with unsubstantiated gossip. Now, clearly the aim of these two ladies was to substantiate those rumours, but the film doesn't really get to grips properly with that. One witness has been untraceable for many years (yet she is readily found by them living with her mother!); the others have remained tight lipped due to the NDAs but suddenly start to spill the beans. Why? What made them decide to finally bring this brute to book? The cold-calling nature of their approaches often appears cruel and ill-considered of the consequences (especially the scene with Andrew Cheung (Edward Astor Chin) obliviously mowing his lawn). None of the detail or personalities are really gone into here - the whole style is superficial and the lack of dramatisation of any of the incidents, or - indeed - of Weinstein himself, leaves us with a slightly disjointed, hollow, movie. It looks at the abhorrences of intimidation and oppression in the workplace then makes generic inferences that - and this applies to men, gay people, people of colour and not just women - rather underwhelmed me at the end. As a chronology of an investigative report it is fine. As a drama about real people facing real horrors it just lacks for depth and character.",2022-11-26T08:13:29.810Z,837881,3 stars,0.4392586648464203
Peter McGinn,9.0,"I tend to like movies with less action and more introspection and more “talkative.” Still, since I had read the book on this and saw other reports, I wondered if this might all seem like old news when I watched it. But I found out to be enthralling. I engaged with the lead characters and appreciated the excellent work of the secondary characters. For example, a quiet but strong portrayal of the partner of one of the reporters who seemed to be a reporter in his own right but who was supportive of her efforts.

I felt they didn’t go for the melodramatic approach here as they well might have. They merely hinted about moments like one of them wondering if a car occupant was watching her, and used just one threatening phone call when they probably actually had many of them. It kept the story cleaner and moving forward.

She Said reminded me of All the Presidents Men, with the two investigative reporters being held to a standard of having sufficient sources to back up their reporting but where Woodward and Bernstein seemed mostly concerned with holding people accountable for their illegal actions, the journalists in she Said connected and formed a personal bond with the victims they located and encouraged to speak out.",2023-01-02T20:32:51.115Z,837881,3 stars,0.4510970115661621
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,4.0,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

Important subject matter doesn’t always translate to a good movie, and “She Said” is a botched attempt at retelling the true story of two New York Times reporters who took down the infamous Hollywood abuser, Harvey Weinstein. It’s something with which the industry is very familiar, and the years of sexual misconduct that the two women uncovered is horrifying. It was one of the most important articles to ever run in the newspaper, but this story would be better suited to the page and not the screen.

The film follows writers Megan Twohey (Carey Mulligan) and Jodi Kantor (Zoe Kazan) as they investigate the Miramax movie mogul, trying repeatedly to get big name actresses to go on the record to expose Weinstein’s gross abuse of power. Instead of offering new insight, director Maria Schrader uses the same old newsroom clichés to create a pedestrian investigative journalism film. It’s procedural, boring, and repetitive, with a series of scenes featuring the two leads making phone calls, writing or reading text messages, and sitting in editorial meetings. Of course, this is less than interesting because the story isn’t cinematic: it’s dull.

The film touches on the more interesting aspects of working as a woman in Hollywood, as many of Weinstein’s victims refused to be named on the record because they were terrified they’d never work again. This did happen more often than not, and he either bought or forced their silence. Perhaps if screenwriter Rebecca Lenkiewicz had decided to focus more on the personal dilemmas and fallout his victims faced rather than only briefly touch on them, this would have been a stronger and more powerful movie.

Even worse, the film doesn’t feel timely. The decision to tell this story now seems dated and past its expiration date. Women will always remember the #MeToo movement and it will go down in history as one of the most important feminist campaigns of the 2000s, but many of us would rather forget about Weinstein while he rots away in jail.

Here’s where my biggest problem with the film comes in: the story leaves a really bad taste in my mouth, especially when you stop to realize that many of Weinstein’s employees, friends, and peers either aided in covering up his crimes or even worse, willfully looked the other way. Harvey’s touchy nature and treatment of subordinates was the worst kept secret in Hollywood circles. He was as creep, and many who met him were uncomfortable being in his presence. It feels a bit disingenuous (or perhaps just a bit ironic) to make a movie about it, even if the story’s focus is on the two reporters.

The better parts of the narrative inspire with the proof of the power of journalism to encourage change, and Kantor and Twohey absolutely played a huge part in giving women who were victimized the courage to come forward. Mulligan gives a strong performance, but it’s a shame she didn’t have an equally robust script to work with. Both of the leads feel wasted, especially when they are called on to do little more than rattle off facts and name-drop big actresses who came forward to expose the year of abusive behavior by Weinstein. None of this is a substitute for compelling drama, and “She Said” fades into the void of forgettable procedural journalism films.",2023-04-23T06:27:40.469Z,837881,2 stars,0.5464804768562317

""The Menu is one of the biggest personal disappointments of the year.

Mark Mylod's film boasts inspired performances by the entire cast - Ralph Fiennes and Nicholas Hoult stand out - and some clever satirical moments, but pretty much nothing else works. Humor falls completely flat - except for the sequences à la Masterchef Australia. Screenplay follows surprisingly generic paths, being a mystery without any minimally impactful shock. Characters lack depth, and the anti-elite message is too evident and insignificant.

It should still get an overall positive reception.""

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Arch-foodie ""Tyler"" (Nicholas Hoult) and his girlfriend ""Margot"" (Anya Taylor-Joy) are off to dine in a restaurant without parallel. Based on an island of just twelve acres, they join a collection of wealthy and influential people for what has been defined as experience to die for! Upon arrival, we discover that ""Margot"" was not the originally intended guest of her companion - so first question... Who is she? Next question - why does it seem to matter so much to the fastidious and frankly rather menacing chef ""Slowik"" (Ralph Fiennes) and his assistant ""Elsa"" (Hong Chau) who looks like she used ""Rosa Klebb"" as a role model? As the dinner progresses it becomes quite clear that the menu is not just about the exquisitely prepared and presented food, but is also about an appraisal of the individually selected - and none too savoury - staff and clientele, none of who are quite what they seem! This has something of Agatha Christie's ""Ten Little Indians"" to it, and it quite effectively pokes fun at the supercilious and frequently rather pompous attitude of both those cooking and those eating (or experiencing) fine foam dining. That humour is dark and potent, too. Fiennes is entirely convincing and Hoult, as well as Janet McTeer as the self-important food critic ""Lillian"" and Paul Adelstein as her suitably obsequious companion ""Ted"" contribute well as the sense of the ridiculous evolves into one considerably more perilous. It could have evolved just a bit more quickly for me - there are certainly enough ""get on with it"" moments and though ATJ's character is feisty, it doesn't quite work and ultimately served to illustrate the increasing implausibility of the story and unlikely servility of the diners as we head towards an almost Vernean denouement. It is quirkily entertaining this - a well presented, multi-layered, attack on our own senses that is better second time around. Not perfect, but I suspect Michelin would love it.",2022-11-21T09:23:09.435Z,593643,4 stars,0.43827271461486816
The Movie Mob,5.0,"**The Menu began with a tone and tension that made me want more but ultimately ended with confusion and disappointment.**

The hype for The Menu intrigued me. The reviews celebrated its genius. So I had to see it. And when I sat in the theater and the credits began to roll, all o could say was, ""Huh?"" The Menu starts with Ready or Not vibes with a fish-out-of-water real-world character who ends up at a fancy dinner with a collection of high society foodies and critics. The trailer gave me expectations of cannibalism cult or Most Dangerous Game-type plots, but instead, nothing really happened. I think I understood what The Menu was trying to convey with its deeper meaning, but I still came up disappointed. Anya Taylor-Joy and the rest of the cast gave great performances, but there was little that really brought the movie together. Maybe the subversion of the cannibal or hunting expectation was the movie's brilliance? The Menu definitely tried to be clever, but whether it was or not might be open to interpretation. Ironically, I sat through the whole movie and left wanting more… left hungry.",2022-11-22T15:01:01.477Z,593643,2 stars,0.5820736885070801
Nathan,9.0,"_The Menu_ was one of the most unique thriller experiences of the year! The setup is fantastic, and the story gives you just enough information to intrigue even though the story path is somewhat generic. It is dark, honest, and quite hilarious. This unique blend created a thriller like no other.

The performances were great. Anya Taylor-Joy was brilliant and is cementing herself as one of the best actresses of the decade. Nicholas Hoult was hilarious in such a subtle way that never takes away from the tense scenes at play. Ralph Fiennes is haunting but also sympathetic, making him a very interesting and genuine antagonist.

This was such an amazing film and another smash entry into horror palooza that is 2022.

Nate Richardson,9.0,"> **Jim Jones; Executive Chef**

Going to a once-in-a-lifetime tasting at a restaurant headed by one of (if not _the_) most renowned chefs in the world sounds like a dream come true to any foodie. (Myself included, albeit vicariously via the Food Network) Two of these lucky guests are Tyler (played by **Nicholas Hoult**), and Margot (played by **Anya Taylor-Joy**).

The issue is, something is already not right.  No, it's not obvious; at least not to normal people like you and me. Elsa (played by **Hong Chau**) picked up on it, but she isn't like us.  As more and more guest arrive, someone isn't supposed to be there... Ah, don't worry, the feeling will pass.  After all, the tasting is just about to start...

This is when we meet the executive chef, Chef Slowik (brilliantly played by **Ralph Fiennes**).  At first he is charismatic and prepares his guest for each tasting with stories. But this little cult like bigrade eventually let on that they know more about their guests than anyone should... That is except for one. 

As someone who is enamored with the food world, seeing The Menu satire some of my favorite shows:

* Netflix's Chef's Table with the course spotlight cinematography and ingredients cards.
* Any Celebrity Chef (i.e. Chef Slowik calling someone a 'donkey', clearly a reference to Gordon Ramsey).  

...I was delighted that this film leaned into the dark end of how service work can feel sometimes.  This film feels cathartic having lived the life of a service worker, and I feel others who have had that experience should be able to connect to the darker parts of the film as well. 

The plot culminate in a theme that I think despite what mild morbidity was displayed, most watchers can relate; Be it society's expectations or our own, the more we push toward perceived greatness we run away from that childhood excitement that set up on the path to begin with. 

The Menu as a whole, is, well... Something you might hear at an actual tasting: A story of life, it's memories (good and bad) told in 5 courses.  If you're part of the menu, you deserve to stay until the end... That is, unless your not supposed to be here; perhaps life hasn't beaten you down enough yet... In-any-case, there is always the _cool aid_.",2023-01-09T21:44:47.621Z,593643,3 stars,0.42179304361343384
MovieGuys,7.0,"The Menu is a film defined by one key ingredient, the performance of Ralph Fiennes. His cold, biting acerbic chef, whose every word and nuance expresses a certain irony and a gradually building threat, is compelling. 

Frankly, it was Fiennes lynch pin performance that kept me watching The Menu. Had it been a less actor, I might well have walked away. Which brings me to the script. A predictable idea, with a certain promise that's far too loosely executed. The result is a plot that has more than a few dead ends and lacks a certain consistency and credulity. Its not awful, not at all. That said, with a more consideration and tightening of plot elements, it could have been so much more. 

In summary, if The Menu is remembered for anything, to my mind, it will be the remarkable performance handed in by Ralph Fiennes. The bulk of my 7/10 rating is based on his remarkable work. Regrettably, in most other respects, this film is somewhat forgettable, horror fare.",2023-01-12T22:33:11.592Z,593643,3 stars,0.40391805768013

tensharpe,8.0,"“The Menu” takes anti capitalism and serves it up with a sprinkle or two of violence delivered on a plate by a perfectionist, cult leading chef. Mark Mylod produces a horror comedy that takes shots at culinary snobbery as well as performance art. 

Margot ( Anya Taylor-Joy ) and her supposed boyfriend Tyler (Nicholas Hoult ) take a boat, along with a number of other diners, to a remote Restaurant called Hawthorn situated on a private Island. The restaurant’s avant garde head chef ( Ralph Fines ) sells both art and home grown, self produced food to a select group of high earning customers with quality and presentation far above any other culinary experience. As the guests arrive they are first subjected to a tour of the Island to see the produce used in Hawthorn being grown and sea food being gathered. Once seated in the restaurant the food begins to be served along with a story from head chef outlining the dish and its significance to the overall experience.  Before the final course is served the stories become darker and more extreme culminating in the diners becoming fearful for their own lives.  

Before we reach the final course one sous chef announces that the menu requires “ an ending that ties everything together conceptually”. At this point in the proceedings it becomes clear that the restaurant staff are very much following the direction of their head chef without question, much in the way followers of any cult leader react.  “The Menu” is very unsettling and produces some uneasy, grimacing moments but balances them out well with enough humour and satire to make for a rather enjoyable experience.",2023-01-26T08:32:48.871Z,593643,4 stars,0.6148553490638733
Aaaidan,3.0,"This movie is not nearly as clever as it thinks it is. Without giving anything away, the plot is a unique one and the main villain's motivation is original, but the movie spoils everything by treating the audience like idiots.

One example (and this _is_ a spoiler, albeit a small one, so skip this paragraph if you still want to watch the movie) is when one character gets his finger chopped off. This was because he told his wife he was going to 'handle' the situation, and one of the baddies responded by asking 'with which hand?' When he didn't reply, she said 'left hand, ring finger' and one of the other baddies proceeded to chop said finger off.

Now that all sounds very clever (handle/hand - what a pun!) if you don't think about it too much, but if you _do_, you'll realize that the baddies had no way of knowing that that character was going to use the word 'handle', and yet removing his finger seemed to have been pre-planned. Were they going to do it anyway, and his use of the word was a lucky coincidence that allowed them to make a pun while doing it? Or in their meeting earlier, did they say ""at some point someone might use the word 'handle', at which point we're going to remove part of their hand""? I don't know, and some of you might say I'm being pedantic, but this movie was _full_ of things like this. It really took me out of it. 3/10, wouldn't recommend.",2023-04-12T09:41:27.473Z,593643,3 stars,0.4689938724040985
r96sk,8.0,"Late to the party with this one! Probably a party to avoid anyway...

<em>'The Menu'</em> is a film deserving of hype. It's very good, with some strong storytelling and excellent cast showings. Anya Taylor-Joy continues to be a very reliable actress, yet to dislike a performance from her. Ralph Fiennes, meanwhile, feels perfect for the role of Chef.

Hong Chau sticks out too, while it was good to see Paul Adelstein act again - not seen him in anything since <em>'Prison Break'</em>, well aside from a bit part in his (underrated) <em>'Imposters'</em> show. The movie sets an nice tone, it isn't all that unpredictable (though is in a few moments, tbf) but still manages to build good tension throughout.

As someone who hadn't seen either but has now at least seen one of them, up until recently I thought this and <em>'The Bear'</em> were the same thing; based on a few glimpses I got of each poster. How interesting that they released so close to each other, even the (great) <em>'Boiling Point'</em> feature film with Stephen Graham basically came out in 2022 too.

RalphRahal,7.0,"The Menu is a sharp, darkly satirical thriller that blends psychological tension with biting humor. The story follows a group of privileged diners who visit an exclusive restaurant on a secluded island, only to find that the experience is far more intense than they anticipated. The plot is well-paced, keeping the mystery alive while gradually increasing the unease. It balances its social commentary with an engaging, almost theatrical structure that makes every course feel like a performance in itself.

The direction by Mark Mylod is precise, with every scene meticulously crafted to build tension. He knows exactly when to hold back and when to push the intensity, making the film feel controlled yet unpredictable. The cinematography is stunning, with an almost clinical beauty that enhances the eerie atmosphere. The way the food is presented is almost too perfect, mirroring the precision of the restaurant itself. Every frame feels intentional, elevating the film beyond a simple horror-thriller setup.

The acting is one of the strongest aspects, with Ralph Fiennes delivering a chilling, captivating performance that demands attention. Anya Taylor-Joy is fantastic as always, bringing both vulnerability and resilience to her role, making her one of the most compelling characters on screen. The supporting cast does a great job of embodying different aspects of elitism and entitlement, making the ensemble feel dynamic without any weak links. The script is sharp, filled with clever dialogue that keeps the tension high while delivering dry, dark humor that lands well.

The score adds another layer to the experience, subtly enhancing the unease without overpowering the scenes. It blends well with the sound design, making every little detail, from the clink of silverware to the deliberate movements of the staff, feel heightened. The film does a great job of making you feel like you're sitting at the table, absorbing every moment of the experience. Overall, The Menu is a well-executed, visually striking thriller that knows exactly what it's serving, and it does so with precision and purpose.",2025-02-16T00:52:28.687Z,593643,4 stars,0.5006885528564453
Peter McGinn,6.0,"I saw several negative reviews before I watched this, and I assumed there was an element of grading someone a bit more harshly when they have achieved wild success or, heaven forbid, if they do stellar work in one genre such as sci-fi or adventure and then have the chutzpah to create a film in a different genre not appreciated by the sci-fi etc. fans. Maybe there was some of that baggage involved; how else to explain one-star reviews. Really? A disgusting gross-out comedy might get 4 stars, but a serious biopic gets one?

But I have given it six stars, probably my low for a Spielberg movie. I thought the film was too episodic. Here is where he saw his first movie; here is him with his first camera; here is where he learns something upsetting about his parents’ marriage; here is some bullying and then that part in every coming of age movie it seems, where a pretty girl throws herself at him. Sure wish that had happened to me at that tender age. And some of the scenes felt rather cliched to me. Also, and this is a bit of a spoiler, at one point his mother assures him she has not done ”that” with Bennie, and she loves her children and husband more than anything, but she still can’t live without Bennie? I had trouble with that revelation.

But it isn’t all negative stuff. I thought a lot of the acting was strong, with a few exceptions, and most of the dialogue was good, but when a film is 2 and a half hours long, consistency is hard to come by, and there were a few hiccups here and there. The scene with John Ford was intriguing, but they could have done a bit more with it. I liked the two sisters as characters, but again, not enough depth was given to them.

tensharpe,8.0,"“The Fabelmans” is a movie loosely based on the true story of Steven Spielberg’s own childhood. Produced after the death of his mother Leah Adler and using the fictional family name of the Fabelmans the movie focuses primarily on the iconic film makers family and the impact his parents divorce had on his young life.  “The Fabelmans” is rich in  exposing the influences behind classic movies like E.T. ( Set in a broken home ) and some early techniques at effects the film maker used to better his home movies. 

“The Fabelmans” starts in the 1950’s with Sammy Fabelman experiencing for the first time the magic of cinema with his parents. Slightly traumatised by the movie, particularly a train crash scene, it’s from this emotional experience the first glimpses of becoming a film maker appear. Who of us that have delved into the arts ( film making, actors , singers , performers , etc ) didn’t start off creating these types of home made replicas?  The idyllic family set up, with the ever growing confident and more adept young home movie maker,  becomes derailed when after editing his 8mm footage of a family camping trip he discovers all was not as he remembered.  The impact of what Sam discovers about his concert pianist mother and that fateful trip results in the eventual breakdown of his parents. 

As the movie moves into the early 1960’s and Spielberg’s high school years “The Fabelmans”touches on religion, race issues and first love. Due to the impact of that fateful camping holiday and therefore following a hiatus of not wanting to make any further home movies, Sam is persuaded by his girlfriend to film the end of school year beach party get together.  The impact of Sam’s return to film making is clearly visible after the graduation film he produced is shown at the school prom to great acclaim.  

“The Fabelmans” is well documented as being a love letter to cinema but equally it is Spielberg’s love letter to his family. This is the movies key fact, the acceptance of multiple things happening all at once. Vocation is driven by both fear and talent, loving relationships break down, and movies that appear simplistic are highly sophisticated. With an extremely satisfying ending “ The Fabelmans” is a beautifully crafted work of art and remarkable insight into one of the most famous and influential directors Hollywood has ever produced",2023-02-03T11:55:57.419Z,804095,4 stars,0.7121605277061462
CinemaSerf,7.0,"Gabriel LaBelle is great in this generally entertaining and interesting tale of a young lad (""Sammy"") growing up in post-war America who has a penchant (and eye) for film making. Growing up in an happy environment with mother ""Mitzi"" (Michelle Williams), father ""Burt"" (Paul Dano) and sister ""Natalie"" (Keeley Karsten) they all rub along amiably enough. His father is a developer in the computer industry, and together with their best family friend ""Bennie"" (Seth Rogan) relocate to a better opportunity in Arizona. It's after a family camping trip - and the death of his grandmother - that the young ""Sammy"" is asked to make a short movie from the film he shot whilst they were all messing about in the wilderness. His attention to the detail of his photography gradually reveals something that upsets him, and threatens the very equilibrium of their erstwhile happy family. What now ensues demonstrates how, gradually, all come to terms with his discovery and he determines just where his future career lies. I am not really a fan of Williams - I find her sterile most of the time; but here she is on really good form. The character of ""Mitzi"" is probably the most interesting, certainly the most conflicted - and she delivers it well. There are two lovely little, inspirational in differing ways, cameos from Judd Hirsch and from David Lynch at the end of this film that has a distinct lusciousness to it. Like the performances, the photography and the soundtrack are natural and engaging and could easily convince any of us that a career in film making is possible - indeed, straightforward!

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Despite more experienced and lauded stars, this film only really belongs to the young Australian Zen McGrath in the title role. He is ""Nicholas"", a young man who lives with his divorcee mother (Laura Dern) while his father (Hugh Jackman) has a new family with ""Beth"" (Vanessa Kirby) and baby ""Theo"". His mother reaches the end of her tether when it transpires that the young man has been skipping school. She feels genuinely intimidated by him and so a move to dad's is soon on the cards. Settling in ok? Going to a new school? Well that's when we begin to spot signs that this lad has problems. Signs of self harm ring alarm bells and indicate a spiralling descent for ""Nicholas"" that perhaps only his father can arrest? The story is interesting, but the writing is frankly terrible and the acting from both Jackman and the always limited Dern is truly wooden. For such an emotive subject there is no sense of involvement; no personal touches - he is never to referred to as ""Nick"" or anything that might illustrate that there any intimate love here. It's all just a bit sterile with join-the-dot scenarios that accumulate towards an ending that serves no purpose at all. That's not to say it had to be all rose covered cottages, but the last twenty minutes really defy even the most devoted of parental logic before a rather abrupt denouement. It might offer a beginners guide to warning signs for parents, but otherwise this is a weakly constructed and frankly, rather implausible, drama that really disappoints.",2023-02-24T08:38:20.377Z,806368,2 stars,0.7068678736686707
CinemaSerf,6.0,"Wow, but this is all over the place. Based very loosely on the Dickens' character from his ""A Christmas Carol"" story, Will Ferrell is the Ghost of Christmas Present who now works for ""Jacob Marley"" (Patrick Page) trying to save irredeemable souls from purgatory. This is where Ryan Reynolds comes in. He is ""Clint"" - a successful influencer who is about as ruthless for his clients as it possible to be. ""Present"" concludes that if he can save him, then he can make a real difference to the future (despite the fact that he appears, already, to have rescued Dolly Parton!). Anyway, this is where the story gets a little more interesting. Rather than cowering in fear at his apparitions, ""Clint"" decides to turn the tables a bit and before we know it, he is challenging his protagonist to justify what he is doing and why. Unfortunately, though - and despite the presence of the usually reliable Octavia Spencer - the whole thing just peters out all too quickly with some predictably slapstick humour and a few rather dull piano/guitar ballads from an out-of-sorts Messrs. Pasek and Paul that have some potent lyrics now and again, but those are largely overwhelmed by the fact that Reynolds cannot sing and Ferrell fares only slightly better on that front too. It also has no idea how to end, so it has three or four goes by which time I was a bit bored by it all. It's been quite a while since I noticed people leaving a cinema screening, but quite a few abandoned this. Nothing beats the Albert Finney/Leslie Bricusse ""Scrooge"" (1970) for me, and though this iteration of the timeless story might work better on stage - much of it is very theatrically stylised in nature (especially the dance numbers) - I am just going to stick with that.",2022-11-23T14:33:33.483Z,632856,3 stars,0.5122748017311096

""Spirited efficiently applies a Christmas formula. Harnessing the undeniable, palpable chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Will Ferrell, along with original holiday tunes filled with the typical humor from the actors, Sean Anders delivers a musical entertaining enough to entertain the average spectator.

Not all the songs succeed, nor their timing in the story is always the right one, and the generic narrative doesn't exactly help with the surprise factor. Still, I'm happy enough with the essential message that people can, in fact, change for the better.""

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Set against the rise of Mussolini, this adaptation of the Collodi story draws parallels with the adventures of the eponymous puppet and the fascist's coming to power in Italy. The stop-motion animation is vibrant and simply gorgeous as the old carpenter ""Geppetto"" lives happily with his young son ""Carlo"" until the war intervenes and he is robbed of his very essence. It is whilst in the depths of his despair that he decides to carve a puppet, and imbued with life by a forest sprite - ""Pinocchio"" is born. Curious, mischievous, rebellious - you just know that the youngster is going to be an handful for his father and his friend the cricket. His skills at dancing draw the attention of circus master ""Volpe"" and soon the lad is caught in an intricate trap that causes him and his ""papa"" no end of trauma. This iteration blends the magical and mystical with the political and brutal in a cleverly constructed fashion. The original story of humanity is front and centre, but the failings of, and challenges to, that humanity are also presented to us as we see the best and worst of human nature displayed. It's a love story, and one of the best, and in the hands of a man who knows how to mix the dark and the light - contextually and visually - so well, we are offered an engaging and thought-provoking version of this far darker and interesting fairy tale. A big screen must, if you can - the artistry is intricate and the Desplat score compliments that well, too.",2022-12-03T13:10:49.426Z,555604,4 stars,0.43233469128608704

Chris Sawin,8.0,"Guillermo del Toro has crafted a darker yet equally emotional version of _Pinocchio_. It is exquisitely and intricately animated with rich textures, gorgeous lighting, and mostly welcome character reinventions. The transition to Fascist Italy fits del Toro’s vision well, but the changes remove and alter enjoyable story elements that are surely missed. _Pinocchio_ is absolutely a contender for this year’s best-animated film, but it is a film that I hoped to adore and yet only deeply appreciate.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,7.0,"I didn’t even know that Guillermo del Toro had made an adaptation of Pinocchio until my daughter and oldest son told me they wanted to watch it during our traditional movie evening yesterday. Wow, that was a different take on Pinocchio indeed.

Pinocchio, the original, is not surprisingly, one of the movies I watched as a kid and which is quite dear to me. A movie from the time when the name Disney actually meant something and when they made actual family movies instead of woke crud for the small but loud-mouthed and fanatical minority. Needless to say I have not even contemplated to watch Disney’s latest remake of the original.

But then, Guillermo del Toro movies I often like and, well, the kids (who are also very anti-woke) wanted to watch it so I did not have much choice but to watch it.

I do indeed have some reservations about the theme used in the movie but overall it was a good movie.

The movie is more geared towards adults or at least young adults than Disney’s original. It is much more dark and less humorous. But then, with Guillermo del Toro at the helm that is not really a surprise is it?

Since I did not know anything about this movie until I started to watch it I sat through the entire movie wondering if it was done with stop-motion figures or CGI made to look like stop-motion. It turnes out that it is indeed stop-motion and damned impressive stop-motion at that. Really well done.

The story, which has little to do with the original Disney one to be honest, is not bad but here we come to my main gripe with the movie. I did not really like the setting in fascist Italy with a lot of the movie preaching about fascism. It is really beating a dead horse and it made the movie darker than it had to be. I know Pinocchio is an Italian story so they could not really have set it in communist Russia, even though that would have been much more relevant if they really wanted to have some background bad guys. Still, I just wished they would have found some other theme.

The ending is also nothing like the original Disney movie. It is not entirely a tragic ending but it is certainly not an overly happy one either. It is a good ending but, again, more an adult ending than a children’s story ending.

Overall though, I liked the movie. It was a good movie and an intelligent and technically very well done adaptation of the Pinocchio story.",2022-12-21T10:32:17.691Z,555604,4 stars,0.6664100885391235
r96sk,7.0,"It's good, even if I wouldn't say it's anything better or worse than its Disney animated counterpart - at least it is a marked improvement on that aforementioned company's remake, mind.

The big win of <em>'Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio'</em> is the stop-motion animation, which is extremely nice indeed. As for everything else? Nothing leaps out of my mind if I'm honest, even within 30mins of watching it. I personally found the design of the titular character to be 'just' OK, same goes for Sebastian J. Cricket & Co.

I did like the casting of Ewan McGregor and David Bradley, particularly the latter. Christoph Waltz, meanwhile, is alright in his role. The more serious vibe of the film is a positive, though I don't think it comes across as deep as it intended (e.g. that last line from Cricket isn't, in my opinion, as effective as the film seems to think it is). As for the music: fine but forgettable, for me.

Again, it's passable. I just unfortunately didn't overly care as much as I wanted to for this story and its characters. The 1940 film did it slightly better, fwiw.",2023-01-02T01:05:21.203Z,555604,3 stars,0.5973318815231323

Sure, Guillermo took a much bigger artistic license than Disney. So what? What modern director even attempted to be completely faithful to a book except Peter Jackson?

That said, there quite a few logic holes in Guillermo del Toro's version that took me right out of suspended disbelief. Takes it out of Oscar territory for me, but I don't vote LOL. Aside from that, the artistic effort was superb.",2023-04-10T20:37:51.453Z,555604,4 stars,0.35247406363487244
Crazypiglady,6.0,"More true to the original vibe of the story than the Disney version but the parallels of the Italian fascists could have had more of an impact. The family tragedy did have an impact though which was very moving. The idea of 'Love will give you life' is great but as we all know, isn't true which hindered any inspiration. It would be great if there were good and (fairly) evil spirits (and if there were I'd like mine played by Tilda Swinton please) but there aren't - that shouldn't take away from the story but it doesn't work as a life lesson. The darkness was great but needed more fascism (not a phrase I use that often!) 

I liked the film but it seemed to evade all age groups; too scary for under 12s, too slow for 12 - 15, not gripping enough for 15-18 and not enough parallelling with the rise of fascism or Tilda Swinton for over 40s. Lovely score, lovely stop motion which we don't see enough of nowadays. Lots of potential not quite reached in terms of Ewan McGregor and plot.
Cutting room floor: inside the whale and (unless you're going to do it as a main theme), the fascist element.

The Movie Mob,7.0,"**Wakanda Forever was an earnest film that tackled some tough themes and honored its hero well but got bogged down introducing vast new worlds and complicated characters.**

Wakanda Forever left me with mixed emotions. The respect and love paid to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman were heartfelt, meaningful, and sincere. The movie wisely grappled with the aftermath of T’Challa’s passing on his family and nation. This subject matter created excellent opportunities to dive deeper into characters like Shuri, Nakia, and even M’Baku. Instead, Wakanda Forever primarily served as a vehicle to introduce Namor and Talokan. The film rightfully embraced a more somber tone as it dealt with themes of loss and legacy, but the mournful spirit caused the plot to sag and drag along throughout most of the runtime. Winston Duke offers the little levity the movie had. The cast delivered exceptionally, with Angela Bassett’s performance as the true standout. I liked the movie, but the melancholy approach made it more difficult to really enjoy, and the introduction of Namor and his threat to Wakanda chewed up so much of the story that it was difficult to bring closure to characters struggling with loss and heartbreak satisfyingly.",2022-11-11T05:50:53.964Z,505642,3 stars,0.6036016345024109

""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever may not quite measure up to its predecessor, but it leaves a proud, beautiful, silent tribute to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman, telling an emotionally powerful, resonant story about how grief can truly be love persevering.

The screenplay runs into problems when it deviates from the central theme and tries to mix in other MCU stories/characters, with Namor and Riri suffering collateral damage. Technically, the action set pieces are mostly riveting, despite some inconsistent VFX and lighting. Score and sound production stand out in a remarkably memorable manner.

Brutally passionate, moving performances, especially from Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, and Danai Gurira. Exquisite pacing reduces the weight of the long runtime.

Totally worth the emotional investment.""

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Mourning the unexplained death of King ""T'Challa"", the tech-rich African nation of ""Wakanda"" returns Queen ""Ramonda"" (Angela Bassett) to the throne and she must stabilise the kingdom and try to help her daughter ""Shuri"" (Letitia Wright) deal with the loss of her much-loved brother. A fireside chat late one night doesn't quite go to plan though, when they are introduced to an interloper. ""Namor"" (Tenoch Huerta) arrives to ask their help to thwart the Americans who nave managed to design a machine that can trace vibranium, and this has put his hitherto unknown population of underwater, Mesoamerican, people at risk. Either they help him to track down the scientist who created this or there could be war. The Princess and her general head to Massachusetts where they track down a college student who is almost as much of a whizz-kid as ""Shuri"". The FBI are on soon their trail and skedaddle they must, straight into the arms of the waiting ""Talokan"" who take them to their beautiful watery homeland where we learn just how they evolved. Somewhat narked, the Queen wants her daughter back and that action sows the seeds for a conflict between the two nations that, well, you can guess the rest. Sadly, that's the problem here. Despite a really strong and vibrant performance from Wright and some very fine production values, there is precious little story here. It is far, far, too long to sustain the thin plot and the conflict engineered between the two races is flawed in more ways than an US Congressional election. The pace is really slow, the combat scenes could have been choreographed by Sir Matthew Bourne - or by a Wakandan cheerleader at their equivalent of the ""Superbowl"" - and the supporting characters aren't on screen long enough to give Miss Wright enough help to wade through the frequent tedium. I wasn't helped by Huerta's very thick accent which made his dialogue nigh-on impossible to comprehend at times and the denouement screamed sequel so loudly that I forgot that I'd long given up on any jeopardy at the end two hours ago. There is a bit of character tragedy, character loyalty and thankfully Martin Freeman's (""Ross"" - why does he need an American accent?) appears but sparingly as we go along but Marvel must stop taking the audience for granted. They have to realise that their gorgeous Avatar-esque visual effects and technical wizardry are not going to entertain us indefinitely if the stories continue to deliver so weakly. Great to look at, a few power-ballads from the soundtrack and Wright is certainly a stylish and classy star - otherwise, this is a film nobody will remember in two years time, I'll bet!",2022-11-14T08:25:47.429Z,505642,3 stars,0.4741307199001312
Nathan,7.0,"_Black Panther: Wakanda Forever_ had an impossible task in the wake of the tragic passing of lead Chadwick Boseman, and for the most part Ryan Coggler does a great job at picking up the pieces and creating a heartfelt story.

I feel as though this movie is attempting to do too much though. There are so many side plots and new characters being introduced that the film has a hard time finding its footing. For as much as I enjoyed Riri Williams and here banter with Wakadans, her arch was not necessary. By omitting this character, the story could have been more focused and streamlined creating an easier viewing experience and deflating the runtime.
The writing was decent, but it was pretty exposition heavy. There were countless number of lines that were strictly feeding information to the audience, and they felt inorganic and awkward in the moment. These writing mishaps really hurt my enjoyment and constantly pulled me out of the film.

After those main criticisms, I think this movie overall does a great job in all other departments. The action is surprisingly light, but when it does come it is intense and well-choreographed. There are some really unique fight sequences and weapons introduced with the ""Atlanteans"" that allowed for some really cool scenes and visuals that were done with some stellar CGI. I specifically like how the final battle had some letterboxing that was not present in the rest of the film. It gave it a grand scale that I thought was excellent touch.

The performances were fantastic all around. Angela Bassett was mesmerizing and really captivated me with her emotion and distress with the passing of her son. There is a scene in here that gave me literal goosebumps. Dominique Thorne was a great addition as Iron-Heart and Lupita Nyong'o was amazing in her limited screen time. I loved Winston Duke and desperately wanted more screentime from him. He was sidelined for the majority of the film, and I think that was the wrong decision. Letitia Wright is the real highlight here. She stepped into a very difficult situation and acted her ass off. I never envisioned her as a lead actress, but she proved me wrong.

Something I want to note that I do not normally include in my reviews in the music choice. The score to this movie was crafted brilliantly and really elevate so many scenes. I enjoyed every song and feel as though it blended with the movie brilliantly.
Overall, this movie has its drawbacks but is still an enjoyable watch and one of the better movies in Marvel Phase IV.

r96sk,8.0,"Chadwick Boseman is undeniably missed, but <em>'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever'</em> still manages to produce an entertaining and even touching final chapter of the MCU's Phase Four.

I had a positive time with this, one good thing about watching it almost two months after release is that I got to watch this in an empty cinema - absolute bliss. Thankfully I managed to avoid all spoilers, though had heard the name Namor bandied about online so that's all I knew coming into it.

Speaking of Namor, I'm a fan. He makes for a cool new character to the universe, as does Talokan as a whole, with Tenoch Huerta a welcomed addition to the cast - first time I recall seeing him in something, and I'm impressed. The star of this 2022 flick, however, is Letitia Wright. I don't really remember her standing out in the original much, at least to me, but here Wright is excellent.

Angela Bassett is very good also, there's one emotion-filled speech scene in particular that stands out in my memory. Danai Gurira is always a joy to watch, while Winston Duke and Lupita Nyong'o are the best of the rest - though, the whole cast are good; even Martin Freeman, who I'm not always convinced by.

The film handles Boseman's absence nicely, there are some very touching moments in there. I'd say they went the correct way with the character of T'Challa, no-one would've been able to even closely replicate Boseman. The music, meanwhile, is pleasant.

GenerationofSwine,1.0,"I want to first state that I am absolutely thrilled about how Wokely pro-racism this, I mean it's 2022, the worst year in cinematic history, but I didn't think the Woke corporate overlords would go to this racist extreme.  This is some repugnant crap and if I didn't know better, I would think that they were trying to go full Blazing Saddles and spoof racism.... but alas, it is Disney, and Disney is woke, the racism here isn't satirizing the subject, it's embracing it in all it's evil glory.

Let's start with how they castrated Namor and then move on to utterly and completely they stereotyped Latinos, right down to focusing on how wet his back is and beating him by drying off his wet back.

As if that wasn't racist enough it goes on to make it's prideful support of Black Nationalism clearly stated, the opposite of which we call White Nationalism, which is very much the purview of groups like the Neo-Nazis, KKK, and other hate groups.  Wakanda Forever has done an excellent job of embracing that same ideology for the Black people of the world... and claiming it as a sort of pride.

And that, of course, is exemplified by their virtuous victory over the forces of... Latino, who are so overtly masculine, right down to their shameful gendered language (like about 90% of the other languages on the globe) that they had to edit out Namor's bulge in order to... what... show more African Racial Superiority over the Latino population, or maybe just to add corporate feminism to the Black Nationalist message.

Either way, the statement they made here was clear, Latinos bad, Black Nationalism good...

... God I can't wait until racism is something that is shunned across the board again, because the people who like this crap deserve all the respect we give to the people that loved the original Birth of a Nation and rode around the south wearing sheets on their heads.

I expected a healthy dose of Black Nationalism when I walked in, I even expected the in your face male-hating... but I thought the racism was going to be directed at people like me, you know, white people.  Instead the racism was directed at Latinos and, for some reason, that seems even more repugnant given the hypocrisy that comes with it.",2023-03-11T19:46:37.188Z,505642,1 star,0.681769609451294
Per Gunnar Jonsson,7.0,"I have to admit that I was quite a bit hesitant about this movie. I feared this was one movie where the woke intellectual midgets of Hollywood would go overboard with their nonsense.

Luckily, the movie was more or less free of such rubbish except for maybe the lame “joke” at the end of the movie. If you are one of the woke intellectual midgets watching the movie I am sure you could find some contrived way of construing some message out of it but normal people will probably find it rather woke free.

Overall it was a pretty decent movie actually. Lot and lots of special effects and action of course and, as with Black Adams that I just reviewed, that is the main reason to watch this movie.

Unlike Black Adams, the story as a hole has more Hollywood nonsense in it though. It is good enough to propel the movie from start to finish but that is all.

The main plot of the movie is unfortunately one of those nonsensical bits. Not even a kid (actually she is not really a kid but an adult) having the misfortune of attending one of those depraved grooming and indoctrination institutes they call schools today would be stupid enough to hand over a detector that would put their African home nation in such grave danger.

Then there was that illogical rant from the Queen where she, in a emotional fit, fired her best (only) General. The cognitively impaired sock puppet might do a thing like that but not a real regent.

The part with the French in the UN was also utter rubbish. That was to please the Chinese, who are the ones that would actually do what the movie claimed the French were doing, and nothing else.

Anyway, it is still a decent movie. Certainly a lot better than quite a few Marvel/DC movies that Hollywood has produced over the last couple of years. The special effects are very nice and most of the action is quite cool.

I am somewhat concerned that they picked that rather non-charismatic and overly emotional woman to become the next Black Panther though. After all, she could have re-created the magic flower a lot earlier but instead she let her stubbornness and emotions stand in the way. Not exactly qualities you would want in the Black Panther.",2023-04-13T10:56:55.050Z,505642,3 stars,0.6217281818389893

Upon arrival, she discovers from the board that she and a nun (Josie Walker) are not to nurse at all, but to sit and watch what happens to this young girl ""Anna"" (Kíla Lord Cassidy). Is this all a fraud or is it divine intervention that is enabling this young woman to survive un-nourished but for the odd sip of water. Enter Tom Burke's rather sceptical journalist ""Will"", a local who moved to London but who still has more than his fair share of demons. Soon he and the nurse begin to bond, despite their initial difference of opinions about the whole thing and she knuckles down to discover just what is going on. Pugh is really effective here, delivering a characterisation that is considered and sympathetic but by no means gullible. The story is a slow burn, and to be honest I found the conclusion a little implausible and unsatisfactory but she and the young Cassidy carry this really well. The dialogue is sparing with some beautiful scenery that helps well to depict an Ireland still in the grip of anti-English sentiment and religious superstitions.",2022-11-11T20:01:06.632Z,823766,4 stars,0.47637811303138733

""The Wonder takes time to transform its mysterious premise into a truly captivating narrative, but the displays of Florence Pugh and especially Kíla Lord Cassidy - one of the most impressive performances to come from a 13-year-old - bear the struggles in the least relevant moments.

As a character study, the film approaches the protagonists' distinct grieving processes in a gradually more profound manner, with some surprises along the way. Filmmaker Sebastián Lelio makes the most of the atmospheric cinematography (Ari Wegner) and the contemplative score (Matthew Herbert) to elevate the slow pacing, but not always successfully.

Nathan,6.0,"The Wonder is a slow burn that fails to leave a lasting impression that most films of its type achieve.

At the forefront is the battle between science vs religion. Many citizens in the town are extremely religious and desperately want this child to be a sign from God and a gift to the town. This idea works well, and the denial of facts is quite reminiscent of today's society. But unfortunately, this film treats itself as some grand masterpiece when that isn't entirely true. It is filled with small plot holes and details that simply do not makes sense. I was bought in to a point, but the ending really falls of the rails for me and left me somewhat unsatisfied.

The performances are great, and really carry this movie. Florence Pugh is spectacular, and I will go to see any film she is in. Her portrayal of emotions is top notch and her on screen connection with Kila Lord Cassidy is well done. Speaking of Cassidy, I thought she was excellent in this film. She seemed extremely experienced and able to handle the nuances of a film of this caliber. I was shocked to see that this is really her first main role in a filmography that is somewhat empty to this point. The rest of the cast did fine.

Overall, this movie worked better as concept than what was executed. The performances were great and kept me in the film, but that should not be the only thing capturing me. It is a decent watch and one of the better Netflix projects, but that is not saying much.

Seeking help from mechanic ""James"" (Brian Tyree Henry) she appears reluctant to give him her number. She claims she doesn't recall it... He is sceptical, but as the story now evolves we discover that this young woman is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan where she suffered an injury to her brain. With the help of him, and her physician ""Dr. Lucas"" (Stephen McKinley Henderson) she now tries to put some semblance of order - and fulfilment - back into her life. It is interesting, this film, insofar as it considers the perspective of a woman returning from conflict. Assumptions are made that would probably not be made about her male counterparts, and director Lila Neugebauer tries hard to ensure that how American society deals with these distinctions is writ large. Lawrence delivers quite well, she offers a nuanced effort that can be quite poignant at times, especially as we - and ""James"" get to know her character more, and as that character begins to emerge from her shell of shame, embarrassment and mistrust. It's not very well paced, though. Despite being only ninety minutes, I felt the points reiterated just once to often and the dialogue didn't really offer much succour to either the actors or the audience. We are left to assume too much; to project our own opinions and sympathies on her persona, and without ever possibly being able to empathise that left me feeling the drama was just a bit too sterile. As with many films depicting the struggle of returning soldiers to fit in and flourish at home, it has a profound message to send - but as a piece of cinema, there are too many lingering close ups, the score is really weak and unimaginative and it's nothing much to write home about.",2022-11-19T05:18:40.479Z,595586,3 stars,0.6477000117301941

_This film was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival_

It’s tricky to tell a story about the impacts of trauma, and director Lila Neugebauer handles the subject with a sensitive, deft hand in her feature film debut “Causeway.” This intimate independent film is one with a narrative of pain, healing, and friendship, culminating in an extremely effective (and very human) drama.

While in Afghanistan working for the Army Corps of Engineers, Lynsey (Jennifer Lawrence) was part of a convoy that was attacked and hit by an explosive device. She suffered significant injuries to her body and brain, and has spent months in a tough rehabilitation program. Now the woman is finally going back to her home in New Orleans, where she is having difficulties adjusting to her return to normal society. As is the case with many veterans, Lynsey wants to redeploy, but her doctor refuses to give her the recommendation she so desperately wants. To pass the time, she takes a job cleaning pools, and when her truck breaks down on the way to work, Lynsey meets a mechanic named James (Brian Tyree Henry). The two form a bond through their mutual traumatic pasts and wounds both psychological and physical, which turns their relationship into something more complex.

The story is one of anguish, but also one of healing. You can feel the sense of inner turmoil and torment that weighs down on James and Lynsey, sinking their will to live. It’s a deeply intimate drama with a simple, strong story that makes a huge impact. Neugebauer’s film and storytelling are both beautifully crafted, further refined by the powerful, reserved performances from Lawrence and Henry (which are also among the two actors’ best work to date). Their chemistry is believable and their performances aren’t flashy, which makes for a powerful drama about broken people who need help and find it in each other.

“Causeway” is painfully eloquent in a way that makes it so much more than just another trauma drama. It’s a somber look at the way humans must suffer in order to heal, and the film captures this sentiment and feeling in the most potent way.",2023-04-23T06:44:14.581Z,595586,4 stars,0.5526864528656006

Initially their experience reminded me of ""Carry on Abroad"" (1972) with the usual building works and booking errors, but soon they settle into a comfortable poolside routine and we begin to learn a little about the dynamic between father and daughter. The occasional conversation with their absent mother tells us the parents are no longer together and a series of ongoing vacation activities paired with brief flashbacks from the adult ""Sophie"" help us to follow the young girl's attempts to get to know her father better - and he, her - as they relax in the sunshine. This features a strong and confident performance from the young Corio and there is an engaging familial dynamic here between the two. His character is protective but indulgent, her's independent and curious - and auteur Charlotte Wells allows their characterisations to develop for us in a well paced, considered fashion. Nothing really happens here - and yet so much does with their relationship and their respective maturity. It has a realism to it - there are no ""jump"" moments as such, it's about evolution and both have plenty of scope for that.

Between shaky camera syndrome and recurring flashing images that meant nothing to me, I lost the thread of the story besides the obvious, which was showing the ongoing interaction between father and daughter. Several of the quiet scenes seemed to trail off and take on the appearance of a still life picture, and then suddenly we are in the next scene, Wait, what was the previous scene all about?

CinemaSerf,7.0,"I was rather nervous about seeing this film. After his lacklustre ""debut"" in ""Don't Worry Darling"" I feared that Harry Styles was just going to turn up, smile, get naked, and that would be that. Well, to be fair, we have quite a bit more here in this engaging drama. David Dawson is also quite effective as art gallery curator ""Patrick"" who takes a bit of a shine to policeman ""Tom"" (Styles) after a cycle incident. The latter shows some interest in art and agrees to be drawn (in full constable's uniform). Nervous, ""Patrick"" gives his visitor some Scotch and well, you can imagine the rest. The thing is, of course, the UK in the 1950s was still pretty homophobic, and their behaviour must be clandestine to say the least. Simultaneously, ""Tom"" is trying to conform with a relationship with, and marriage to, ""Marion"" (Emma Corrin) but gradually she becomes aware that Princess Diana wasn't the only person to have three people in her marriage. Reported, somehow, to the authorities, ""Patrick"" faces ruin and violent imprisonment. This historical story is set within a rather less interesting template of modern day life, with the recently stroke-affected ""Patrick"" (a strong, if largely dialogue-free, effort from Rupert Everett) coming to live with the now going-through-the-motions ""Marion"" (Gina McKee) - whose reading of the invalid man's diaries provides us with the basis for the retrospective - and ""Tom"" (Linus Roache) and this rather downbeat scenario rather robs the film of any jeopardy and also drags the pace down into something akin to the soporific. Styles is not yet a very good actor. His frequent kissing scenes are quite clumsy to watch and he speaks in a sort of clipped manner suggesting the elocution people have got at him, but there is still something natural about his performance here. He gels well with the accomplished theatre actor Dawson, and the increasingly disaffected ""Marion"" is well portrayed by Corrin - all delivering a script that does enough to set the scene. It's a stylish production. Amazon have clearly thrown some money at it and combined with a pleasing score from Steven Price this presents us with a better than expected love story with just enough political sense to alert us to the difficulties faced by gay men as recently as 1957. Styles' participation in this movie is bound to raise the profile of the persecution culture that existed then, and still exists in many nations around the world now - and for that he also ought to be commended. It's a solid film, not a great one - but it is certainly worth a gander.",2022-10-25T06:29:35.336Z,744114,3 stars,0.5548109412193298

CinemaSerf,7.0,"I really did enjoy this film, but I can't say I am entirely sure what the point of it was...! Colin Farrell is ""Pádraic"", a man who routinely spends his days down the pub with his friend ""Colm"" (Brendan Gleeson) before returning home to their small dairy farm where he lives with his itchy-footed sister ""Siobhan"" (Kerry Condon). Out of the blue one day, his pal refuses to talk to him. He goes and sits elsewhere or outside their tiny pub. Nobody knows why. Confronting this head on, we discover that ""Pádraic"" is dull. He spends hours droning on about the contents of his donkey's manure and, well, poor old ""Colm"" has had enough. Indeed, so fed up is he, he swears to cut off one of his fingers - from his fiddle-playing hand - if his erstwhile buddy doesn't leave him alone. The consequences of this ostensibly trivial falling out soon spiral and that, to be fair, is where it stopped being a funny take on friendship and Irish rural life, and starts to become a bit darker and where I sort of got lost with the purpose (if there was one) or meaning of the tale. Meantime, the real star of the film - aside from the midget-donkey - is Barry Keoghan with his superbly honest portrayal of ""Dominic"". An outwardly simple lad who lives with his thuggish, policeman, father; who has the hots for ""Siobhan""; a penchant for poteen and who provides much of the humour in this entertaining and quirky observational drama. The photography of this Irish island community is glorious and the sense of community - warts and all - is well captured by Martin McDonagh's pithy writing and simple direction.

Farrell and Gleeson were, of course, nothing short of spectacular. The real surprise was the character created by Barry Keoghan. I couldn't help but be amazed by how real his character was. Although I was expecting the banshees to be like in the horror film I saw as a kid, I really appreciated the Shakespearean witch device. It was perfect in this context. The second note of flavor of this masterpiece is all about relationships in a closed community. If you ever lived in a condo, an association community or the like, you will recognize the day-to-day pettiness that everyone thinks is so important. A subtle addition to the complex layers of flavor is Burwell's perfect score. And the deep flavor of this movie?

_This film was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival_

Writer and director Martin McDonagh is no stranger to creating stories that find humor in darkness. In fact, it’s arguably what he does best. With his latest film “The Banshees of Inisherin,” McDonagh captures the sadness of a breakup between two longtime friends with his signature darkly comedic, cynical tone. It’s an emotional character study about loneliness and isolation that expertly blends humor and cruelty, and it’s one of my favorite films so far this year.

Set on a fictional remote island during the Irish Civil War of 1922, the film tells the story of buddies Pádraic (Colin Farrell) and Colm (Brendan Gleeson), two men who find themselves at an impasse. It all starts one day when Colm unexpectedly and abruptly decides to end their friendship, offering no explanation and leaving his former pal stunned and saddened. With the help of his sister Siobhán (Kerry Condon) and the troubled islander Dominic (Barry Keoghan), Pádraic plans to do whatever it takes to repair the estranged relationship. His repeated efforts to reconcile annoy Colm to the point that he delivers a shocking ultimatum, which in turn escalates the petty feud to an alarming standoff that could have violent consequences.

Working from an outline of a sad breakup, McDonagh’s script flows with a natural rhythm that’s brimming with sharp wit and wry, dark humor. This isn’t a complex narrative, but the dialogue is impassioned and poignant with a genuine understanding of the human condition. McDonagh’s writing is like no other, with a natural talent that’s enviable. The script plays directly to the specific strengths of his cast, too.

Featuring Oscar-caliber performances, Gleeson and Farrell strike the perfect harmony as Colm and Pádraic. Their rapport is natural and relaxed, and there’s a comfortable feeling between the two actors which no doubt stems from being reunited with McDonagh. This trio should continue to make movies together because something magical happens when they do. Condon and Keoghan are also excellent in this story of conflicts, as Siobhán grapples with the realization that she may risk dying from an unhappy and unfulfilled life if she continues resisting her her urge to flee, and Dominic must deal with the mental suffering of being worn down by his abusive policeman father.

The strongest supporting turns come from the scene-stealing animal actors, who represent loyalty and unconditional friendship in a story that’s peppered with a dark undercurrent. Even as the humans around them struggle with their worlds falling apart (and a civil war raging nearby), their equine and canine companions keep them grounded. One of the most memorable scenes features a touching moment between a miniature donkey and a horse, and it is one that absolutely destroyed me. It’s moments like these that add up to a fiercely affective film that is adept at delivering a highly emotional experience to the audience.

Not only is McDonagh an effective writer, but he is also a talented director with a knack for capturing and creating a mood. Working in tandem with his cinematographer Ben Davis, the film is filled with stunning photography and astonishingly gorgeous scenery of coastal Ireland. These desolate landscapes lend a natural beauty that in turn creates a strong sense of place, providing the perfect backdrop for the story.

The pressure looks set ease a little when she is introduced to a new arrival. He, Charlie, (Eddie Redmayne) is a sympathetic and engaging man with whom she gradually begins to build a (platonic) friendship. Suddenly, a patient at their hospital dies and after some feet-dragging, the police become involved in an investigation that rings loads of alarm bells. It soon becomes clear that this death is but the latest in a series of mysteriously unexplained incidents and that, perhaps, Charlie might be more involved that his friendly demeanour might suggest. It's based on a true story, so there's no jeopardy as to who did what, when and where. The film is basically a two-hander with the pair delivering competent characterisations of the two nurses. Redmayne has less to do until the ending, and there he rather hams it up a bit. Chastain has more of the game and plays her role a little more characterfully but again, the writing isn't really very good and the pace of thing is all but glacial. It has a documentary feel to it at times with a score that does little to enhance the overall lacklustre production. Interesting story, but the film is nothing at all to write home about.",2023-06-14T19:38:47.721Z,541134,3 stars,0.7046973705291748
Manuel São Bento,5.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/black-adam-spoiler-free-review

""Black Adam is far from impressive, being somewhat disappointing due to its formulaic, predictable screenplay when something different was anticipated.

Lorne Balfe's epic score and a magnificent cast - Dwayne Johnson, Aldis Hodge, and most remarkably Pierce Brosnan are phenomenal - try to elevate the decent action and visuals, but the moderate entertainment levels don't make up for the dated narrative structure.

Tiresomely heavy exposition, story with little to no creativity, and inconsistent humor make it impossible for the DCEU to take ""the next step"" in a truly impactful manner.""

Chris Sawin,3.0,"With a horrid script, lackluster performances, and a waste of potentially awesome characters, _Black Adam_ is an explosive, $195 million, anti-heroic dud. The DCEU is about to get way more convoluted and underwhelming than ever before if this is the future of live action DC films.

The Movie Mob,8.0,"**Black Adam might not reinvent the wheel, but it doesn’t have to. It just wants to take you on a fun, entertaining, exciting superhero ride!**

Black Adam has its haters, and I can understand why. It doesn’t necessarily break new ground in the superhero genre, but that doesn’t stop it from being awesome! Action-packed from start to finish. The effects are incredible. I kept myself from saying Wow out loud on multiple occasions. Dwayne Johnson’s Black Adam is absolutely ruthless, ripping armies of henchmen with ease and speed. I was worried a PG-13 rating might soften his brutality, but it did not! The action sequences looked amazing and were well done. I really liked the Justice Society characters, although they all felt a little stereotypical with a SpiderMan jokester, a wise old Professor X, and a quipping leader in the vain of Wolverine or Deadshot. Pierce Brosnan was perfect at Dr. Fate, making me wish he hadn’t been relegated to special guest star status. The movie didn’t waste a ton of time giving background on each character which was wise with so many new heroes on screen. The film had its moments of cheese but didn’t overdo it. Definitely watch the mid-credit scene. It’s stupendous! Black Adam was a fine addition to the superhero genre, and I look forward to what comes next.",2022-10-23T04:48:53.283Z,436270,4 stars,0.6584681272506714
jwilliams0511971,8.0,"> _""My powers are not a gift. They're a curse, born out of rage.""_

I had a blast watching this in theaters. This was very bombastic, with a lot of cool action, but also telling a heartfelt story about Black Adam.

It was very inventive how they depicted Black Adam's origin, keeping it a mystery up near the end. Dwayne Johnson was born to play Black Adam. He steals every scene he's in playing a badass anto-hero.

Now the Justice Society, while they didn't have a backstory in the film, they each had prequel comics detailing their backstory. Which I really dig, these comics are meant to sell comics, after all. Might as well get the audience to buy the comics to get into some great stories (they are also currently doing this with The Flash). The movie actually starts right where the Doctor Fate prequel comic ends, so I don't think it's apographa. Doctor Fate played by Pierce Brosnan was a standout. He really put his all into this character. Aldis Hodge was also a standout as Hawkman.

The surprise villain of Black Adam, Sabbac, was a really good addition to the Shazam! mythos. If the wizards have their own champion, why doesn't the seven deadly sins have one? Sabbac is the answer to that. Doctor Fate's battle with him was really cool.

Overall, this wasn't as bad as the critics were saying, I had a fun time! Be sure to stay for the mid-credits scene!",2022-10-24T02:11:46.746Z,436270,3 stars,0.3406297564506531

CinemaSerf,6.0,"In search of the all powerful crown of ""Sabbac"", ""Adrianna"" (Sarah Shahi) unleashes ""Seth-Adam"" (Dwayne Johnson) from his mountain-encased tomb deep in the desert. With super-human powers akin to ""Superman"", he returns to his home city of ""Kahndaq"" which is under the control of the ""Intergangs"". Will he decide to help her and her son ""Amon"" (Bodhi Sabongui) free them from this criminal tyranny? Well what nobody had counted on are the folks from the Justice League/Brotherhood/Department - led by ""Hawkman"" (Aldis Hodge) and ""Dr. Fate"" (Pierce Brosnan) who have decided that ""Adam"" is a bit of an wrong-un and so bring their state-of-the-art rocket ship as well as the ""Atom Smasher"" (Noah Centineo) and ""Cyclone"" (Quintessa Swindell) to capture or destroy him. Thing is, ""Adam"" is the stuff of legend to these people - reputedly having defeated an ancient despotic king - but is/was he all that he seemed? Is he good or evil or both? Well, to be honest I didn't really care. This is a very well produced and technically superb creative effort, but the story is all over the place and the repetitive combat scenes just grate after a while. Johnson has charisma, we have seen it loads of times, but here he exudes none. Hodge looks great in his winged-suit but again, his character is as deep as an Ethiopian river in July. Centineo has some fun as the giant - more than a passing resemblance to Mark Ruffalo, don't you think? Otherwise the rest of this is about as derivative as it comes. Hopefully this is just a one-off, as this is nobody's finest work and is up there with ""Morbius"" as a superhero film too many!",2022-10-25T07:08:10.692Z,436270,3 stars,0.44791123270988464
Nathan,5.0,"_Black Adam_ is in every aspect a generic superhero movie. There is nothing that really separates this for me, besides the body count that Black Adam stacks up during the film.

One thing I need to mention is the audio quality. So many lines of dialogue sound like they were recorded straight off from a cell phone. They do not match the scene at all and it was incredibly jarring throughout the entirety of the film. While I am talking about sound, in almost every fight scene the film included a badass rap song. It was cool the first time, but it got old and corny fast.

The plot was very generic from all aspects. It suffers by trying to catch the audience up in the first act. The film introduces the Justice Society and Black Adam and quickly accelerates the plot to start the main conflict of the film. It felt rushed and the conflict between the JSA and Black Adam was forced, nothing about it felt genuine. The villian in this movie was so forgettable, by the time he is introduced the conflict is over. I had zero emotional attachment to anyone in this movie. The dialogue was pretty bad as well, the scenes constantly switched from serious to comedy causing both aspects to fall flat for me.

The performances were okay, everyone was pretty average including Dwayne Johnson. Nothing spectacular and nothing bad enough for me to notice.

Overall, I was excited for this new phase and direction of the DCEU and was left disappointed. Definitely one of the poorer movies in the franchise.

Ahmad,7.0,"In all honesty, I was anticipating the same old rubbish. Neither the teaser nor the people involved left me feeling optimistic. To my surprise, I got a rather well-crafted superhero film that, despite its imperfections, is still superior to the vast bulk of its genre’s offerings in recent years. Coming from the DCEU, which has produced some of the most inconsistent content in recent memory, and starring Dwayne Johnson as the lead, who, apart from his charm and muscular physique, isn’t exactly known for his acting talents. In many respects, “Black Adam” had more going against it than for it.

Nevertheless, thanks to director Jaume Collet-Serra, writers Adam Sztykiel, Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani, and a supporting ensemble that makes the most out of a script that is at best passable, “Black Adam” manages to stand out from the recent run of lacklustre comic book films. It manages to establish a broader universe without appearing forced while introducing some new concepts to the genre. “Black Adam’s” most distinctive characteristic is the way it refuses to settle for any clear-cut morality. It all adds up to a film that succeeds more often than not.

In 2019, when the Infinity Saga ended, you couldn’t have convinced me that I’d be more interested in the DCEU than the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But fast-forward three years, and that is precisely what has happened; DCEU has produced some good content during that time (Zack Snyder’s Justice League, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker). The future seems bright for the DCEU!

MovieGuys,6.0,"""Its alright."" I know, its hardly a resounding endorsement but Black Adam, is just that.

To be fair the super human genre is pretty formulaic by its very nature. Its simplistic narrative and story telling, often with a very pro American, globalist message, as is the case here, does not resonate terribly well with a sophisticated, mature audience.

So rather than pick on its predictable shortcoming's let's look at what it does do well. 

Firstly, I think the choice of Dwayne Johnson as the lead , is a good one. Usually associated with nice guys roles, its interesting to see him cast as someone flawed, with a darker, personality. His physicality plays well here, too. He's intimidating physically, with a strong presence that fits well with this brooding, ominous, characterisation. 

The action that runs the length of this film is well paced and visually spectacular, if a little repetitive. This is not a boring film, if you are in the mood for lightweight, action fare. 

Special effects, are unsurprisingly, of a high standard too and do breathe a little extra life, into this production.

In summary, you know what you are getting when you watch these US made super human flicks. Its lightweight action fare, with a pro US, globalist message. That said, there's enough on offer here to make it mildly entertaining, nonetheless.",2022-11-30T00:49:27.732Z,436270,3 stars,0.6535121202468872

GenerationofSwine,10.0,"OK, this isn't a bad movie.  

But, it as a bit much CGI (like everything else nowadays) and I think modern audiences are getting tired of paying out the wazoo to basically watch a video game.

And then the narration.  The voice is too young and though it does make sense with the plot, it is jarring because basic tradition is that narrations have an older and wiser voice... Morgan Freeman, Spock, etc.  So that is going to instantly set the radiance off.

And then the Snyderverse is over.  Period.  They made no illusions about that, we have known it was over for years, there was even a massive backlash about his cut of Justice League because it was given the fans what they wanted and thus bad... because politics and politics have declared that people that are enthusiastic about anything that isn't left wing politics are evil.

Because the world has gone insane.

But the greater point is that people already don't care.  They not only already don't care, but they were sort of told not to by the very people that made the movie.  

It's world is over.  This world ended before it was released.

Which, sucks, because Shazam was my favorite to come out of the DCEU.

People aren't going to care.  They aren't going to watch it and when they do it's going to come with disdain.

But as far as a Superhero movie goes... come on, you're not really getting much.  They aren't Chinatown, they are just popcorn munchers and nothing more, and that isn't bad.  But let's call it what it is.

Unless they are political like the MCU, they are just mindless action and gags.  And if they are political like the MCU, they sort of stink.

This is relatively politics free.  It's high on adventure and so-so on action (see the above CGI comment) so you have a decent film for the genre. It just should have come out before they declared the universe dead.",2023-01-17T19:12:03.280Z,436270,3 stars,0.6979721784591675

Per Gunnar Jonsson,8.0,"I quite enjoyed this movie. Given the story (some superhero wakes up 5000 year later) I was a bit afraid that it would be a lot of unintelligent Hollywood slapstick humor with Black Adam trying to adapt to modern society. There where a little bit of that but, luckily, not too much.

I did actually have some hopes for this movie given that those woke intellectual midgets that the rubbish site Rotten Tomatoes calls critics gave it a rotten rating whereas the actual audience gave it a near 90% fresh rating.

Overall it is a decent story without too many ludicrous elements in it. It works pretty well from start to finish.

The Rock is, well, he is The Rock which is good. He did play a more serious character in this movie than he has done in many of his movies though. Pierce Brosnan (I actually didn’t recognize him at first) worked very well as Dr Fate. The rest of the characters was okay but nothing to write home about.

It is a superhero movie so of course there were plenty of special effects, CGI and action. That is really the main reason to watch these movies and I enjoyed every moment of it. Especially when Black Adams let loose.

The action is sometimes quite violent actually with limbs and heads flying. I don’t mind at all. There are way too many movies that some Hollywood bean counter has forced the producers/directors to ruin because they thought it would appeal to a larger audience. Well, then pick a story that is made for that audience you stupid morons.

As usual the mid credits scene hinted that there would be more movies with Black Adams and, as long as they keep The Rock as Black Adams in them I can certainly see myself watch more Black Adams.",2023-04-13T10:12:32.261Z,436270,4 stars,0.5968183875083923
Ahmetaslan27,6.0,"**There is nothing to dazzle with the DC Universe in the year 2022**


If you decide not to enter this movie into the cinemas, you will not miss except two things. The first is a very impressive Post Credit Scene, and the second is the opportunity to see the largest group of characters that look like hell.

It is the 11th film between the extended DC universe films and the only movie from this world that will be shown in 2022, in addition to the Batman 2022 movie, which shows events that don't take place in the universe that exists inside The Black Adam. As for the superheroes and comic book films in general, this film is considered the fourth for the year 2022.

This is generally true for super hero films, comic books, and things like that. The year 2022 didn't get anything remarkable for fans of this type of movie. I see it as a year that is not remarkable for this type of movie. The events focused on the character of Black Adam, who has a relationship in one way or another, and who is an extension of the personality of Shazam, which we saw within the DC world.

The events revolve around Black Adams, which is the new name that was given to him, and he is the protector of the city of Kahndaq, and he was in a stable state for 5,000 years, but he returns to modern times to fight a number of mercenaries who took control of the city called Intergang and continuously plundered the city's resources.

Black Adam's personality and methods of dealing with enemies do not apply to superheroes because he is violent and bloody, and these methods attract the attention of Amanda Waller, especially since his strength is very strong because he is considered a hero with very exceptional superpowers because his strength extends from the same source as the power of Shazam. That's why Amanda Waller decided to summon the Justice Society to capture Black Addams and control his powers.

My expectations for the Black Adams movie were medium to low. I didn't have high hopes before I watched the movie. It's probably due to DC's recent reliance on hilarious films with entertaining content, whose essence is devoid of epic content and bloated drama, which also doesn't contain things that don't. It dosent have anymore to make the viewer is shocked or surprised, and it is also not a condition that the film contains an artist with extensive talent in the world of acting. I'm not talking about actors specifically, I'm talking about superheroes, although it might apply to actors as well.

When I found out that The Rock is playing the role, I set my expectations in this place, which is that there is nothing new in this movie that makes you dazzled by it. 6/10",2023-06-11T18:35:25.469Z,436270,3 stars,0.4975670278072357

r96sk,7.0,"<em>'Black Adam'</em> holds hits and misses aplenty, but I think I got enough out of it by the time the credits rolled.

The most standout part of this 2022 DCEU flick is its humour, albeit weirdly. What I mean is that I found the comedy to actually be fairly amusing, much more so than I was anticipating, but the way it is placed into other events onscreen is very messy and almost forced.

It's as if they made the whole movie without humour and then went back and placed bits throughout. Like I'd be watching a gag and it would make me at least smirk, though it would be surrounded by more serious moments so it comes across as unconnected. It's weird, perhaps just a me thing.

Lorne Balfe's music is good, I particularly enjoyed ""The Justice Society Theme"" in the end titles - added it to my playlist already! As for this film's other elements, I found the action to be well done - and as such the editing. The special effects at the beginning for Kahndaq's backstory isn't great though, I've seen a lot of films (early 2010s, mind you) use that sorta effect and it rarely comes out positively.

Cast-wise, I have no negatives. Dwayne Johnson fits the titular character as you'd expect, I wouldn't say his performance is anything all that great but what he gives is enough - when coming to terms with Amon's superhero ideas, Johnson plays off the 'learning on the job' angle well.

Aldis Hodge, Pierce Brosnan and Sarah Shahi are solid. Mohammed Amer offers good comedic relief, definitely the one that got the most chuckles out of me. The characters of Noah Centineo and Quintessa Swindell feel derivative, though Marwan Kenzari is thankfully more villainy here than he is in 2019's <em>'Aladdin'</em>.

A more thorough execution and I may have loved this. In the absence of that, I'd simply class it as passable.",2023-11-17T21:22:25.765Z,436270,3 stars,0.6106699109077454
Justin Totino,3.0,"**_This review contains spoilers._**

“The hierarchy of power in the DC Universe is about to change” is the catchphrase that star Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson kept spouting about this movie as it was in production and being promoted after wrapping. It was meant to be both in and out of character. Now James Gunn is in charge so, in a way, Rock was right. And to think Rock has supposedly been trying to get this film made since what, 2008, I think? It was not worth the wait. The film is not very good. That’s not to say that _some_ of the action isn’t entertaining but for the most part it is very repetitive; Black Adam is so superhuman and powerful that every fight is him letting thousands of bullets bounce off him before he throws dudes across the world or electrocutes them. That's it. That's every fight scene. 

Black Adam’s character arc is nonexistent. He goes from scene to scene because they have to get to the next bit of action, not because there is anything driving him. They try some really weak comedic bits. A dash of “kid teaches badass killer things to say” from <i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day </i>(1992). When he surrenders to the JSA, it’s only because we’re at the third act, not because he actually learned anything. The movie acts as if his backstory was a big twist or reveal when it was in all the trailers. Ignoring the fact that prior to this film, in this Zack Synder created DC film universe Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman have all killed people; for all the nonsensical “heroes don’t kill” back and forth Black Adamn has with Hawkman (Aldis Hodge), in the end Black Adam has to kill the big bad anyway - and does so with ease and so quickly, because he’s so awesome and powerful - because that’s the only way the villain can be stopped at all. So all the arguing was pointless anyway.

Speaking of Hawkman, we spent so much time with the Justice Society of America that it could have easily just been a JSA movie instead. The whole cast of that team are the film’s highlights and even they can only do so much with what they are given, which is… not much. I feel bad for both Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) and Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell). While the two are good in their roles and are cute together, they don’t do much in the film. Pierce Brosnan is an excellent Dr. Fate and is the only one on the team that feels like a full character. Or maybe he’s just that damn good in the role. We know nothing about Hawkman and because of that he feels like he’s been simmered down to “Iron Man but with wings”. Is he the alien version of Hawkman? Is he the immortal human version? We don't know. It would have been more interesting to go with the immortal/reincarnation version of the character, so that he can relate to Black Adam in some way, and then their butting heads on the kill/no kill topic would make some sense. This version of Hawkman, who has lived a thousand lifetimes, could have been one who at one time had his own rage, killing all who got in his way, who then later found the value in letting those live even if they may not deserve it. There is such a better and more interesting story here and it was squandered to feed Rock's ego.

Rock was so confident that this movie was going to shake things up, that Black Adam was going to be the Thanos of the DC Universe, and be in every movie going forward, that he forced WB to being back Henry Cavill for a cameo. So not only did Cavill never get a chance to be in a _good_ Superman movie but his final portrayal was a cameo that was never going to lead to anything else afterwards anyway.

Nathan,4.0,"_Halloween Ends_ is such a weird film, as a standalone movie I enjoyed it but in the trilogies totality it underwhelms and undermines. With each entry in this trilogy, the movies get farther and farther away from what Halloween is. With Ends there is no tension and no horror, there are some good kills but with nothing building up to it they felt stale. This movie also tears down Michael Meyers in a way that felt out of place in the trilogy. Halloween Kills built Michael up to be an indestructible force with the ability to withstand fire or multiple gunshot wounds, but in Ends that is flipped on its head making him weak due to the ending of the predecessor. It left me feeling like the writers had no idea what they were doing in developing this trilogy. The marketing of the movie was a total farce as well. It was building up to a final clash between Laurie and Michael, and while that does happen the majority follows a character that was just introduced (Corey Cunningham). Even though I really like the opening sequence and backstory to Corey, it had no place being centerstage in the final installment. Overall, this movie was slightly better than the sequel but still squanders the potential that Halloween (2018) had for the trilogy. If any more movies or trilogies are made in the future, please for the love of God hire a producer/writer to develop the entire series instead of piecing it together film by film.

Even the final showdown between Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Myers was satisfying, although the story didn’t build to the climax well. Sadly that is where the pros stop. The story was a convoluted mess that ignored all the build-up of the first two films and focused on a new character that didn’t matter to the overall story and didn’t have much impact on the film. As a result, Halloween Ends forgot what made its two predecessors successful and told a pointless meandering tale that had its moments but ultimately disappointed.",2022-10-15T17:27:31.975Z,616820,2 stars,0.6743340492248535
MovieGuys,4.0,"An unfortunate end, to a horror franchise, that started way back in 1978. 

Halloween Ends, is an inarticulate mess, that fails to build on past films. Instead, it delivers an incomprehensible story, that makes little to no sense, save that it brings the overriding story, to a somewhat confused, conclusion. 

On the upside solid acting and some tense, jump scare moments but really, its not enough.

TwiceONCE2016,8.0,"It's a sad state of affairs when HALLOWEEN ENDS (2022) is being classed as a ""bad"", ""terrible"" or ""disgraceful"" motion picture and I worry for cinema as a whole if the only direction the mass want is nothing but cookie-cutter.

This film is a straaaaaaange beast and it probably holds the world record for the quickest development of a relationship on screen. Bloody hell, I wanted that relationship to succeed.

I'm going to be controversial here... did we need Michael Myers at all here? Maybe the 2 or so scenes we get in the sewer early into the film and that's it... maybe pass the evil on and Michael die of his wounds.

The evil is contagious element worked for me and Corey (played by Rohan Campbell) was the standout character.

Issues? Yes, there are some - the narration and memoir aspect weren't needed and Corey's mum... erm, I'll leave it there.
But I admire this film, oh boy do I. I'd rather the risk be taken than them fall back into the same old routine.

Chris Sawin,6.0,"_Halloween Ends_ does provide what it promises and that’s a proper end to the Laurie Strode saga. However, the birth of a new rushed, hot-headed, and sloppier version of The Shape seems to take precedence only to be squashed before Laurie and Michael meet one last time. Entertaining at times and frustrating at others, _Halloween Ends_ is a bloody scenic route of a conclusion that is mostly satisfying despite its underappreciated albeit risky detours.

Otherwise, this is just one ""Halloween"" movie too many and it's only scream yells ""put me out of my misery"" pretty much from the start of this slow and plodding denouement to the franchise. Rohan Campbell (""Corey"") is bullied by some kids who end up shoving him from a bridge. He is dragged into the storm drains by you know who and emerges a man possessed. He has also attached himself to ""Allyson"" (Andi Matichak) who just happens to be the daughter of long suffering ""Laurie"" (Jamie Lee Curtis) and after a bit of hysteric family melodrama, all of her demons are flee-flowing and we are heading, slowly and ponderously to a conclusion that the best of which has already been seen many times in the trailers. This is far too long, virtually nothing happens until the last fifteen minutes and even then, there isn't even the vaguest hint of menace or jeopardy. The production is adequate, but JLC doesn't really feature often enough - as in ""Halloween Kills"" (2021) to make much impact - and the whole thing is episodic and smacks of made for television. Please let it be the final instalment - this bears no resemblance whatsoever to the original 1978 introduction to ""Myers"" et al.",2022-10-20T10:04:38.144Z,616820,2 stars,0.4947080910205841

r96sk,7.0,"My favourite of the most recent three, if not of them all.

<em>'Halloween Ends'</em> gave me more than I was expecting, if I'm honest. After the solid if slightly underwhelming <em>'Halloween Kills'</em> I thought this may fall further adrift but, happily, it doesn't. I think that I like this the most of all twelve entries after the original, which is probably still a jot above this one in my mind.

I won't repeat myself too much as I've summed up my overall thoughts on this franchise in prior reviews of those other flicks, but in short I enjoyed this release more consistently throughout and the characters actually interested me a fair amount.

Jamie Lee Curtis is, obviously, the star of the show, but Rohan Campbell is a great addition and Andi Matichak gives her best showing of these David Gordon Green films. In previous installments the cast behind (or sometimes in place of) Curtis have failed to truly entertain me, perhaps aside from the first one and (minimally) <em>'Halloween H20: 20 Years Later'</em>, but here I was happy to follow the scenes involving those behind Curtis.

I will say that the third act lost me a little in terms of interest, though that's only ever so slightly as all in all I had a good time with this.

Ah, thinks he - a fortune to be made. He puts just about everything he has on the line but poor old ""Lyle"" has stage fright... won't sing! Ruin befalls our entertainer so he leaves his home in the hands of the ""Primm"" family. Not long after they move in, the son ""Josh"" (a creditable effort from Winslow Fegley) hears noises in the attic and off we go on the more standard series of escapades peppered with some tunes and hysterical antics from his slightly surprised parents, an intervention from the city authorities and a gently pleasing conclusion that does elicit just the merest hint of a tear. Shawn Mendez (""Lyle"") has one of those voices that I find instantly forgettable, and the pens of ""Dear Evan Hansen"" creators Benj Pasek and Justin Paul really don't bombard us with much to get the toes tapping aside from, perhaps, ""Top of the World"". The storyline reminded me a lot of ""Clifford the Big Red Dog"" (2021) - child and curious pet deal with fun adventures and mishaps - and as a gently entertaining piece of drama this does fine.

Nathan,6.0,"_Terrifier 2_ is a massive improvement over its parent film but doesn't quite do enough to move the needle for me. From the get-go, this films tone and quality is drastically superior to the previous entry. The writing gives characters room to develop, and audiences can actually grow attached to characters in way that was blatantly absent from the first film. I enjoyed the added lore for Art that was sprinkled throughout, adds a level of depth to the newly founded horror icon. The writing allows for much more creative kills and set pieces, with the story taking place across an entire town rather than one claustrophobic apartment building. But with all those improvements, there are still lingering problems that carried over from the first film. Actor performances were all over the board. Some actresses were really compelling and honestly shocked me for the indie type feel of the film. Some notable highlights for me were the lead actress _Lauren LaVera_, _Kailey Hyman_, and _Elliott Fullam_. But other performances were legitimately bad, it felt like I was watching a high school drama production. There are some major pacing problems, for starters this movie is almost 2.5 hours long. There is no need for a runtime this long, there is so much fluff in here that it really bogs down the flow of the film. This movie does a better job of adding suspense to its scenes but is too reliant on blood and gore to get its gasps from the audience. I normally am one to appreciate when a movie goes above and beyond in the gore department, but this movie went overboard. So many scenes had be physically ill due to the graphic content. Sometimes less is more and that is for sure the case here. Despite its flaws, this is a great next step for this small-time studio and with the success at the box office there will surely be a sequel where Dameon Leone has the opportunity to craft a real top notch horror film.

Positives:

The kills. Very brutal and gory. I would say bloodier than the first. 
I think there is more of a story than in the first Terrifier. More character development with the brother and sister.

Negatives

I think 2 hrs 18 mins is way too long. I feel that in the middle it was a little slow and could have been cut.
I was hoping for more of a backstory of Art the Clown but they spent more time on the brother and sister than him.
Does Terrifier 2 fit into the Terrifier franchise? Yes. If you enjoyed the first movie you should watch Terrifier 2. If you were on the fence about the first one, check this one out. If you don’t like blood and gore, pass on this movie.

It's more or less the same as the last one, only this time our menacingly rampaging clown ""Art"" is targeting would be trick-or-treaters on Halloween. Personally, I'm with him all the way as that's an habit that deserves all it gets with irritating spoilt kids marauding the streets demanding candy. Utilising to best effect his natural disguise, ""Art"" alights on ""Sienna"" (Lauren Silva) and her geeky brother ""Jonathan"" (Elliott Fulham) and a-slashing we all go. Unfortunately, the acting and writing aren't up to much but that's not so bad as the repetitively procedural nature of the gory violence. From one implausible scenario to another and with characters who make the most stupid of decisions when facing a crisis, we plod along relentlessly with loads of screaming and histrionics. It's just like one of those video games where the dead never stay dead for long, and so with this immortality comes a sense of ennui as the plot struggles to engage or innovate and ends up like an extended edition of ""Scooby Do"".

Visually, it’s really well done, and the way Mike Barker brought Ani’s world to life was impressive. The contrast between her seemingly perfect life and the darker, more haunting parts of her past was captured beautifully.

That being said, the plot felt a bit too packed for me. It’s like they tried to cram too much into the runtime, which made the storyline feel rushed and kind of hectic at times. Some parts that could have been explored more deeply were glossed over, and it made the pacing feel uneven. It’s almost like they were trying to do too much at once.

I also felt like the movie didn’t always let things sink in properly. Some of the more intense moments felt like they were brushed past too quickly, which took away from the emotional impact. It’s a shame because there are some powerful themes in there that could’ve hit harder if they’d had more room to breathe.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"As a man who really struggles with romcoms at the best of times, I was rather nervous about this. Actually, though, it steers clear of some (though not all) of the gay stereotypes and presents us with a genuinely quite funny love story about two forty-somethings who meet in a nightclub. One, ""Bobby"" (Billy Eichner) is a ordinary looking, gobby podcaster and activist who is trying to raise the money needed for an American National LGBTQ+ museum. The other is ""Aaron"" (Luke Macfarlane) - a lawyer who spends a fair amount of time on the cross-fit. They wouldn't appear to be the most natural of fits but a series of brief encounters on their opening night coupled with a fair degree of sarcasm and a kiss sets the tone for what happens next. Certainly, anyone who has a Dekkoo subscription will have seen the format before - and often, and this doesn't really vary the theme much. What does make this different is the characters have much more depth. Their relationship is never going to be straightforward and though sometimes delivered via annoyingly angry monologues, the character of ""Bobby"" makes some fairly profound and well reasoned arguments about the constraints history has imposed on people of differing sexualities over the years. Eichner is effective as a man who uses his sharp and pithy tongue to prove the best form of defence is attack, Macfarlane proves to be far more than the man with the muscle, and the writing from the former and director Nicholas Stoller clearly demonstrates that both men have skin in this particular game. Experience has clearly informed and fuelled this creative process. It can be a bit hit or miss, especially the third quarter when it all becomes a bit contrived, but the ending redeems it rather - if only for the pure schmaltz of the serenade - and I rather enjoyed it. It sure doesn't need a cinema screening, but it is entertainingly provocative at times. The BBFC slide at the top warned of ""strong sex"". Clearly they have never watched ""Theo and Hugo"" (2016) because there is nothing at all visual in this that could conceivably cause offence; even the language is comparatively mild.",2022-10-20T23:01:20.272Z,614939,4 stars,0.5598103404045105

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,7.0,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

I didn’t expect much out of co-writer and director Nicholas Stoller‘s “Bros,” a film billed as the first mainstream gay romantic comedy. In the wrong hands, a film with such lofty ambitions could feel like an overreach in political correctness or an exercise in forced representation. Thankfully the project is neither, and it makes great strides in further normalizing homosexual relationships onscreen.

Podcaster and new head of the country’s first LGBTQ+ history museum Bobby (Billy Eichner) is a cynical gay man living in New York. He’s never had a relationship that lasted more than a couple of months, and he’s not really out and about looking for love. After some random hookups, Bobby meets a hunky lawyer Aaron (Luke Macfarlane) at a club, and they seem like complete opposites. Neither is the other’s type, and they disagree on things like styles of working out and the best music (Mariah vs. Garth Brooks). Of course, that’s when the sparks fly. The men start spending more time together, and a true love story blossoms.

This is a film where almost every character is gay, transgender, or bisexual, and the R-rated language is as racy as some of the bedroom scenes (there’s no graphic nudity, if you’re bothered by that sort of thing). It’s bold and refreshing, even if some of the material is unapologetically in your face. This may be what makes the film a hard sell for mainline conservative audiences but for those with open minds, there’s something liberating about seeing a universal love story. In fact, one of the best compliments I can give to the film is that you’d actually forget the lovebirds are two gay men if not for the constant reminders in the script (everyone is always talking about it).

Eicher and Stoller (who co-wrote the script) build their narrative from classic romantic comedy tropes, proving that some jokes are universal. It certainly follows a tried-and-true formula, but it works. The film captures with honesty the different stages of new relationships, from the meet cute to infatuation, and on to the awkward phase and the kiss-and-make-up period. There’s something here that everyone can relate to, even if there are a fair share of LGBTQ+-specific one-liners.

It’s great to see a conventional rom-com with an unconventional twist. It’s witty and insightful, has affable characters, and two leads with great chemistry and even better comedic timing. The film has an underlying sincerity and doesn’t feel gimmicky, which is a huge step towards an even greater acceptance for all relationships. “Bros” is a romantic comedy that will make you laugh, tug on your heartstrings, and flat-out make you feel happy.",2023-04-23T06:37:43.938Z,614939,4 stars,0.4308176040649414

garethmb,-1.0,"After four theatrical and six direct-to-video releases “Hellraiser” has been given a reboot as a cinematic release for Hulu.

For those not familiar with the series based on a story by Clive Barker, it involves a cube-shaped puzzle box that when opened summons demons known as Cenobites who demand sacrifices and promise great rewards to those who summon them.

Naturally, their version of rewards is the stuff of nightmares as the line between pleasure and pain for them is even more distorted than their horrific visages leading those who encounter them to plead for death but often face tortures beyond imagination.

The new take on the series stars Odessa A’zion as Riley, a recovering addict who is living with her brother and his boyfriend as well as a roommate. Her brother is concerned over her relationship with her boyfriend as he believes anyone she met in recovery is not stable enough to support her in her times of need.

Desperate for money; Riley is convinced to take objects from an abandoned warehouse but finds only the mysterious puzzle box which she in time is able to reconfigure to one of the various options it is capable of. In doing so, she summons the Cenobites who promptly take her brother which forces Riley and her friends not only to question her sobriety but her sanity as well.

As they attempt to understand the nature of what is happening to them, their investigation leads them to a larger puzzle and encounters with more Cenobites including their leader Pinhead (Jamie Clayton) whose at times cryptic messages can tempt and torment those who try to survive and manipulate the events they find themselves in.

What follows is a mix of tension and gore as personal ambitions, survival, temptation, and base emotions are tempted as the characters attempt to understand a complex and rapidly changing nightmare from which there seems to be no escape.

While the new version does have a slow and more deliberate pace leading up to the finale, it was engaging enough to hold my interest. For me, the theatrical films became at times redundant as they did not advance the mythos as much as up the gore in an attempt to keep the audiences coming. The fact that the last theatrical release had the Director remove his name from the film shows how things had deteriorated too.

The six video releases were hit and miss with Barker no longer being involved and eventually the same for original Pinhead Doug Bradley who no longer wanted to be part of a series where a film was produced in a matter of weeks simply to maintain the rights.

This time around thanks to a good cast and effects along with a story that is true to the mythos yet updated and engaging, the franchise has had a much-needed new direction and it will be interesting to see where it goes next as there are already rumors of a prequel in the works.

Hulu has done well with their recent “Predator” film “Prey” which has invigorated the franchise and this new outing is not only ideal for their format but a fresh step for the franchise.

You can check out “Hellraiser” on Hulu on October 7th.",2022-10-04T18:40:33.420Z,338947,4 stars,0.46876028180122375

garethmb,-1.0,"With a star-laden cast and acclaimed Director David O. Russell at the helm, the new film “Amsterdam” arrives and touts a story mostly based on real events.

Following injuries they sustained serving in WWI, Dr. Burt Berendsen (Christian Bale) and Harold Woodman (John David Washington) return to New York to find a world where Veterans are not as welcome as they thought and racial division remains for Harold despite fighting for his country.

Burt having lost an eye in the war finds that his uptown In-Laws and wife shipped him to the war to get him out of the way as his mixed Catholic and Jewish heritage is not ideal for their version of society nor is his insistence on helping Vets at his practice over the cream of society.

When a wealthy socialite Liz Meekins (Taylor Swift) hires Harold to investigate what she believes is the murder of her prominent father, Burt is asked for his medical verification. When an unexpected event arises, Burt and Harold find themselves the leading suspects and must seek to find a way to clear their names from an ever-deepening mystery, one that brings them back into the circle of a former associate who treated them during the war named Valerie (Margot Robbie). The fact that Harold and Valerie had a relationship in Amsterdam following the war and that Burt was the adored friend of both further complicates the matter.

With complications mounting, the three must find a way to solve the mystery and save the day before the end of either dead or being charged for crimes they are innocent of with an ever-growing cast of characters and suspects for them to contend with.

The visuals of the film are solid as they capture the look and sounds of New York in the 1930s and the cast and costumes also lead to a fantastic level of immersion. Bale is so good as his character as it is hard to believe it is him as he transforms himself completely into a new being with a distinctive look, sound, and mannerisms which underscores how he is one of the most gifted and versatile actors ever.

The entire cast is very good from the leads to the supporting players but what hampers the film from truly achieving is that it is very slow and at times self-indulgent in the pacing and story.

There is an interesting premise, great cast, great performances, and solid visuals, but the film drags on without any regard to pacing, dramatic tension, or real surprises which in the end makes watching it a long task without the payoff one would expect, especially for the time the audiences has invested.

In the end, the film delivers entertainment and great performances but lacks the pacing and payoff to make the trip fully worthwhile.

The Movie Mob,6.0,"**Amsterdam's uneven pacing and erratic story mishandled its amazing potential and left me wondering when it would finally end.**

Amsterdam comes roaring out of the gate with a fast-paced, quirky, charming, and unique mystery of the likes of Sherlock Holmes or Knives Out. The list of celebrities and actors continues to grow as almost every face in this movie is another a-lister making an entertaining appearance. I was so excited to see what happened next and was surprised when the story suddenly screeched to a halt for a very long slow flashback that didn't offer much to the plot. I hoped the exciting pace would return when the story returned to its original narrative, but the risk and urgency had been replaced by a scattered collection of arbitrary dialogue and scenes that lingered much longer than needed. The pacing lagged almost an hour before ramping back up in the final act. Amsterdam had so much potential but floundered in its attempts to be whimsical and unique. The film's best part was Michael Shannon and Mike Myers' quirky bird-loving spies. Every time they were on the screen, I couldn't help but laugh. Christian Bale logged another amazing performance, as expected. But even with entertaining characters, great performances, and an exciting opening and conclusion, Amsterdam fumbled all its fantastic elements and ended up making my eyes heavy and my heart yearn to go to bed early.",2022-10-06T04:26:47.458Z,664469,2 stars,0.523047685623169
Nathan,7.0,"_Amsterdam_ does nothing to reinvent the wheel but does everything well enough that I had a pleasant time in the theater. The performances all around were excellent. Christian Bale was brilliant in this film, every new role Bale finds himself in he knocks out of the park, and I continually ask myself what can't he do? Margot Robbie was really great too. In many of her roles, her Harley Quinn mannerisms creep in and while I find that fun it was really refreshing to see her get away from that in Amsterdam. John David Washington was fine in his role, I never really find him to have great performances, but always does enough to get the job done, that can be said again with his performance here. The supporting roles were all fine too Raimi Malek and Anna Taylor-Joy did well and had funny chemistry together. Mike Myers and Robert De Niro did fine as well. While the story was not overly original, I had a blast following it to its finality. There are many fun twists and turns along the way and found a way to keep me gripped and entertained throughout it's near two- and half-hour runtime. While many critics are giving these harsh reviews, I think it is a good film that is fun watch despite its flaws.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Even if it is based on true events, it's all just a bit to slapstick and fa-fetched for me. The story centres around ""Berendsen"" (Christian Bale) who is asked by his pal ""Woodman"" (John David Washington) to help out the widowed ""Mrs. Meekins"" (Taylor Swift) whose husband - a former American general - has mysteriously died. A slightly dodgy autopsy follows and pretty soon, someone has gone under the wheels of a car and our two gents are being sought by the police and by a clandestine organisation. Can they stay free and can we discover what is truly going on? Well David O. Russell decides to tell the story by chopping and changing the timelines, and so we retrace our steps to a WWI hospital where both men find themselves in the care of the slightly enigmatic nurse ""Valerie"" (Margot Robbie) who collects the shrapnel she takes from their wounded bodies and makes works of art from it. The three form an immutable bond before time and circumstances drive them apart, only for them to reunite unexpectedly as their current-day dilemma reaches it's denouement. The film looks great, certainly. The attention to detail, the costumes and the score all work well. It's the narrative, though, that really struggled for me. The story is just too insubstantial to sustain the 2¼ hour running time and as ever, I found Robbie a remarkably sterile actress to watch. Nobody could ever cause Bale of not trying, but there is a distinct lack of on-screen chemistry across the board here. None of that is helped by Rami Malek's rather underwhelming contribution as ""Tom"" - her wealthy if eccentric and clearly manipulating brother. Oddly enough, I found myself thinking this had something of the Agatha Christie to it - and maybe it would have worked better with a much tighter cast on a stage where the humour and quirkiness of the characterisations could have been better exploited? As it is, though, this sort of meanders back and forth with little impetus and I have to say I was a bit bored half way through.",2022-10-20T11:01:21.308Z,664469,3 stars,0.6048732399940491

It takes a bit too long for the the Divine Miss M and company to take to the screen, before that this is a rather muddled teenage affair, but once they are in full swing it is quite good fun with plenty of faux malevolence from ""Winifred"" and some mischief from her sisters once they discover that they, too, can zap folks. Ultimately, even the book of spells gets to choose it's own destiny - but whom will it follow? Star of the film is definitely ""Billy Butcherson"" - or his disembodied head, and a lively reversion of Blondie's ""One Way or Another"" gets the toes tapping away nicely too.

Werewolf by Night is my favorite Marvel film so far this year. The stylized approach with the black and white filter and film grain was a bold choice that gave the movie great atmosphere and nostalgia. Werewolf by Night embraced the horror genre and violence slightly more than other Marvel movies, with villains losing limbs and being eaten. However, it’s still a Disney+ special at the end of the day, so I wouldn’t call it particularly scary or violent. As a fan of Elsa Bloodstone in the comics, I enjoyed her character’s role and backstory in the movie, which connected this isolated creature feature to a greater universe. The creative choices, great but not overdone effects, the introduction of new heroes, and the horror approach make Werewolf by Night one of the best recent entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",2022-10-08T04:24:47.507Z,894205,4 stars,0.6471717357635498

tmdb51616167,7.0,"The film ""Werewolf by Night"" pleasantly surprised me with its creative twist. Initially a black-and-white production, it captured my attention in a way I hadn't anticipated. The unique presentation in monochrome added to the film's appeal, and I particularly enjoyed the nod to ""The Wizard of Oz"" where the transition to color was a memorable touch.

This movie is definitely worth a watch - it may not be lengthy, but it offers an intriguing experience worth delving into. I've personally watched it three times and found enjoyment in each viewing.

What sets this film apart is that it doesn't detract from the thrilling excitement of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU); rather, it prompts contemplation on how it will fit into the larger narrative. This leaves me with the biggest question: how will it intertwine with the MCU, considering its unique approach that hasn't been explored in other ways before?

The Movie Mob,2.0,"**Smile’s creepy trailers and clever marketing were the best parts of a movie with a meager plot drenched in uneasy sounds, and way too many jump scares.**

Smile obsesses over saturating every moment in unsettling dread. The score and sound effects make every moment uneasy and uncomfortable, and not in a good way. Smile’s premise bore many similarities to It Follows with much poorer execution. Smile stumbled from jump scare to jump scare. I started closing my eyes because the jump scares were so predictable, and I was tired of having disturbing images screamed in my face. I will say that Sosie Bacon did an excellent job with what she was given, with her performance being the only bright spot in the film. Unfortunately, the movie was unimpressive and tried to cloak mediocrity in a fountain of jump scares, stressful noises, and unpleasant moments.",2022-09-29T04:05:24.726Z,882598,2 stars,0.6070225834846497
Nathan,7.0,"As an avid horror fan, I can genuinely say that Smile unsettled me beyond belief. In many horror films of today, directors rely solely on jump scares to create this sense of shock and horror. But in Smile, Parker Finn is able to build suspense and tension throughout a scene to then crescendo into a jump scare that the audience knows is coming but are so tense that they cannot help but to release into fright.

While this movie does not break major ground in terms of plot and storytelling there is some depth that is added with mental health and the feeling of isolation during manic episodes. I felt for Rose throughout this entire film, as she used to be the one helping patients through mental crisis and now that she is having one of her own, she is met with the same doubts even though it is a genuine fear. The sense of hopelessness grows throughout the movie as hope drains from our lead actress.

Speaking of our lead actress, Sosie Bacon is fantastic in this movie. She carries every single scene she is in, which is just about every one. Her minor facial movements and eye expressions were so sad and realistic to that of someone experiencing trauma. I loved everything about her performance and will be excited to see her moving forward. The other performances were average across the board, but they didn't really have a lot to work with and filled their roles well. Jessie Usher felt a little out of place though, I feel like he did the nice and charismatic husband role well but when he had to display genuine fear and anger he overacted quite a bit.

Finally, I wanted to touch on the ending. I am not going to spoil anything for the audience, but this is exactly what I wanted throughout the entire film. I kept asking myself, are they going to do it? But second guessed myself and when the payoff happened, I left the theater with a big Smile on my face.

CinemaSerf,5.0,"""Dr. Rose Cotter"" (Sosie Bacon) is a dedicated clinical psychologist who witnesses the gruesome suicide of a young woman in her hospital consulting room. Traumatised, as you might expect, she gradually starts to suffer from unexpected goings on in her own life. Her relationship becomes unstable and soon she appears to have but a tenuous grasp on reality herself. What's going on? Is she doomed to a similar fate? This has something of the ""Azazel"" theory to it, and as the story develops director Parker Finn manages to build quite a degree of mystery and suspense. The malevolence of her haunting spirit is well captured by those working the audio - the sound effects and the score contribute well to the overall feel of this film. The acting though, well I am sorry - I found that to be a terrible let down. Initially, Bacon owned the film but after a few moments she just hadn't the weight to carry the thing in what is, essentially, a one-hander. Her support comes mainly for her ex-boyfriend/cop and all round sceptic about the whole thing ""Joel"" (Kyle Gallner) after her boyfriend ""Trevor"" (Jessie T. Usher) and her own erstwhile psychiatrist played by an indifferent Robin Weigert give up the ghost with her. Sadly, they offer little to add depth to this rather superficial horror effort. There are jump moments, but they lose their potency as this actor fails to capitalise on the tensions being created around her. Perhaps had the story spent less time on her character development, and the pace been tightened up a bit then we might have had less time to worry about that; but the style of the photography with too many lingering images merely serves to sterilise the whole thing for me. I was really disappointed, and after a while just wanted to go watch ""Fallen"" (1998) instead.",2022-10-21T08:53:57.843Z,882598,2 stars,0.4560682773590088

Sound design generates an immersive atmosphere rarely seen in horror films, but it turns out to be the moving, character-driven narrative that truly captivates viewers.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,5.0,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

What bugs me the most about “The Greatest Beer Run Ever” is director Peter Farrelly’s indecisiveness. He can’t seem to pick a tone and stick with it. The first part is filled with lighthearted moments that make it seem like the film is a tailor-made crowd-pleasing movie. The last half of the film (and the strongest) is firm in its anti-war messaging. Farrelly tries to be too many things to too many people, and the result is a film that feels at odds with itself.

Set in 1967, the film tells the true story of Chickie Donohue (Zac Efron), a man who wants to do something special to show his support for his neighborhood friends serving in Vietnam. He gets the outrageous idea to hand-deliver cans of beer to them on the front lines so they can have a little taste of home, and to show them that somebody back in New York still cares. When the locals start to encourage (and count on) Chickie to complete his mission, the man sets off for the jungles of Vietnam with a rucksack full of Pabst Blue Ribbon.

It’s a terrific story that should make a great film. The problem is that there isn’t much to the movie other than the premise. Some of the situations Chickie finds himself in are ridiculous, and there’s no complexity to the story at all. It’s as straightforward as they come, in what I can only presume was a conscious effort by Farrelly to keep it easily accessible for mainstream audiences.

The film briefly touches on the political and social impacts of the Vietnam War, including the division between Chickie’s family and friends. The film gets better once he heads back to Saigon and the story settles into its strong anti-war stance. It’s heavy-handed in its “war is hell” messaging, and it’s where the film gets away from its actors.

Efron is fine as the film’s leading man, but the role requires a depth that seems to be a bit too much of a stretch for him at this point in his career. He’s talented, but is asked to do more than he’s comfortably capable. Bill Murray is a high point of the film, although he only makes a very brief appearance as the neighborhood barkeep. The best work comes from Russell Crowe as a photojournalist.

There are some memorable scenes in “The Greatest Beer Run Ever,” but they will be soon forgotten under the weight of the film’s boilerplate script. Just because the movie is based on an interesting true story doesn’t automatically make it a winner.",2023-04-23T06:39:24.107Z,597922,3 stars,0.3604985773563385

Peter McGinn,7.0,"I don’t watch thrillers as a rule, so I will not try to compare it to others in that genre. I gave this a try only because of Allison Janney, who first impressed me in West Wing and later in Mom. Of course, this is a different breed of character for her altogether.

In a few ways the movie stuck close to the formula of the restrictive thriller genre: the supervillain who is always one step ahead until near the end, the fight scenes where any one blow would knock out a real person, scenes from the past filling in where character development leaves off, and plot twists I could see coming yards away. But the movie had a couple of surprises for me, the body count wasn’t as high as usual, and Janney put in her usual strong performance, so I stayed with it until the end, as did my wife, who enjoys thrillers even less than I do. So I guess that speaks volumes for Lou in the end.",2022-10-28T10:40:10.073Z,429473,3 stars,0.5063852071762085

Lou is a decent but forgettable action drama with a surprisingly good cast but a script that lets everyone down and characters that are just unbelievable. Lou is the Netflix version of Nobody without the humor or fight choreography. Lou is a former CIA operative in hiding that steps in to help her neighbors when a child is kidnapped. Bad guys get shot. Bad Guys get stabbed. Stuff gets blown up. All that should equal a good movie, and it almost does but doesn’t quite make it.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"So imagine the scenario. A boozy lunch with with some screenwriters who had just seen ""Vivarium"" (2019) and began to recall ""Stepford Wives"" (2004) and the ""Truman Show"" (1998). We know, say the assembled talent - let's write a pointless hybrid of these stories, making sure to avoid the best bits of any of them then get two gorgeous people to take part. We'll end up minted! Well they may well have ended up making loads of cash, but what they have provided for us is an heavily stylised story that goes nowhere fast. To be fair, Florence Pugh tries quite hard as ""Alice"", the increasingly disturbed wife of ""Jack"" (Harry Styles). They live in an Utopian desert community where the men all head to work for ""Frank"" (Chris Pine) in the morning and the women do the standard middle class housework, shopping and networking things. All is idyllic until ""Alice"" notices that one of their neighbours ""Margaret"" (KiKi Layne) is convinced that something is amiss amidst their perfect lifestyle. When an inexplicable tragedy ensues, ""Alice"" starts to have nightmares and soon her marriage and his career prospects are in jeopardy. Pine isn't the least menacing as the duplicitous ""Frank"" and though the camera really does love Styles, he has little here to demonstrate whether he can actually act or can just fill a perfectly tailored suit as well as Daniel Craig. That's really the problem here. The film looks good, but the plot is completely undercooked. We are delivered of a partially formed plot that is derivative and, frankly, rather dull. The last few scenes with the guys in red reminded me of a television commercial for Vodaphone and at just over two hours long, I was just unengaged with it all. Styles' looks will take him far and working with the likes of Pugh and Pine will only help him, but unless his people work harder on the scripts and characterisations, then he will just end up Zac Efron-light. This is a film for television in due course, I'd say.",2022-09-26T07:51:08.654Z,619730,2 stars,0.468239963054657
r96sk,9.0,"I thought this was great.

I only knew of the off-screen drama about <em>'Don’t Worry Darling'</em>, thankfully I hadn't read or seen anything at all about the plot - which, obviously, helped my enjoyment. As such, I was extremely interested in the first chunk of this. It builds up nicely, revealing details here and there. The ending isn't as strong but I still dig it, don't get me wrong.

The cast are terrific, even if Florence Pugh completely wipes the floor with her co-stars... and I don't mean that negatively on them one bit, it's simply a case of Pugh giving an outstanding performance. This is only the third film of her's that I've seen... gotta watch more!

Away from Pugh, I was impressed by Harry Styles. He can act. I will say, though, that Shia LaBeouf would've been greater in the role though. Elsewhere, Olivia Wilde (also dir.), Chris Pine and Gemma Chan do good things.

Is it a perfect film? Not at all. Is it entertaining? Sure is. Each to their own, but I thoroughly enjoyed this 2022 release.",2022-10-11T19:19:01.690Z,619730,4 stars,0.6875304579734802
Nathan,7.0,"It is no surprise that _Don't Worry Darling_ has been marred with public controversies and poor critic reception, but is it really bad as the media would want you to believe? While I admit, there are plenty of issues in the story department, like completely abandoning certain plot details as they are introduced or leaving certain character plots half-baked to name a few, the other aspects of this film really make this an enjoyable viewing experience.

Olivia Wilde's direction is actually really well done here. I could tell that certain shots and elements were done with the specific intent to create a romanticized version of the 1950's while still giving glimpses of something sinister hidden underneath. Although it is a shame that these elements didn't lead to much in terms of a reveal at the end.

The acting is a mixed bag here. Florence Pugh and Chris Pine absolutely carry this film. Pugh carries such complex emotions and is able to show her internal struggles while putting on a pretty face for appearance sakes. It is captivating and the audience can completely be resonant with her, this connection makes her character easy to root for. Chris Pine was really sinister in this role. I have not seen him as a villain in many shows and he does a fantastic job. For whatever reason, his mannerisms really reminded me of James Spader in Avengers: Age of Ultron, and that is a complement. Pine was not giving much screen time or character development, but he does the most with what he has. Olivia Wildes was fine, do not really have any complaints really, wasn't great but wasn't bad. Harry Styles' performance is hard to pinpoint. While I don’t think he did bad, but when he is constantly sharing the screen with Pughe, he is overshadowed a lot and his deficiencies show much more.

Overall, I was disappointed with _Don't Worry Darling_ and the potential that was there to be such a special film. But it was still a good film that I had a fun time in.

""Personally, I believe that cinematic narratives with multiple plot points and questions related to the world itself are too often confused and envisioned as character studies driven by a single protagonist.

Both Olivia Wilde and David Cronenberg complete their movies when the main character fulfills the minimum requirements of their arc, consequently renouncing all other equally significant issues worthy of in-depth exploration. In the case of Don't Worry Darling, one finishes it with an underwhelming feeling from an unsurprising conclusion, while in Crimes of the Future, viewers are left with several questions and interesting, half-developed paths about such a mesmerizing futuristic world.

Neither film explores its own world-building satisfactorily.""

Don't Worry Darling is a new take on The Stepford Wives. Same basic story with some fantastic cinematography, great costuming, beautiful visuals, and committed, top-notch performances from the cast. But all that is lost in a script that gets stuck on coming up with as many ways as possible to show its characters' slipping sanity rather than telling a complete story. The plot twists were pretty easy to guess, and the finale ended abruptly without providing any conclusion or resolution for the character. With all the bright spots this film had to offer, the sloppy story squandered all its high points leaving me let down and a little bored even with an exciting climax. With that said, I'm still trying to figure out what could have been done to make this story more compelling.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,4.0,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

“Don’t Worry Darling” isn’t the massive mess that so many predicted, but it does suffer from a few major problems. The script (written by Katie Silberman) lacks grace and polish, one star’s questionable acting skills is amplified by the other lead’s performance, and Olivia Wilde‘s direction is noticeably weak. But there’s still something mesmerizing about this feminist-tinged film and its commentary on the supposed ideals of a patriarchal society.

Alice (Florence Pugh) and Jack (Harry Styles) live a charmed life in the experimental utopia known as Victory. The town is exclusively for employees of the top-secret Victory Project and their families, and it’s truly the most perfect place in the world — or so it seems. Company CEO Frank (Chris Pine) is the visionary behind it all, a stylish, confident leader whom the men all want to emulate. He provides everything the town’s residents need, asking only for loyalty and obedience in return.

Victory is a place that embodies the idyllic 1950s life, where the women cook and clean, dress to perfection, and spend their free time day drinking, lounging by the pool, and gossiping with friends. The men fulfill their role in this society too, by going to work at the mysterious headquarters and returning like clockwork in the evenings. It’s a don’t ask, don’t tell type of community, until Alice begins having strange, nightmarish visions. She begins to explore the more sinister side of Victory, hoping to eventually expose what’s really going on beneath the facade of domestic bliss.

The plot is one that’s been done before, and there isn’t much by way of originality. What makes the first part of the film so successful is that the story is told from the point of view of the women in town. By presenting the narrative through the lens of an army of happy homemaker wives, there’s an ominous tone throughout — especially when the ladies in town turn to self-harm in order to take back control of their lives.

Alice is a strong female character, and Pugh proves yet again that she’s one of the most exciting talents working in Hollywood today. Much is asked of her and she is up to the task of doing the heavy lifting here, especially in her many scenes with Styles. To put it bluntly, Pugh acts Styles under the table and then some. I believe the film would have been more successful with a more talented leading man.
When the ending finally comes through a long drawn out reveal, it’s a letdown that feels like an episode of “Black Mirror.” If you examine some of the film’s earlier scenes, the story doesn’t feel quite as airtight as it should.

The themes are excessive and overdone, presenting the conservative male ideal of relationships and life. It’s a chilling statement about women’s rights and responsibilities, and men’s desire to control and dominate. The timing for this message couldn’t be more perfect with the tumultuous political climate that’s spreading around the world. As a woman, I appreciate the sentiment of “Don’t Worry Darling” and the feminist lens in which its presented, but I just wish the film had been more successful overall.",2023-04-23T06:35:11.579Z,619730,3 stars,0.5349852442741394
CinemaSerf,6.0,"I did quite enjoy this, but it's far too long and I found that the funniest bits had all already been seen in the trails! Initially, it centres around the fairly tempestuous relationship between models ""Carl"" (Harris Dickinson) and ""Yaya"" (Charlbi Dean). The latter is an influencer who looks at their relationship as something more transient; he is much more besotted - and so vows to make her fall in enduring love with him. Off onto a luxury yacht they head for an holiday with a few millionaires run by the super-officious ""Paula"" (Vicki Berlin) and captained by the dipsomaniac Woody Harrelson. The two befriend the lively and charismatic Russian oligarch ""Dimitry"" (Zlatlo Buric) and his wife ""Vera"" (Sunnyi Melles) before a captain's dinner that the choppy seas ensure ends in a messy and entertaining disaster! The remainder of their adventure has something of the ""Admirable Crichton"" to it, as they must adapt to the command of their erstwhile toilet cleaner ""Abigail"" (Dolly De Leon) who exacts her own unique sort of fees from her erstwhile patrons in return for catching fish and lighting fires... It does take a ping at the vacuousness of the modelling industry and at the unscrupulousness of big business - best exemplified in one scene with Oliver Ford Davies and Amanda Walker as the demure Brits who made their fortune selling ""the greatest single contribution to democracy"" (hand grenades!). Sadly, though, the moments of humour are relatively short and sweet when put into the context of this lengthy and frequently rather dull enterprise. Dickinson looks great shirtless, but as an actor he has limitations and I didn't really feel much chemistry between him and, well, anyone else. The last half hour could have been better, funnier, had there been a slight sense of menace - but somehow I just knew that the ending was going to deliver they way it does. Buric adds value, as does Henrik Dorsin's gazillionaire ""Jarmo"" but by half way through the joke had worn too thin to sustain it and I was a little bored. Doesn't need a big screen, and co-produced by the BBC I expect it can wait for Christmas television for most of us.",2022-11-03T08:30:07.553Z,497828,3 stars,0.5995706915855408
jw,5.0,"sketched, never completed

Looks like the director/writer had some notes, and didn't get around to write a complete script. So the movie starts out very promising, but then gradually runs out of ideas, until the last half is just ticking off the boxes of expected items.

The quirky, funny look into modelling is followed by a well cast and (in some moments) acted part about relationship issues between inexperienced, clueless, and selfish people. 
We learn that the naïve male model is actually in love, while his female model/influencer counterpart tells him he's nice entertainment until she finds a rich guy to be trophy wife for. This doesn't deter him... and that was the promising bit. 

Next, they are on a luxury yacht for the decadents; and there is still potential for a really good story: the upstairs/downstairs angle is only implemented in a few scenes, most screen time of this part is spent on lavish dining with icky ""haute cuisine"" food in rough seas, and the consequences thereof.

That was when the really good part could've started: how to they meet or avoid gazes the next day, the day after? What has changed, how, what shouldn't and how do class barriers break?

Instead, we get a clownish intermezzo and next, the boring island section. This part is just tedious agitprop, reducing the (already shallow) characters to templates, and doing all the expected bits. Waste of time, talent, and a nice beach.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,9.0,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**


Writer / director Ruben Östlund‘s wickedly sharp black comedy “Triangle of Sadness” offers a biting satire of everything from gender roles, capitalist society, corruption of power, modern masculinity, and the social hierarchies that result from a system that encourages class division. The film has a lot to say and does it well, wading through layers of stinging dialogue, sophisticated observations, and lots and lots of vomit.

The film is a lot more than its now-infamous fifteen minute puking scene, however. It’s an in-your-face story that doesn’t shy away from confronting everything from the rampant abuse of the less privileged to the primitive savagery of human nature.

Instagram influencers and celebrity model couple Carl (Harris Dickinson) and Yaya (Charlbi Dean) are invited on an all-expenses-paid vacation on a luxury cruise in exchange for expert promotion on social media. The ritzy yacht is frequented by ultra-rich passengers who demand the finest things in life (one of the early scenes features a helicopter air-dropping a couple of jars of Nutella in the ocean, which is hilarious because it’s so ridiculous).

As Carl and Yaya settle in, they begin to meet their very wealthy fellow guests, including a couple of British arms dealers, a Russian oligarch (Zlatko Buric), and an unhinged Marxist boat captain (Woody Harrelson) who spends the majority of the cruise drunk and locked in his cabin. If not a recipe for disaster, it certainly sets the stage for an interesting few days at sea. But after the ship encounters a vicious storm and capsizes, the handful of survivors are left stranded on a deserted island and fighting for survival.

The film has a lot to say about feminism, sexism, today’s social-media obsessed society, the gross exploitation of the working class, the conflicts between the haves and have-nots, the shallowness of the fashion industry, and lots more.

While it would’ve been the easier route to demonize the billionaires in his story, Östlund instead chooses to make them appropriately ostentatious yet still kind of likeable. They’re not entirely jackasses, they’re just mega-wealthy. Setting the film on a cruise ship is brilliant too, as they have a built-in class system between passengers and amongst the crew. The boat symbolizes the hierarchy of social classes, including the officers, the predominantly white “face time” staff, and the lower rungs that include the cooks, engineers, janitorial workers, and other people of color. It’s satisfying to watch the pecking order not only completely dissolve but get turned upside down after the yacht sinks. That’s when the working class takes over, because they’re the ones who know how to get stuff done.

The film offers shrewd observations and a critique of class and privilege, culminating in a third act that delivers a bountiful amount of schadenfreude. The best is the story of “toilet worker” Abigal (Dolly De Leon, who gives the film’s standout performance), a woman who quickly takes command on the deserted island because she is the only person with any sort of survival skills. After starting a fire, catching fish, and handling the distribution of the small amount of supplies left on the lifeboat, she demands that everyone refer to her as “Captain.” She even begins trading food for sexual favors with Carl.

Östlund’s film about a cruise from hell is an achievement in satire that effortlessly skewers many timely subjects. He sets his eyes squarely on deserved targets and dismantles them with wit and sophistication, making “Triangle of Sadness” one of the smartest and most interesting films of the year.",2023-04-23T06:25:52.040Z,497828,3 stars,0.5488408207893372

It is unquestionable that the main question people will ask is, does it live up to X? While I do think it is a good film that I thoroughly enjoyed, it does not overtake its predecessor and that is completely okay. They are two entirely different movies but achieve their goals brilliantly.

This film is the textbook definition of a slow burn. The movie drags on and continues to provide this eerie tension as the viewer knows what the end result of this tragic film will be, but still remains locked in to see how it will unfold. I really enjoyed the first act, the character introductions were fantastic, and the audience has an instant connection with Pearl. But the second act drags a little more than I would have liked, but by the minute it is getting stale the third comes to pick up the pace and deliver a satisfying conclusion.

Mia Goth is utterly fantastic in this film. There is a solid six-minute monologue of just her acting her ass off. One take, one angle, and somehow, she was able to lock me in completely. She has burst on to the scene with X and Pearl, and I cannot wait to see where her career goes from here.

On one of her occasional visits to town to collect her father's laudanum, she encounters the local projectionist (David Corenswet) who shows her a (quite racy) film and suggests that maybe a new life could be her's. Meantime, her life at the farm is becoming unbearable and her options for escape lead her to realise that drastic action may be needed - a plan that is accidentally put into play after an altercation with her mother. It's perfectly watchable, this, but it's also perfectly forgettable. The story is weak and thin, and though the photography is attractive, the whole thing just doesn't catch fire for me. There's no menace. It's not an horror film - it's a film about a mentally ill girl that offers us a few mildly entertaining scenarios that peter out as quickly as the plot does before an ending that screams sequel loudly and defiantly.

The strange and unusual “Pearl,” a prequel to writer / director Ti West‘s “X”, is a different kind of slasher film. Creating an origin story for the title villain, the film tells the history of a farm girl dreamer with a serious mean streak. It’s a horror movie that’s unlike any other, a candy-colored, nightmarish dream world of lofty ambitions, brutal violence, and bloody murder.

Pearl (Mia Goth) is trapped on her family’s isolated farm. She dutifully performs her barn chores and tends to her ailing, wheelchair-bound father (Matthew Sunderland), all under the stern eye of her overbearing mother (Tandi Wright). Pearl wants nothing more in the world than to live the glamorous life of “the girls in the pictures” that she sees on the big screen at the movies. With her husband Howard off to fight World War I, Pearl finds her ambitions at odds with the reality of the life she’s been dealt. It’s clear something isn’t right with the young woman, and her violent tendencies begin to bubble to the surface.

Things weren’t great for women in 1918, and the world certainly wasn’t a place for a fiery feminist. The film is an intriguing character study of a thoroughly disturbed woman who is a victim of her own gender. Goth is asked to do the film’s heavy lifting, and she gives a wonderfully unhinged lead performance. She screams a lot but displays an impressive range, especially as she is thrust into episodes of psychopathic ire. Her calm demeanor is frightening, and almost as disturbing as her precise, unique kills. Using farm tools, Pearl becomes a skilled murderer as she gives herself over to her homicidal desires.

The story is simple but engaging, and West creates an old-timey mood with a vintage score that fits the tone beautifully. The Technicolor aesthetic harkens back to Hollywood’s Golden Age, a time of traditional glitz and glamour. It’s a great looking film that feels fresh and different, and West directs with an assured eye. His long, unbroken takes are showy but executed with purpose, and the film features a powerful monologue that’s unforgettable.

One of my favorite parts about the movie is the chilling ending, an extended scene of a true demented breakdown that still haunts me. There’s so much that makes this film so memorable, and “Pearl” is a special kind of horror film with a refreshing style and killer instinct.",2023-04-23T06:25:34.989Z,949423,4 stars,0.43876203894615173
tmdb51616167,1.0,"I will be doing a combined review for the two films, ""X"" and ""Pearl.""

Upon seeing the high ratings given by both the general public and critics to these movies, I am left puzzled about what truly makes a good film.

Let's start with ""X,"" a movie that I found to be absolutely terrible. The film revolves around pornography rather than a cohesive storyline, resulting in a disjointed and atrocious viewing experience. The cinematography, acting, storytelling, and writing were all subpar, yet critics inexplicably praised it.

The attempt to elevate the film with Jenna Ortega fell short, as she had minimal screen time amidst excessive male and adult nudity, making it unsuitable for general viewing. This is a movie best watched in private, not recommended by me at all.

Moving on to ""Pearl,"" I was equally disappointed as it also relied heavily on sexual themes. The film took a bizarre turn, culminating in a scene that made me walk out of the theater in disbelief.

It's baffling to see these films receive acclaim, especially when performances like Mia Goth's are lacking. It seems that the current focus is on titillation rather than genuine storytelling.

As we await the verdict on the third film, it appears that the world may be more interested in gratification than meaningful narratives.",2024-09-02T18:58:58.979Z,949423,2 stars,0.5822442173957825
RalphRahal,7.0,"Pearl (2022) is a visually striking psychological horror film that takes a unique approach to storytelling. Set in the 1920s, the movie immediately stands out with its vibrant, almost dreamlike cinematography that contrasts with its dark themes. The production design is meticulous, capturing the era’s aesthetic with rich colors and a polished, old-Hollywood feel. While the plot starts off slow, especially in the first act and early second, it gradually picks up, pulling you deeper into the protagonist's unsettling world. Ti West's direction is methodical, letting tension simmer rather than relying on cheap scares, which works well for the film's psychological depth.

Mia Goth carries the entire movie with an outstanding performance, making Pearl one of the most compelling horror characters in recent years. Her ability to shift between innocence and madness is captivating, and she brings an emotional weight that elevates the script. The dialogue feels natural yet eerie, adding to the film’s unease. The score is another highlight, blending classic orchestral sounds with unsettling undertones that perfectly match the film’s descent into darkness. While it may not be as fast-paced as some horror films, Pearl delivers a slow-burn psychological experience that lingers long after the credits roll.",2025-02-16T21:36:06.705Z,949423,4 stars,0.6290203332901001

However, it’s been cosmetically redesigned into something so misshapen, hideous, and unrecognizable that it’s a shell of its former shelf.

Ahmetaslan27,5.0,"It is a remake of the Austrian movie of the same name, directed in 2014. The story of the movie is about two brothers who arrive at their mother's house, but they suspect that there is something strange in their mother's behavior.

The Austrian version is of course better, but what distinguishes this version is that it has a plot in the scenario.

 If you have not watched the Austrian version, you will like this version
What the director excelled at at the beginning of the film was that I did not doubt for a moment that one of the two brothers had died and that only the mother was seeing one of her sons, who was alive. 

The director tried as much as possible to mislead the viewer, but unfortunately, he did not succeed.

The acting performance of the two brothers was okay, but the directing did not control the matter in an attempt to deceive the viewer until the end.

The atmosphere of the film was dark to create a satisfactory atmosphere in the house because the mother is sick and wears a mask, but the dream scenes with reality were not mixed correctly and in a clever way.

This movie was a simplified version and expresses that the lazy director could have done more to make the movie better.",2023-03-17T04:31:43.758Z,814800,3 stars,0.5232520699501038
Nathan,7.0,"The Woman King is a touching film that balances the dramatic tone with high octane action delivering a compelling experience. With a powerhouse cast, there is plenty of fantastic performances throughout the entire film. Lashana Lynch was brilliant in this film, she presents herself with a hard exterior but is able to touch into her more emotional and caring self her relationship with Thuso Mbedu's character. Their chemistry was great and one of my favorite parts about the film. 

The action in this film was really well done. The choreography was great, and the scope was vast. I loved how multiple shot led into each other. Although, part of me wish this had been rated R so that the fight scenes could have the blood and gore that this movie was wanting to deliver so desperately. I really feel like they had to cut even greater combat moves due to keeping the PG-13 rating. But even with that limited scope, that action delivers.

There are some pacing issues, with the middle section of the movie dragging on a little too much for my tastes. The ending ramps everything back up again and delivers a great resolution that concludes the film wonderfully.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Viola Davis offers us a compelling and emotional performance as the general of the highly trained and deadly, all-woman, bodyguard of the King of Dahomey (John Boyega). Increasingly embroiled in the ambitions of the European slavers and, to a certain extent, complicit in that trade themselves, the Agojie must face encroaching and modernly armed soldiers of the Oyo empire. On a personal level, this great warrior clearly has demons of her own and as she is introduced to the headstrong and courageous ""Nawi"" (Thuso Mbedu) she sees more of herself than she anticipated. When serendipity now plays it's hand the hitherto unshakable mettle of ""Nanisca"" faces an whole new series of perilous and personal challenges. The cinematography is beautiful, as is the whole look of the film in general. The political and social elements of the narrative are there to be seen but any comments made about them are levelled gently and at both sides who indulge, permit, and/or profit by the activities that made many very wealthy. The action scenes, the ensemble dancing, the singing - all are excellently presented in a colourful and plausible fashion; illustrating the sophistication of this legendary African nation and the shameless brutality of those who would be the exploiters. Lashana Lynch contributes well too, as the personable and feisty ""Izogie"" as do Sheila Atim (""Amenza"") and Sivuyile Ngesi as the nemesis general ""Migan"". Annoyingly, I could not quite place the ""Santo"" actor until I realised it was none-other than the star of the truly mediocre ""After"" films - Hero Fiennes Tiffin - and he adds very little. It really benefits from the big screen experience, if you can - and is well worth a watch.",2022-10-20T13:43:58.953Z,724495,4 stars,0.6276052594184875

Viola Davis crushes brutal action heroine! The entire cast was powerful, vicious, strong, and exciting. The action explodes right out the gate and feels so raw, with the jujitsu, Kali, and Chinese Wushu all blending with the machete and spear fighting to feel like the sword version of John Wick's gun-fu. Viola Davis' steely strong portrayal of Nanisca delivers a mighty yet caring warrior general, creating the genuine and dynamic atmosphere of the film. The entire cast gave stellar performances, but the stand out was Lashana Lynch as Izogie. Lynch was as over-powering, unstoppable, and skilled as any warrior in the film while also serving as the heart, humor, and strength of her Agojie sisters. The film was a fantastic adventure epic but lagged a little in the middle as it focused solely on character development and exposition. Yes, I know I'm complaining about character development, but it was just solid discussion and characters without much to keep me engaged for that hour-long middle section. But that is nitpicking.

Peter McGinn,6.0,"I liked The Woman King okay: the scenery and acting were fine and the music glorious, but why did I sometimes feel I was watching a different “King” movie by Disney? They danced as well as they fought; though to be fair, is it much different than the complex marches used by more modern armies? There was a bit too much violence for my taste, but perhaps it is needed for the target audience.

The story was stereotypical in places, though for this progressive white guy, it was refreshing not to see white faces shoehorned into the story to placate the (only) White Lives Matter crowd, who were out in force with negative reviews. Here is a tip: if a four-star review points out positives but throws in complaints about historical accuracy and not enough Caucasians for the movies’ setting— okay, maybe. But if a one-star review screams about the issue, welcome to the Keep Movies White World. Are they just as offended by the thousands of movies that ignored or appropriated stories and roles of people of color in all white movies though the decades? I think not.

So while this movie won’t make any of my lists of favorites, I am glad it was made available to women and girls and other less-thin skinned caucasians like me to enjoy.",2022-11-11T11:53:00.488Z,724495,3 stars,0.5197705626487732

... but then again, it was a melodramatic propaganda piece from start to finish...

... but that's not why it's one of the movies with a huge disparancy between critic and user reviews on the more reputable sights.  It was intentionally polarizing.  Rational people are ripping into it because they turned a power hungry monster responsible for the slave trade and a fair amount of ethnic cleansing into an anti-slavery hero.  It was a monumental rewrite of history from start to finish, one so extreme you can't even give it the excuse of artistic license. 

And it was intentional, there were a lot of other people that you could make a heroic movie about that fit the mold they were looking for to push meh message.  But they chose this one because the point wasn't to praise the historical figure, the point was to praise the total rewrite of history.

And make no mistake, that is the reason for the positive reviews.  They don't care that it's a cheap poorly written over-acted political propaganda flick, they are praising the fact that they blatantly and knowingly rewrote history, and then turned around and said ""we don't care, it's rewritten now, we have changed reality and, guess what, all of our goose stepping followers don't care either.""",2023-04-09T22:05:30.530Z,724495,2 stars,0.4435587525367737
CinemaSerf,6.0,"What a truly disappointing film this is. It offers us a really slow, sterile and disjointed - almost episodic - depiction of just how Marilyn Monroe's life might have panned out. For a start, I couldn't decide whether Ana de Armas was really Lady Gaga or Scarlett Johansson (both of whom would have acquitted themselves better, I'd say) as she offers an admittedly intense, but remarkably uninvolved performance. We move along from chapter to chapter in her life hindered by some fairly weak and uninspiring dialogue and seriously intrusive scoring in what becomes an increasingly shallow and lacklustre fashion. The photography does try hard - it does offer us a sense of intimacy, but the whole thing is presented in such a stylised and un-natural manner that it is frequently difficult to tell whether she is/was a ""real"" woman. Her marriages are treated in an almost scant manner - and her relationship with JFK is reduced to something rather implausibly one-sided and sordid showing nothing of how their relationship might have come to be. It has no soul, this film. Aside from her glamour - which was, even then, hardly unique we are not really introduced to any of the nuances of her character, we are left guessing a lot of the time as to just how she did become such a superstar, and how she spiralled so inevitably into a maelstrom of booze and pills. It relies to a considerable extent on the viewer's existing knowledge of, and affection for, this flawed lady. Adrien Brody and Bobby Cannavale don't really have much chance to add anything as her husbands and the highly speculative relationship between her and Charlie Chaplin Jnr (Xavier Samuel) and his sexually ambiguous partner-in-crime Edward G Robinson Jr (Scoot McNairy) does suggest something of the rather profligate and debauched existence that some lived in Hollywood, but again their characters are also largely undercooked and again, we are largely left to use our own imagination. It is far, far too long and in a packed cinema, I could see people looking at the ceiling just once too often. Watchable, certainly, but a real missed opportunity to offer us something scintillating and tantalising about this most of iconic of women.",2022-09-24T10:53:16.700Z,301502,2 stars,0.6414687633514404
Martín Acosta,4.0,"In the middle of 2022, the movie I was looking forward to the most was '**Blonde**', but... I'm really disappointed.

The film has nowhere to hold on, it's just a fictional compilation of the supposed life of **Marilyn Monroe**, where we don't get context and it's easy to get lost through the scenes and the large number of characters (_which if you didn't know the story, you wouldn't really know who they are_) of a feature film of almost three hours. The direction is good, although quite experimental where sometimes elements that seem to come out of nowhere are combined. Not to mention the constant switching between color and black/white that doesn't seem to represent anything concrete.

**Ana de Armas's** performance is brilliant, by far the best of the film, despite how poor her character is.

I'm really disappointed, in these times we live in, designing a movie about **Marilyn Monroe** could have contained a much more powerful message. The story of a woman who went through the sexualization of the industry in the 50's. Instead the film only seems to add fuel to the fire by showing nudity at any time and sometimes for no reason.

Based on a story in parts fictitious, with a vision, in my opinion, poorly focused, they make 'Blonde' a great disappointment.",2022-10-02T22:22:01.398Z,301502,2 stars,0.6394697427749634

I'm not fully convinced why, admittedly. I think it's just really interesting to watch from start-to-finish, the acting is very good and the film is put together well. I wasn't sure about having Ana de Armas as Marilyn Monroe during the first few scenes, though I quickly lost those thoughts as she gives a great performance.

I get the criticisms (though how many biopics truly stick to reality?) but I predominantly judge films as films, and this is a very watchable one in my books.

The story largely overlooks the factors that made the original film, so compellingly chilling. The slowly building tension, the gradual realisation that the pursuer is something worse than a garden house variety serial killer. In other words, the film ""creeps"" up on you. 

This film plays more like a run of the mill slasher flick, without the jump scares. The results not frightening or even a little chilling. 

I'd describe everything else as ""alright"", from acting, sets through to

Wuchak,7.0,"**_Some missed opportunities, but it’s not THAT bad_**

A young couple travel to a horror festival in the area of Louisiana that’s infamous for the legendary Creeper. When the actual creature awakens, all hell breaks loose.

The Jeepers Creepers Intellectual Property (IP) had basically been 'cancelled' due to the sexual crimes of the mastermind of the franchise, which paved the way for this reboot, ""Jeepers Creepers: Reborn"" (2022). It was made by a small studio in England trying to make a quick buck off the IP. This resulted in the production company of the two previous installments filing a property fraud lawsuit.

The best thing about the franchise is the Creeper, which is reminiscent of the chief gargoyle in ""Gargoyles"" (1972), just mixed with Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger. While people praise the first movie from 2001, it was hindered by its limited cast and Gina Philips was only serviceable on the feminine front. The second one from 2003 tried to make up for it with a whole busload of kids (plus three school employees), but it generally dropped the ball in the female department and, worse, focused a little too much on shirtless jocks, which can be explained by the writer/director's issues (get real). There was also zero depth beyond an evil winged creature attacking a busload of youths.

The third film from 2017 was hampered by an unnecessarily convoluted opening and the Creeper now had an eye-rolling 'Mystery Machine' with built-in weapons and defenses. The latter took away from the sense of genuine horror, but it provided the opportunity for some slasher thrills. In addition, Gabrielle Haugh was the best heroine up to that point.

So, here we are with this fourth installment, which is almost universally reviled. I agree that the story could be more compelling and the flick relies too much on CGI, but it has several highlights: Sydney Craven is easily the top heroine so far; there’s exposition on the demonic creature being reborn as a little Creeper; the Horror Hound Festival is a great milieu in the second act; the idea of occultic people worshipping the creature, as well as supplying victims, is interesting; and the story basically ends up being a cabin-in-the-woods flick.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t take full advantage of its positives. Sydney Craven could’ve been utilized even better (not tawkin’ ’bout nudity or sleaze) and the horror festival setting could’ve been milked for more entertainment. Still, there’s enough good here to make it my favorite of the tetralogy.  

It runs 1 hour, 28 minutes, and was shot at Black Hangar Studios in Lasham, which is a little over an hour’s drive southwest of London.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Sam Rockwell and Saoirse Ronan gel really well together in this rather entertaining spoof of all thing Agatha Christie. The latter is the newbie constable ""Stalker"" - an enthusiastic young woman who is saddled on the experienced, gin-loving, inspector ""Stoppard"" when the pretty unlikeable film director ""Köpernick"" (Adrien Brody) is beaten to death with a sewing machine! It turns out that he had just been engaged to direct a big screen version of the legendary ""Mousetrap"" play that had just celebrated it's hundredth performance at London's Ambassador's Theatre. What now ensues is a really engaging whodunit with flashbacks galore as the two police officers have to learn to trust each other as well as to handle the high drama amongst a cast of thespians, an avaricious producer and, of course, a publicity seeking police Commissioner. Rockwell delivers strongly as the rather laconic and disillusioned officer (he reminded me a little of Johnny Depp's ""Abberline"" in ""From Hell"" from back in 2001) and Ronan brings plenty of amusement (and courage) to her role as his aspirational sidekick who is always jumping to conclusions. As ever with Christie stories, you just know that the perpetrator of the crime is going to be the least important character so there's not oodles of jeopardy here, but it ends well with all assembled in a creaking stately home where it all ultimately falls to the author - ""Moaning Myrtle"" herself - to solve her own mystery. Tom George has assembled a decent supporting cast with both Harris Dickinson quite effective as a rather effete Richard Attenborough and Ruth Wilson as the shrewd theatre producer ""Petula"" and they help to deliver a pace and humour that is enjoyably amiable for just over ninety minutes. I've sat in the Ivy restaurant opposite this theatre for many a year but have never actually seen the play. A bit like with this film, you mustn't disclose the ending or maybe you'll be next...

Initially, I expected to see a historical account of Al Yankovic's life, a sort of biography revealing the truth behind the artist. However, as the film progressed and introduced bizarre characters and wild party scenes, I began to question its credibility.

Then, the portrayal of Madonna as a drug addict who used Al Yankovic for his pies, leading to a series of events involving murder and his own demise, completely threw me off. This unrealistic ending clashed with the fact that Al Yankovic is very much alive at 64 years old, having won multiple Grammys since.

Nathan,9.0,"_Barbarian_ is such a twisted and incredibly unique film. Going into this film, I thought I had a pretty good indication of how this was going to go down and was ready for a fun cheesy horror film that follow a pretty generic pattern, but boy was I wrong. Almost the entirety of the trailer was just the first act, and it left me seriously stumped at where this movie was going.
That sense of unknown really added to the thick tension that this movie brought throughout. There is a paranoia that occurs with both the audience and the main character. You never know who to trust, even if they give you all the indications that they are trustworthy.

In today's horror cinema, it is rare to see a movie so reliant on building tension rather than just jump scares galore. Not to say that this film does not have any jump scares, but they are there to enhance and bring a crescendo to the long scenes of tension and dread.

Overall, the acting was brilliant. Georgina Campbell was fantastic. Bill Skarsgård was a bit awkward at times, but I do think that was by choice, as his actor was a kind awkward sweetheart. Justin Long stole the show. His character added a bit of lightness and someone who the audience can really root against.
The movie does slightly fall of the rails in the third act, it does not take away from the experience that is Barbarian. In fact, I think it almost enhances the film as something truly unique.

MovieGuys,4.0,"I like Justin Long, he was fantastic in Jeepers Creepers but Barbarian is uninspiring, to say the least. Not that that is the fault of the actors.

Without giving too much away, Barbarian feels a little like The Hills Have Eyes, meets Psycho, meets Quasimodo. The problem here is the scripting and handling. Its takes far too long for this story to get off the ground, it has weird, nonsensical plot holes and the reveal comes far to early. 

Whats left almost feels like a second film. It leaves only a reiteration of the essential earlier plot line with a few wrinkles, as the film moves towards its rather icky, conclusion.

Of course, any sense of fear and tension, built up subtly in the first part of the film, is dissipated too. You know what's coming.

In summary, this film feels like it borrows from other horror flicks, in the worst possible way, leading to a disjointed but predictable viewing experience that's neither all that scary or even terribly interesting. The only thing propping it up, is the acting, which is of a high standard. Yet, as I've said more times than I can count, that on its own, is not enough.",2022-10-26T00:26:56.139Z,913290,2 stars,0.671595573425293
The Movie Mob,6.0,"**While for many horror fans, Barbarian might be compelling and unique, I found it decent but more strange and uncomfortable than scary and not as remarkable as others seem to think.**

Barbarian had heavy hype and big expectations before I checked it out. And while it didn’t blow my mind, I can see why many film aficionados would rate it more highly. It had a fresh Jordan Peele-type feel to a story that has been done many times before. I enjoyed the different stories coming together and the obvious nods to tropes of people ignoring clearly dangerous situations and red flags. However, while it had some fun elements, I wasn’t as impressed as many reviews suggested I should be. Definitely not a bad movie by any means, but some of the horror is just strange, and the creature is so bizarre that it’s less scary and more awkward at times.",2022-10-27T21:53:56.875Z,913290,3 stars,0.6811683177947998

""Barbarian deserves all the hype it received so far! Zach Cregger's unique storytelling in the horror film will leave any viewer baffled, transforming a generic premise into a truly captivating, suspenseful, thematically rich story where the definition of a ""good person"" is brilliantly explored.

It plays around with the audience's anticipation, especially with fans of the genre already used to the unfolding of formulaic arcs, through exciting twists and sudden tonal changes.

Georgina Campbell stands out from the rest, but all the players are important in embodying the idea that ""appearances can be deceiving"".

Mandatory viewing - go in blind.""

CinemaSerf,6.0,"When ""Tess"" (a rather prone to over-acting Georgina Campbell) arrives at her airb'n'b she discovers that it is already occupied by ""Keith"" (Bill Skarsgård). Both are meant to be there - some dodgy booking admin - and so after a bit of a shaky start, and a bottle of red, they agree to share for the night. Next morning, on the hunt for some toilet tissue, she encounters a secret room in the basement that looks like it's been used for nefarious purposes. When her new friend comes home, he goes exploring and next thing, we discover a network of tunnels inhabited by... To be fair to auteur Zach Cregger, there is quite an impactful degree of claustrophobic horror to this but I am afraid I wasn't convinced - right from the start - with the plausibility of the whole thing. Whom, in their right mind, would discover what she does and then go off exploring, on their own, without taking some fairly elementary precautions? The drama and peril here is sort of forced upon us despite any natural alarm bells we might have saying ""I don't think so"". Anyway, it turns out that ""AJ"" (Justin Long) owns the house and when he turns up to find it still bestrewn with their luggage, he joins in the hunt in the tunnels and the pace hots up a little as escape becomes the imperative against a foe who makes ""Gollum"" look like Claudia Schiffer. It is quite a watchable affair, I did quite enjoy it, but I struggled with the realism of the scenarios and maybe just because I'm a scaredy cat, I wasn't ever really persuaded! Fun, though - and certainly at the better end of the recent releases in this often underwhelming genre.",2022-11-03T08:45:29.217Z,913290,3 stars,0.5191619396209717

Niko,8.0,"Barbarian is a great horror movie, both in style and writing. It captures the viewer right from the beginning with a cinematography that manages to subtly portray the house as creepy in one scene and cozy in the next. The whole presentation is masterfully done and abruptly shifts multiple times throughout the story.

The actors, and Georgina Campbell in particular, are consistently great. This is one of those movies that manages to become scarier by ""tricking"" smart and in part relatable characters into helpless and intense situations instead of relying on slasher cliches. Barbarian really keeps you on your toes with unexpected twists and only the final quarter includes a number of regular horror movie tropes. 

Overall great writing, cast  and characters. The movie is scary, exciting, gross, disturbing and even a bit funny at times. I can highly recommended this to any fans of the genre.",2024-09-19T01:01:19.923Z,913290,4 stars,0.533383309841156
CinemaSerf,6.0,"There are certainly a few scenes at the start of this film (mostly those seen in the trailers) when there is a spark of chemistry between Julia Roberts (""Georgia"") and George Clooney (""David""). Formerly married, this couple have to dash to Bali when their twenty-five year old daughter ""Lily"" (Kaitlyn Dever) announces her intention to marry her Indonesian boyfriend of ten minutes ""Gede"" (Maxime Bouttier). Even on the flight over, it's clear that they cannot stand one and other, but they must ally and work together if they are to stop their lass's moment of madness. What happens now reminded me a little of ""Mamma Mia"" (2008) only without the ABBA songs and instead of Greece, we are in more Oriental surroundings. The photography is beautiful and ""Visit Bali"" must be hoping that tourists will flock to the gorgeous sandy beaches where you can readily farm seaweed and swim with some pretty brutal dolphins! The storyline here, though, is as predictable as one of the many sunsets we see as this decently paced lightweight comedy steers inevitably towards a conclusion that is never in doubt. Sadly it is the bitchy humour between Clooney and Roberts that holds this otherwise unremarkable film together, and as the story develops that is soon on the wain and we are left with a good looking but rather insubstantial movie. This raises a smile rather than a laugh, and slots neatly into the romcom category. It's a nice film, you probably won't hate it - but you won't ever remember it either.",2022-09-24T22:08:22.160Z,800939,3 stars,0.5439763069152832

The actors carried the entire film and were a joy to watch on screen. Julia Roberts and George Clooney's chemistry was top notch, they played incredibly off each other creating a genuine love story between the two leads. Their comedic timing was brilliant, every line delivered and had me audibly laughing more times than I can count. Kaitlyn Dever did okay in this film, she did not have a lot to work with and was constantly out shined by Billie Lourd who was hilarious. My fiancé and I were crying every time she was on screen.

jw,5.0,"Medieval? Mediocre.

There is a grand tale to be told about the historic Jan Žižka, his times and all that goes with it - the social, religious, political atmosphere, the power-play, the backstabbing, the wars.

And parts of this tale have been told well.

But not in this movie. It has good actors, wonderful locations, competent crew, and the biggest budget a Czech movie ever had so far - but it fails. The overall dramaturgy, the pacing, the direction and even the cut fail. This movie has many troubles, and the script is at the core of them.

The start is promising - it introduces us into the situation, where no-one is ""good""; Zizka and his mercenaries are for hire, and who is your enemy today can be your comrade tomorrow. The powerful keep changing sides, nothing is certain, except for the low-born will be suffering either way.

But where to go from here? There could have been a wild romp through many of the stations of Zizka's life. Or it could have been a character study, how Zizka came to be the Czech national hero he is. But the movie fails to do that, too - it also burdens us with an unnecessary (and most likely a-historical) love story, and draws out things for long, long, long.
The battles appear fierce, close up, bloody; if you don't look close, it gives the rough impression of good fighting scenes.

Too many cliches, too many wide-eyed pained looks from the good lady, and TOO MUCH TIME WASTED.

This bit could've been told in a quarter of the time, without skipping anything - and we'd get to see much more of the Czech history (plus more battles, intrigues, and if unavoidable, also love stories).

**TL;DR: A waste of talent, money, and time.** No need to waste yours, unless you have an lazy time to while away.

Conversely, the television series excel at breaking down complex elements, drawing viewers in with character development and engaging storylines that facilitate a deeper understanding of the Star Wars universe.

Series like The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett have been executed brilliantly, allowing audiences to connect with main and side characters on a more personal level. These shows have provided me with insights into characters like Luke and Leia, enhancing my comprehension of their backgrounds and motivations.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,1.0,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

For some reason (we all know it’s the money), Disney is determined to mine their vault for material to remake, update, or “reimagine.” The studio’s latest abomination is the live action and animated musical “Pinocchio,” a massive misfire that tarnishes the beloved 1940s classic. Director and co-writer Robert Zemeckis‘ film is unimaginative, unwelcome, and uninspired.

Geppetto (Tom Hanks) is a lonely Italian woodcarver who builds a marionette named Pinocchio (voice of Benjamin Evan Ainsworth) and treats him like his real son. With the help of a little magic from the Blue Fairy (Cynthia Erivo), the puppet comes to life and dreams of becoming a real boy. The film follows Pinocchio’s adventures and missteps on his quest to make this fantasy a reality, including being duped by Honest John (voice of Keegan-Michael Key), being kidnapped by a circus, getting turned into a donkey, and being swallowed by a whale. He does all of this with his conscience, Jiminy Cricket (voice of Joseph Gordon-Levitt), by his side.

The story stays mostly true to the original 1883 book and Disney animated film. It’s updated a bit with new characters and some very off-putting (and unfunny) one-liners about Hollywood and the movie industry, and the screenplay feels old fashioned as it attempts to modernize the messaging. Pinocchio exclaims, “I don’t need school!” when he decides that he wants to be famous instead of getting an education. That may be relevant to today’s social climate, yet it still feels like a reach.

Things get worse from there. The animation is ugly and disturbing, with plastic looking characters and equally ghastly voice performances. Gordon-Levitt is terrible as Jiminy Cricket, giving a whiny, strained turn as one of the story’s most cherished characters. Everyone seems to be trying too hard, although it’s puzzling as to the reason why. At least Hanks makes an excellent Geppetto.

The film includes a few original tunes that are forgettable, as well as new versions of classic songs “When You Wish Upon A Star,” “Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee,” and “I’ve Got No Strings,” which do not sound much better than nails dragging across a chalkboard. The singing is atrocious, and that’s putting it politely.

The Pleasure Island scenes are fully realized and a visual delight (let’s try to ignore that the “bad” boys do such horrific things like drinking root beer), but that’s where the praise begins and ends. The best part of the film is also its most ominous, and parents should note that the film is rated PG for a reasons. It features scary scenarios that may spook young kids, especially if they have abandonment issues or are afraid of the dark.

Almost everything about “Pinocchio” is cringe-worthy, and it’s simply not a good film. Why do this to a Disney classic?",2023-04-23T06:46:01.868Z,532639,2 stars,0.5020760893821716
CinemaSerf,6.0,"I think Robert Zemeckis was maybe trying to get closer to the original Disney version of this film from 1940, but it doesn't really work. Tom Hanks sparingly takes on the human role of the carpenter ""Geppetto"" who longs for a son. He crafts this wooden replica and magic takes an hand with the benevolent ""Blue Fairy"" turning him into the young ""Pinocchio"". This youngster's is a bit spoiled and is soon bored with the routine of his life at home and at school and before long is tempted by a visiting (and well paying) theatrical show who take him from the safety of ""Geppetto"" and, accompanied by narrator/conscience ""Jiminy Cricket"" we now see the boy experience adventures that demonstrate the venality, cruelty and selfishness of humanity as he gradually starts to yearn for the safety of his home and his father. This perilous journey does, however, help him grow. He begins to mature and discover the difference between right and wrong, truth and lie whilst meantime the old man is despairing and sets off to find him. Can they ever meet again? The animation is really enjoyable here, but the characterisations are all a bit feeble. The gist of this story has a darkness to it and that is lacking here. Granted, this isn't the easies of stories to Disneyfy with much more substance to the malevolence of the plot, but here we seem to have something that falls between two stools. It's not menacing, nor is it a ""cartoon"", it's just a bit soulless. Still, it's not unwatchable and if it encourages youngsters to read the book or check out a few of the grittier adaptations of the Collodi novel, then all's good.",2023-12-09T10:04:33.598Z,532639,3 stars,0.7094749212265015

""Samaritan holds quite an interesting premise, but sadly, it's yet another addition to the list of films with wasted potential.

What could have been a truly dark, fascinating story about two superpowered brothers with distinct views on life is, instead, a bland, predictable, formulaic narrative with less Sylvester Stallone than expected.

The cast offers good performances, but choosing to focus on Javon Walton's generic character when the prologue leaves room for such an engrossing exploration of the past proves to be a terrible decision. Action-wise, it lacks the energy and creativity necessary to entertain most viewers, despite the dedicated stunt work.

MovieGuys,6.0,"Samaritan is a by the numbers action flick but that's not necessarily a bad thing. 

One of the key problems with a lot of modern movie making, is the constant need to experiment and at times, inject social messages into what it supposed to be entertainment. 

Samaritan follows a well known and well worn, by the numbers, action film formula. It tries to throw in a twist I saw coming pretty early on but that's alright. In essence, this film is inherently watchable. Stallone still has excellent screen presence and the chemistry, between him and the young boy, works well.

My advice, ignore the carping from the soy latte class of movie goers who bemoan a lack of sophistication. Its often the simple things in life that are most enjoyable and this is one of them. 

In summary, Samaritan wont win any accolades for high brow cinema but what it does, it does competently enough to be reasonably enjoyable and entertaining.

Well despite the reticence of ""Smith"", the young man is determined that he can cajole his newfound friend into saving society. As the pair start to bond, we realise that this young man is decent and has potential and that his elderly chum has quite a few skeletons in his closet - though perhaps not quite the ones anyone is expecting. Sadly, though the young Walton is quite effective, the underused Stallone is just going through the motions and the story is an amalgam of loads of other DC/Marvel style affairs with some fairly pedestrian writing underpinning a disappointingly under-developed story.

EmmanuelGoldstein,10.0,"**Surprisingly deep for a Stallone movie**

Wonderful and uplifting movie and story with some relatively deep messages that I didn't expect in a superhero movie starring Stallone. The twist was good too and nicely build up, though maybe they were building up the twist a bit too well. Cause if you think about it, the title itself already gives away the twist, at least to someone who is familiar with the Bible and knows what ""Samaritan"" refers to.

Cause a ""good Samaritan"" isn't simply a good guy, but is actually someone who is supposed to be bad, but turns out to become good in the end, which is exactly what Stallone's character (Joe) goes through. So in a way, he really is the Samaritan of the movie and the true antagonist Cyrus, really is the perfect ""nemesis"" for him as they are actually perfect counterparts. While Joe becomes good, Cyrus becomes bad. While Joe starts fighting crime, Cyrus instigates it. While Joe bears his cross, Cyrus breaks the cross (literally). Joe is a loner who avoids crowds and hates getting attention, while Cyrus baths in crowds, leads them and incites them, and while Joe goes around looking for broken things (both objects as well as people) that he can fix, Cyrus believes in ""Ordo ab Chao"" or to put it more direct, in breaking things before things can be rebuild.

Talking on a deeper lever, there is both Christian and occult symbolism in this movie, though unlike with many other Hollywood movies, the occult aspects aren't glorified. And though the movie appears to be morally ambiguous, it actually isn't. Joe might seem like a very unchristian hero, but in the end he is probably the most Christian hero seen in a mainstream Hollywood movie in a long time.",2023-07-28T20:54:56.666Z,629176,4 stars,0.5975241661071777
CinemaSerf,6.0,"OK, so this is about as derivative as it is possible to get - but you know what, I actually quite enjoyed it. It's a short and sweet tale of the young ""Evie"" (Nathalie Emmanuel). She does one of those online DNA tests and before she knows it, is having a posh lunch with ""Oliver"" (Hugh Skinner) - a posh British lad who claims that she is his long lost cousin.

Upon arrival, she encounters their irascible butler ""Fields"" (Sean Pertwee) and then the hunky lord of the manor ""Walt"" (Thomas Doherty). She is smitten, indeed they are at it within twenty four hours - but soon she starts to sense that things at the new ""Carfax Manor"" are not quite what they may seem - not least because there is a distinct lack of bride and groom; and the waitresses employed to cater for the occasion have a habit of disappearing. What could be going on...? Well, it's fairly clear to us from the start who the baddie is, and that ""Viktoria"" (a sort of Angelina Jolie-esque Stephanie Corneliussen) and her pal ""Lucy"" (Alana Boden) are in on the cunning scheme too. It has clearly been done on a limited budget, but the direction is still just about adequate. The story, though, is pretty thin and the acting is drama school stuff for the most part before an ending that really does let the whole thing down rather badly.

The Movie Mob,6.0,"**The Invitation wastes great potential and ideas by trying too hard to be clever and failing.**

Reviews for The Invitation are mediocre at best but as harsh as they seem, they aren't too far off. The Invitation takes the successes of Ready or Not and blends them with the Dracula story putting a fresh new take on a familiar story. The film benefits from this new approach and introduces new characters and ideas. But that is where the good runs out. The first hour of the runtime forces a romance between the heroine and a painfully suspicious and uncomfortable forward rich guy. Unfortunately, the story gets so caught up in trying to fool the audience into thinking it is a simple romance movie, so it could shock with the vampire twist that it didn't leave time to make the conclusion feel rewarding or earned. Once the monsters finally revealed themselves, The Invitation sprinted to the end, with the inexperienced heroine easily besting Dracula and his minions; corrupt families and monsters had survived and thrived for hundreds of years. The victory sadly does not convince or satisfy. If The Invitation had spent less time on the failed love story and more time developing the vampire story, this could have been a good movie.",2022-09-17T06:03:36.804Z,830788,2 stars,0.6065256595611572
Nathan,5.0,"_The Invitation_ started off so well, but eventually morphed into a generic film that I could have predicted from a mile away. The set up to the movie was decent, but the second act was when I really thought this movie nailed it. I really enjoyed the somewhat sadistic back and forth between the two leads. On one hand, you see a woman ready to give herself over to the thought of love for the first time. While on the other hand, the audience knows this chance at love is built on a lie. Despite this fact, I found the chemistry incredibly strong between the two leads. I was smiling as their love story progressed, even though I knew it was not going to end well. Nathalie Emmanuel and Thomas Doherty do such an excellent job in this film. I loved their chemistry and Dohery does such a great Jekyll and Hyde with the unearthly vampire masked by the charismatic lord. Super entertaining watching them do great work here.

The creepy disturbing nature of the trailers was not overly present here, almost all of the unsettling imagery was used for the trailers and leaves the rest of the movie feeling pretty generic. This is even more evident when the movie turns into a vampire action flick reminiscent of the Twilight movies. At this moment, I was completely ripped out of the movie and was ready for it to end. This drastic change in tone really did not fit well here for me.

CinemaSerf,5.0,"This is just the gift that keeps on giving... Only thing is, once you take the admittedly attractive wrapping from the box, the present is empty! This continues the on/off, love/hate, familial discord of ""Tessa"" (Josephine Langford) and her beau ""Hardin"" (Hero Fiennes Tiffin). The thrust here (and there is far less actual thrusting in this film than in the others) seems to be to prove that the young lovers are maturing; they are beginning to realise that they are more two peas in a pod than we might have originally considered. This also develops the roles of the parents - especially ""Trish"" (Louise Lombard) and ""Ken"" (Rob Estes) as we discover they have plenty of demons of their own, and so frankly it is no real wonder that the weans have grown up quite so dysfunctional. It is hard to know just quite who this film is for. The story is all over the place, the melodrama weak and implausible and the characterisations become less and less engaging as this tiresome and frankly rather boring franchise drags all of their unwanted dirty washing onto the screen. It is also quite difficult to know whom this is relevant too or for, and HFT is as wooden as a board throughout. The production is adequate, clearly these have been made on a modest budget, but the writing is as infantile as the performances.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"""Alithea"" (Tilda Swinton) is a solitary scholar who travels to Istanbul to address a conference on the relative merits of myth v science. At the seminar, she starts to hallucinate and the seed is sown that perhaps the mystical is not so far-fetched as we might think! A visit to the Grand Bazaar sees her acquire a small blue bottle that, when attacked rather unceremoniously with an electric toothbrush, spills it's contents into her hotel room. A giant, hairy-legged Djinn (Idris Elba). In keeping with tradition, he offers her three wishes - but she is sceptical. Easy come, easy goes thinks she - and as the couple chat, she discovers just how he became incarcerated in this, his third, bottle. His are tales of love, lust, greed, power and sadness and he depicts them to her of his life of some thousands of years. He also declares just why it is so important that she actually makes her wishes; for without those he can never attain his freedom. It's good fun this film. An anthology of scenarios that entertain and amuse with a worldly and generous effort from the sagely Swinton who gradually falls in love with her now normal-sized companion. The dynamic between the two stars is engaging and effective, the latter delivering a charming contribution to a simple story of the problems of a series of unrequited loves over the centuries that will probably never find a straightforward solution! It's a quirky film, that moves along quickly and I really quite enjoyed it.",2022-09-03T06:26:38.667Z,556694,4 stars,0.6496850252151489

""Three Thousand Years of Longing is one of the most ambitious films of the year.

Relying on the genuinely charming, mesmerizing performances of Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton, George Miller approaches a famous cautionary tale through a distinctive form of storytelling, focusing on flashbacks narrated by the male protagonist. The multiple stories of the past aren't always fascinating, partially due to the chosen narrative method, which becomes repetitive despite enriching some of the core themes.

The immersive, atmospheric visuals elevate the overall piece with significant impact, making this a cinematic experience to leave any viewer contemplating life, desire, loneliness, and happiness.""

Nathan,5.0,"I did not have many expectations for _Three Thousand Years of Longing_, but after leaving the theater it left me longing for more. I do not think any individual part of this film was inherently bad. The performances by Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton were captivating and their on-screen chemistry was amazing. The flash backs to the characters' lives were very fascinating. I really enjoyed exploring the lives of ancient civilizations in the eyes of George Miller. The overarching plot was decent, nothing spectacular. But the collection of all these different elements together just felt like a jumbled mess. The movie never gets in a groove and always feels like it is stumbling its way to the finish line. I felt the opening sequence was incredibly rushed and the audience does not really get to form a connection with Alithea before she unleashes the Djinn, and from there on the audience is whipped back and forth from flashback to present day and it feels incredibly disjointed. The jumbled up second act, deflates any type of momentum going into the third making it fall flat on its head. All this compiled together made a somewhat emotional and touching ending feel hollow and lackluster. Overall, as a collection of short stories this movie was a good time, but really does not belong together in a jumbled-up mess of a plot.

It's full of plot holes, baffling behavior by the main characters and dialogue that is so badly written that it's almost comical. Not to mention the frequent time skips without any indication - it ends up being the viewer's job to figure out if multiple months just passed between scenes.

I could go on listing negative things that irked me about this film, but I'm not sure if I'd stay within the character limit if I did. So I'm just going to mention the one nice detail that I thought was well done: The scene where the policewoman inspects the peephole in the door of the panic room was a really nice ""gotcha"" moment. Shame it didn't lead to anything plot-wise though and was followed up by yet another dumb and incomprehensible scene.

The story hits on a lot of elements that the resonant with millennials while exploring them in a way that feels genuine.

Emily the Criminal chronicles a woman's impossible struggle to find work and survive with the insurmountable burden of her criminal record standing in the way. Eventually, honest employment seems impossible, so she turns to a more lucrative but more illegal method of income. Her path to success in the credit card fraud racket was interesting, with all the dangers of her new work and the pressure of avoiding getting caught. Unfortunately, the plot's pacing ebbed and flowed between long sections of an engaging and exciting story and long sections of slower, less interesting content. The title's meaning transformed as the movie progressed and the characters developed, but the final moments just saddened me.

Ahmad,7.0,"While “Emily the Criminal” isn't for everyone, it does succeed on many fronts. It's not your run-of-the-mill crime flick; instead, it's an in-depth look at the mind of its main character and examination of criminal behaviour. The film's overall noir vibe appeals to me, and I think its effectiveness as a small-scale thriller stems from its commitment to staying grounded, scaled down, and focused. Additionally commendable is Plaza's performance, and given that this is John Patton Ford's directorial debut, he, too, is deserving of recognition for his efforts. Yet, despite its entertaining nature, the film fails to make a lasting impression.

""Day Shift is one of the most pleasant surprises of the year!

As expected, it doesn't reinvent the wheel - formulaic screenplay and paper-thin characters - but the care and dedication involved in the stunt choreography, minimal use of CGI, and extraordinary camerawork (Toby Oliver) make this project packed with action - sometimes even too much - one of the most entertaining vampire movies of the last decade.

Jamie Foxx serves well enough as the badass protagonist in J. J. Perry's first feature film - the former stuntman impresses in such a way that he could easily become a well-recognized director within the action genre.

Did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did! Day Shift brings a fresh new vibe to the vampire hunter genre, with most of the movie taking place in the bright sunny suburbs of LA. The action and fight sequences near John Wick-level choreography (which is not surprising since Chad Stahelski is involved) and the world built by Day Shift is intriguing and worth further exploration in future films.

DallasBob,9.0,"I liked it.  It's good weekend movie or late night flick.  It's not terribly deep but it has good special effects and good quality acting.  The action scenes, when there needs to be action, are good.  There is a good flow from scene to scene which staves off that dreaded ""grade B film"" feel.  

The comedy is good and not overly done or cheesy.  I liked the sector chief, he was funny for being the grimey-boss.  And Snoop Dogg was okay in the same laid back way he is. I still believe he fit the role of Jimmy Bones a lot better; though that movie was definitely for the $5 bin at Walmart.  I believe Snoop would do very well as a Master Vamp or boss-guy-sitting-in-the chair type figure.  As long as he doesn't have to emote.  He does very well in line delivery which makes great comedy if you know how to write for him. 

All the actors did well in their roles.  The villaness was good in her role, very arrogant & dispicable (nice on the eyes).  The two vamp-killing brothers were both funny and performed great in their action scenes.  And the speical effects, car chase scenes, and both the Home invasion and Nest scenes were top notch. The studio got their moneies worth when they hired the stuntman company.   
  
I do think they went a little hard with the ""wimpy"" sidekick thing.  I didn't expect what happened to Franco's character to happen.  I thought maybe he'd get his act togther when the circumstances got intense, but the writers took him in another direction that suprisingly (though not terribly original) made sense with the story.  
And I'm not sure WHY, but I keep getting Dave Franco and Zac Efron confused for one another...? (maybe it's the eyebrows)  Franco has been in a number of teen movies and blockbusters...sorta kinda.  I liked the _Fright Night_ re-make, _Neighbors 1 & 2_,(despite Seth Rogan being poison since the Santa Inc. debacle) and the _Now You See Me 1 & 2_ movies.  He's not terrible.  He did well for his character (and props to his stuntman) in this movie. 

As I said before, this is a good vampire movie.  It's not exactly _Fright Night_, or _30 Days of Night_, but definitely holds its own.  If I had to give it similarity by comparison, then I would say it leans more toward _Dusk til Dawn_, than anything else.

ObjectivityGate,7.0,"Even if the story was kind of lackluster, the film itself was incredible.  If you consider the tower as a kind of true main character of the movie.  

On first watching this I can instantly imagine the blustering cacophony of outrage about climbing technique from viewers.  From the first, the film is rather jarring but honest about its juvenile depiction of ""climbing"".  At the start I had to decide NOT to care about how realistic it was because it would be wrong to reduce a film abductio absurdum because it is a story after all.  A creation.  It isn't being judged on its ability to remind one of real life so much as to forget it.  I do this 'forgetting' voluntarily and I seem to enjoy films more. 

I felt my body constricting away slightly and getting anxious during the gravity yawning scenes, 2000ft above the ground!  The characters were reckless enough to believe they would die at almost any time.  It was unrelenting in the tension.  

Even if the writing is kind of silly at times, there are elements in a film, perhaps shown through other mediums besides the writing itself that can raise the score of the film quite a bit. Consider the cinematography.  The deft and skilled work at showing the tension existing in every moment by rattling bolts in close up with uncanny metallic sounds protesting the extra weight.  The drone shots that highlight the mind bending fear of such a radical location.   Honestly!  It seemed like such a labor of love of the filmmakers.  They immediately saw how much could be done with the location.

  The story felt like a vehicle for the film which was this awesome gigantic testament to the fear of heights.  The movie poster sold this one for me because I was thinking, well, even if it isn't that good, the idea itself is good enough to be fascinating.  Consider the main character of the movie: the tower itself.  It said nothing the entire time, but it was the star of every scene.   Such as it was, the story was like kind of this extra fluff that you had to deal with, but what a cool film.  

There was an amazing number of times I was 'triggered' by how silly and unrealistic the climbing aspects were, and how insanely reckless it became.  However, I don't believe that anyone thinks this a film to be studying climbing from.  It isn't even showing climbing's artistic nature which is the film's biggest pitfall.  I loved how the arc centered around conquering your fears through this metaphorical path of climbing and I'm sure a lot of climbers embraced that, and were reminded of it, but it was a crime to leave out why the characters are pursuing this passion.",2022-09-01T23:49:58.044Z,985939,4 stars,0.3839891850948334

Grace Curry and Virginia Gardner’s despair seemed authentic through their convincing performances. Panic and distress filled every shot as the camera soaked in the unbelievable heights and endless landscapes.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Right. First things first. Understood that you erect a 2000ft television relay tower back in the day, but when that industry moves to satellite delivery, why on Earth would anyone just leave this gradually rusting structure standing - only for it to come crashing down one day when the metal fatigue has won out? Hmmm! Anyway, luckily for us the planner's ineptitude allowed for ""Becky"" (Grace Caroline Currey) and her friend ""Hunter"" (Virginia Gardner) to go climb it. It's quite a big deal for the former woman - she had been free-climbing almost one year earlier with her friend and her husband ""Dan"" (Mason Gooding) when disaster struck and she has spent much of the intervening period married to Jack Daniels. Scorning any sensible planning - food, gloves etc. up they go - there is a ladder - and are soon at the top surveying the immensity of the view. Time to go down, the ladder gives way. The two are lucky to have the platform right at the top to take refuge on, but their bag - water and drone contained within - falls 50 feet and balances precariously on a redundant satellite dish below. What's to do? The plot really does take a quite cynical turn when they fire a flare to attract the attention of some men in a nearby camper van, only for the guys to spot them and then proceed to steal their car! Otherwise, this is really just a remarkable feat of photography that certainly had my palms sweating. Director Scott Mann and the cinematographer (MacGregor) do manage to effectively draw us into the two friend's predicament and if you are even vaguely acrophobic, then this film can be a really tough watch at times. Sadly, though, in the search for characterisation we discover that even at altitude, there is a place for a rather tiresome melodrama. Thereafter it is quite difficult to warm to either of the women who are being harried by some hungry buzzards as they perch! The ending is not good. To be fair, it isn't straightforward either, it has a few quirks to keep us on our toes - but they are not terribly realistic quirks. Enjoy is not the correct word for this film - I cannot say I was too relaxed for much of my time in the cinema tonight, but if this is to be seen at all, then it does need that big screen. On television it will lose much of it's photographic impact and that really is all this film is worth watching for - the acting and repetitive ""Are you OK?"" dialogue leaves much to be desired.",2022-09-04T22:23:30.470Z,985939,3 stars,0.3775380551815033
Feng,8.0,"**might contain spoilers**

What a great murder mystery film. As an amateur climber, I too was initially put off by the amount of unprofessional climbing techniques. However, if they were truly climbing/solo enthusiasts, how could they not get injured way before they take on any big challenges? (And from a filmmaking perspective, with climbing being such a popular sports, surly it is not hard to get some random joe from the gym to tell the film crew that those techniques are horrible! also there are other suspicious common-sense defying points later…) The answer of course, what we watched is just simply a **recounting of Becky’s version of what transpired!!!** Then all the inaccuracies makes perfect sense as that’s how you get the authorities to believe why the “accidents” happened in the first place — sheer negligence and amateur skills!

I believe what happened was that Becky found out that she was cheated on, then plotted to get rid of the asshat by either screwing with the cam placements and/or - as filmed but with a malignant intent - to get rid of the rope too liberally. And no one else knows exactly how good the cam placements are or whether they were tempered with - Hunter is way above them busy down-climbing!

Then, this explains perfectly her year-long depression as even if not fully planned out, her imo premeditated actions naturally put herself in even deeper sense of guilt.

Then there’s the forever unknowable fact that whether the tower trips is truly initiated by Hunter. Possibly Becky saw Hunter is living a guilt-free life and had another urge for murder and proposed to feed Hunter this great youtube/instagram clickbait trip to convince her to come along! Although the film depicts that Hunter is very heartwarming at times, it’s entirely plausible that Hunter **is** in fact the care-free personality that she demonstrates in **all her videos online!** (which might makes her more murderable in Becky’s eye). So Becky could be using a very high-IQ way of framing her victims as compassionate sweethearts.

Finally, the biggest telltale sign that the final accident is premeditated (and possibly intended by the filmcrew/writer) is that when Becky lastly went for Hunter’s body to drop down the phone, she **instinctively — rightfully so for a climber** clipped the carabiner to the lowest stable point which is the as yet unbroken ladder!!!(and the film gave this a real good close-up) Why on earth wouldn’t Hunter do that when she went down to retrieve the bag???!!! This is not just bad climbing, this defies common sense! We were all screaming how stupid it was of Hunter to do what she did in the bag sequence and now we know, **these are all extremely likely fabrications recounted by Becky at the end of the accident!**

Lastly, some keen chinese filmgoers also noted the “mistake” on the poster where in fact **the ladders are failing while Becky’s at the top and Hunter is still climbing!** Maybe this is a hint from the production team ;)

tmdb28039023,4.0,"I can’t help having a soft spot for a movie that name-drops several pro wrestlers as a means to convey a nice bit of subtle foreshadowing, and plays Warrants «Cherry Pie» on its soundtrack like every five minutes.

On the other hand, it’s very difficult to empathize with the characters in this film; anyone who climbs a rusty, super creaky 2,000 foot TV tower (a choice so inane that under normal circumstances it’s known as the Fallacy of the Climbing Villain) in the middle of bumfuck nowhere just for shits and giggles deserves whatever’s coming to them. 

The rationale, such as it is, behind the protagonists’ actions is that life is «too short» and «you gotta do something that makes you feel alive.» Methinks they’re confusing joie de vivre with having a fucking death wish. According to these people’s logic, Bobby De Niro and Chris Walken were really sucking the marrow out of life in those Russian roulette scenes from The Deer Hunter.  

Now, that climbing artificial structures (known as buildering as well as several other names) is a reckless (not to mention illegal) thing to do doesn’t necessarily mean that those who do it take it lightly. I’m sure a lot of planning and prepping and getting in shape mentally and physically (even the relatively simple act of climbing a ladder becomes a Herculean labor when the ladder is twice as tall as the Eiffel Tower) precedes the actual deed.

We don’t see any of that here; not even a training montage. For Hunter (Virginia Gardner) and Becky (Grace Caroline Currey) it’s an overnight decision; sure, Hunter says she’s has «planned» it, and she’s some sort of daredevil You Tuber, but Becky is an out-of-practice rock climber who has ostensibly become a drunken slob in the year since her husband’s Disney Villain Death. 

All of the above notwithstanding, the film certainly makes the most of its chosen setting. The landscape around the top of the tower (consisting of a «pizza-size platform») betrays a green screen quality to it, but this is a rare occasion in which this actually works in the movie’s favor; at such dizzying heights, wouldn’t the world and everything in it look surreal? Or, to put it more bluntly, wouldn’t your perception get all screwed up?

The visual effects used to do those scenes were fairly well done and even though it is a movie with two (naïve) climbers being stuck on top of a tower, the film co-scripted and directed by Scott Mann still was quite entertaining. The performances from both Grace Caroline Currey and Virginia Gardner were well done (Jeffrey Dean Morgan only had a couple minutes of screen time and likely did this as a favor to Mann as the pair previously worked together on 2015’s Heist).

**_Fall_** isn’t a movie I’d watch again, not unlike many other of these survival thrillers (like 47 Meters Down, Shallows, 127 Hours), but it’s still well worth a watch especially on a Friday or Saturday night with nothing else that might catch your eye.

As a side, apparently this was shot for an R-rating with numerous f-bombs which were dubbed over once Lionsgate was distributing and in one scene the replacement of two f-bombs with “fricking” was pretty laughable. **3.75/5**",2022-10-10T05:37:03.960Z,985939,3 stars,0.8257744908332825

""Fall is one of the biggest surprises of the year! Its premise automatically brings high levels of adrenaline, suspense, and tension - especially for acrophobes - and Scott Mann achieves the ideal mix of realism and absurdity.

It doesn't go overboard to the point of causing countless ""eye rolls"", nor is it too generic and inconsequential, adding a rather impactful narrative twist near the third act. Grace Caroline Currey shines alongside an also competent Virginia Gardner, both having enough time to lead a character-driven story focused mainly on a single location.

Too bad the frustratingly abrupt ending prevents the movie from reaching the next level...""

Nathan,3.0,"Going into Fall, I did not have super high hopes, and unfortunately it met my expectations. This movie attempts to be something far greater than it ever needed to be, resulting in a super bloated experience that just feels completely unfocused. The nearly two-hour runtime is entirely too long for a plot that is on the surface, fairly bare bones. But the screenplay attempts to deliver multiple subplots that are supposed to develop our characters, but all it did was take away from the tension that it was building. For every scene where I was gripping my chair waiting to see what will happen next, there is a scene where the two characters talk about their feelings for far too long. Furthermore, there are story elements that are either too convenient or exist solely as obstacles for the sake of obstacles which detract from the overall believability.

I do think Grace Caroline Currey is going to have a fantastic future in this industry, but her performance alongside Virginia Gardner left a lot to be desired. Currey did her best to save a pretty horrendous script, but it just was not enough. Despite this, the movie was directed fairly well, with great shots of the tower and of the action that was ensuing. The cinematography was fantastic, with beautiful skyboxes and sharp silhouettes of our protagonists that I particularly enjoyed.

Overall, I think this film would have been much better if it had stuck to being a cheesy thriller with a bare bones plot. All the extra filler really weighed down the overall experience.

CinemaSerf,5.0,"There are a few scenes in this that are vaguely menacing, but for the most part it is really, really poor! Idris Elba (""Nate"") arrives with his daughters ""Mer"" (Iyana Halley) and ""Norah"" (Leah Jeffries) at at remote African game reserve run by his friend ""Martin"" (Sharlto Copley). Pretty soon we realise that the luggage they brought on the plane is but the tip of the iceberg of baggage that actually accompanied this family and we are quickly immersed in a rather unattractive melodrama surrounding his late wife who tragically passed away (hopefully before seeing this film). Anyway, they are out on a guided tour when they discover that all is not well - an huge rogue lion is out to avenge himself on humanity after a group of poachers annihilated his pride. Snacking with impunity, this lion is soon determined to make a meal of these travellers - but can they stay alive long enough for help to arrive? Elba struggles to deliver consistency with his rather un-necessary American accent, the two girls are frankly just annoying and from very early on, I was wholeheartedly on the side of the lion. Curiously (or fortunately for the narrative), this great beast has virtually no sense of smell so ""Nate"" and his offspring seem to manage to dice with death on an implausibly regular basis. Taking shelter in an old school - leaving all the doors open for added protection; getting in and out of their land cruiser with scant regard for their safety and armed with little more than a pen-knife. The dialogue is OK - that's because it says it over and over again... ""Are you OK?"" ""Are You OK""? The last few scenes are just plain silly - indeed, they reminded me of my schoolboy enjoyment of ""Daktari"" (1966) with the friendly ""Clarence the cross-eyed lion"" married together with one of the those semi-educational Disney films with actuality interspersed into the fiction.

Beast is a decent creature movie entry with some good actors and immersive camerawork. Unfortunately, the digital effects on the lion are distracting and prevent the tension from fully building.

tmdb28039023,1.0,"I think the key to figuring out this movie is an early scene in which one of the characters is wearing a Jurassic Park shirt. This must be the filmmakers winking their eye at the audience, letting us know that what we’re about to see is all in jest. 

How else to explain a film where the protagonists arrive in South Africa and immediately start bitching about the heat, but they’re all wearing jackets, and sweaters, and hoodies? More importantly, how are we to interpret a movie that introduces the issues of poaching (people who kill lions) and anti-poaching (people who kill people who kill lions, or at least that’s what Beast thinks it is), only to have the antagonist be a maneater (a lion that kills people regardless of their stance on poaching).

This only perpetuates the myth that lions have never met a human they didn’t want to maul (while contributing nothing to the poaching debate). I’m not saying lions follow an animal version of the First Law of Robotics, but they do get a bad rap in the movies, as do sharks — and in that sense, Beast is closer to Jaws: The Revenge than Jaws. Actually, Beast is even worse than Jaws: The Revenge because the latter at least used a mechanical shark, as opposed to the former’s pitiful CGI lion. 

All things considered, this is a film that makes you yearn for the simplicity of The Ghost and the Darkness, which made no pretense of being anything other than a Hemingway-lite story about male bonding over hunting big game (and which, though taking many liberties with the source material, had the decency to feature real lions). 

Here, however, the hero tricks two other lions into killing the 'evil' lion, not only a gambit that could easily backfire, but also not very nature-friendly. Although coming to think about it, maybe these lions do comply with the second part of the First Law (""A robot [or in this case, lion] may not ... through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm"").",2022-09-13T21:10:02.320Z,760741,4 stars,0.36324745416641235

Idris Elba is generally mediocre anyway, but he can put on an acceptable performance with a decent script and concept. Sadly, neither was available to him in this bumbling, tragic, and failed effort to create dramatic cinema. 

I'm amazed that anyone could create a movie based on such a predictable and often used concept and do it so badly. One poorly contrived scene after another, belief is not just suspended, but abandoned entirely to piece together a cartoonish presentation of sappy ideas and bad cgi. The script is equally dreary, simplistic, and filled with mostly predictable chatter, until it suddenly leaps off the cliff of reality and into the void of astoundingly stupid. Sadly, that happens far too often.

Don't bother going to the cinema to see this. Wait a few weeks for it to get relegated to Pluto TV, Amazon Prime Video,  or Freevee. Honestly, it won't take long.",2022-09-23T07:07:57.434Z,760741,1 star,0.8365230560302734

This movie does a lot right, don't get me wrong. The buildup to the encounter was done really well. You get a great introduction to all the characters and the individual struggles they go through due to the loss of Dr. Nate Daniels wife; it gives a baseline for the viewer to be able to relate and sympathize with the character. The action is pretty decent, and I was really impressed with the CGI work done on the lion. But, once the climax ensues the writing goes downhill, mainly in terms of character decision making. I found that the writers did not really know how to create unique situations to put the characters in with the lion, resulting in baffling decision to prolong the duration of the film. At every turn, a solution is so easily in view, but they do something that is such a right turn that it is unbelievable. The performance of Idris Alba really pulls the score up though. He does a fantastic job and portrays the loving and protecting nature of a father so well. I enjoyed his cool calm collected nature during high pressure scenes, it gave a sense of reality to him being a doctor. Overall, this film is not great, but it was entertaining, and I had a good time.

Sharlto Copley is solid, while young actors Iyana Halley and Leah Sava Jeffries are OK; though their characters are written to act in an irritating way.

Kgprophet,6.0,"“Snatch” On A Train

 It should not be a coincidence that Bullet Train and the movie Snatch both feature Brad Pitt.   This kind of offbeat storytelling appeals to Pitt.  I get a flashback of Pitt in “Twelve Monkeys”, embracing the lunacy.   One might also see Tarantino in the storytelling as well.  Most of the critics get it right though, the execution is a little flat.   What works however are the montages of the other assassins and their backstory.  The entire production, and I mean every single shot, feels like it is from a graphic novel.  Careful attention to glowing backlights from buttons or tv screens or fancy lighting in general makes this bristle with Japanese cityscape.   In fact every shot of the Bullet train that goes from Tokyo to Kyoto (which I have taken myself) shows it as (CGI) cityscape.  So the slick feel is done by using cutaway shots of the bullet train never leaving the city (believe it our not in reality the train does go through some countryside) as a punch point as some stunning event happens with the plot.   

So this is a thriller, and it tries to throw in some whodunnit of who killed who.  It also adds tension as our protagonist does not know he is in possible danger while the audience has been clued in.   I like the attempt to go against stereotypes with our main characters.   That includes the rich adolescent daughter.  Dressed innocently, she actually has a cold heart.   As for Brad Pitt, he is a little too “this all for fun”, and becomes a little too relaxed in a movie star going through the motions kind of way.   Which I guarantee is not what Pitt is actually doing.  I think he takes any role seriously and is acting out his character to the fullest.   It's just that his character feels a but thin here.  

I felt the movie started off on the wrong foot with the banter between Pitt and his handler.  As an editor, I would trusted the audience to let Pitt enter the story without the on the nose exposition.  I also think that a slightly more serious tone would not make the gratuitous violence feel so comic book.   Therein lies the reason this movie exists in the first place, John Wick.  Audiences are expecting creative action sequences,  and there are many set pieces that take advantage of being stuck on a train.  Two other main characters are a lower class set of English assassins, straight from “Snatch”.   That movie depicted a good number of lower class criminals in England speaking goofy dialogue and taking part in some Three Stooges style of mishaps.   The duo here spend the entire movie bickering, finding their personal problems more interesting than our caper.   I felt their schtick was pushed (their names are Tangerine and Lemon), and the expected humour didn't really connect with the audience.  Which is too bad, because they are essentially the main characters, probably getting more screen time than Pitt.  

The Japan setting worked very well, although I expect that none of the film was actually shot in Japan, except maybe one of the early establishing shots.   The stylish production design necessitated lots of embellishments to the slick backgrounds that the real world can't match.  That's OK, I appreciated how cool the movie looked as this convoluted world of Japanese but not Japanese criminals go after the Macguffin.   That is, although this a Japanese crime movie, many of the key characters are not Japanese.  

As for the action scenes, they are serviceable with a mix of weapons and hand to hand fighting.   However there is an annoying habit of victims dying and not dying.   Those type of one twist too many issues prevent this movie from being a James Bond kind of generic thriller that delivers the goods.   I just recently saw “Gray Man”, and took note that although the story had nothing original to say, it stayed to it's core action tenets and didn't try to confuse the audience with any real twists.   So even though both of these films are losers for the critics, there still is a level of roller coaster ride mentality that makes a well made action yarn enjoyable.  So I enjoyed this more than those recent lazy Fast and Furious films, but found the story too convoluted, even more than “Gray Man”.  6 out of 10.",2022-08-06T04:16:53.232Z,718930,3 stars,0.5106680989265442
garethmb,-1.0,"I first got an extended look at “Bullet Train” during Cinemacon when a reel of the film was shown during the Sony showcase to an enthusiastic crowd. The footage mixed action and humor with quirky and dysfunctional characters and became a must-see film for me based on the teased footage.

The film is based on a book by Kotaro Isaka and stars Brad Pitt as an operative named Ladybug. He is called at the last minute as a replacement and given instructions to board a Bullet Train and snatch a case in one of the passenger areas before exiting at the next station.

Having gone through a recent crisis, Ladybug is awash in various philosophical and new age ideas as he attempts to find his inner peace and a new path in life, as such he does not take a gun with him when he boards despite being instructed to do so by his handler.

The train is filled with various killers and dangerous people who are there to accomplish various goals and most of whom fail frequently in violent and hysterical manners which further complicate their agendas as well as that of the others and often puts them into conflict with one another as the story unfolds.

It would be difficult to go into further detail on the various characters without spoiling some of the reveals and twists along the way but suffice it to say that Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry as Tangerine and Lemon are great and their banter, as well as capers, is a frequent highlight.

There are some surprise cameos in the film which add to the fun and Joey King is as great as perhaps one of the more complicated characters in the film. Pitt is clearly the star but the film allows him as well as his supporting cast plenty of moments to shine and the humor flies fast and frequent as does the action which creates a very engaging and stylistic hybrid of western and Asian cinema.

The film does drag slightly late before leading to the finale but thanks to the great cast and action it comes through in the end.

Director David Leitch has worked on films such as “Deadpool 2”, “Atomic Blonde”, and “John Wick: and you can see that he has a knack for directing action and comedy as this is a very fun and engaging film that has some great action and humor and one that you will not want to miss.

Personally, I wasn't expecting much from <em>'Bullet Train'</em> at all. The (most overplayed) trailer didn't fill with me with much interest and I thought the bullet train aspect would be gimmicky and perhaps even too limiting. However, to my surprise it's the exact opposite to all that. It's supremely entertaining and very amusing!

I love the whole style of the film, the editing is top notch. the bloody visuals are class and the music is superbly chosen - every track hits. Then you also have an excellent cast. I thought, again based on the trailer(s) that I saw, it would be a run-of-the-mill Brad Pitt feature, but his performance is terrific throughout.

Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry are a quality double act, I thought their accents and dynamic would get tiresome but if anything I enjoyed them the more I saw them - funny guys! Joey King was the only character I wasn't sold on during the film, though by the end I dug her performance too.

Andrew Koji and Hiroyuki Sanada are also very good, while Michael Shannon, Benito A. Martínez Ocasio (aka Bad Bunny) and Zazie Beetz are welcomed cast members as well. There are also a few other noteworthy people involved, including two that Pitt knows well from a different <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lost-city-2022/"" rel=""nofollow"">2022 flick</a>. Seriously, what a cast!

If I had to mention one gripe, it would be the run time/pacing - this is me nit-picking, though at like one or two (no more than that) moments I did feel like it wasn't paced incredibly. Again, no biggie though. All in all, I most definitely had a great time with this and would certainly recommend it.*

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Brad Pitt is ""Ladybug"" - a now zen-like, semi-retired, hitman brought out of retirement to appropriate a suitcase from a train. Easy enough task, you might think - especially as he obtains it relatively easily. It then transpires, though, that there is much more afoot. Also on the train are the two guys who own the suitcase - ""Lemon"" (Brian Tyree Henry) and his twin ""Tangerine"" (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who have been tasked with rescuing the recently kidnapped son of the legendary ""White Death"" crime lord and his ransom (in the suitcase). When the pair discover that their loot has gone missing and that their charge has developed a rather nasty habit of bleeding from the eyes, they have to keep their suspicious employer at bay and find their luggage whilst this high-speed train hurtles from Tokyo to Kyoto. Add to the mix the slightly enigmatic ""Prince"" (Joey King) - outwardly a charming, butter-wouldn't-melt, schoolgirl type, but really a gal who is also up to something with the rather hapless ""Kimura"" (Andrew Kohi) whose son she had recently pushed from a roof and, well... Yes, the plot is pretty convoluted at the start but with a monologue style narrative well delivered by an on-form Pitt, and an engaging repartee between the 'Thomas the Tank Engine"" obsessed ""Lemon"" and his spiritual brother, this actually makes for quite a decent action adventure. It is way too long - it could comfortably shave twenty minutes from the character establishment phase, but the script is quickly paced and sometimes quite clever and there are plenty of action scenes that are fun to watch and don't take too long. It has shades of ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) I thought - multiple characters with entertaining storylines that gradually involve and synergise all the characters. The ending isn't the best, and perhaps one might wonder about the complete lack of security not just on the train but at just about every station between the two cities. Carnage ensues pretty readily but no sign of a blue light. It's fun, throwaway, entertainment that follows on from ""The Lost City"" in which Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum allow Pitt the supporting role that he allows to both of them - and a tiny but of Ryan Reynolds too, if you are eagle-eyed, here. It's factory fodder, and you won't remember it by Christmas - but it's still nice to see some folks having fun on a big screen with no pretence whatsoever.",2022-08-15T10:10:56.994Z,718930,4 stars,0.4924527704715729
The Movie Mob,7.0,"**Bullet Train combines all the action, expertise, and stunt work of John Wick with the pacing, goofiness, and fun of Hot Fuzz.**

High energy, vibrant colors, funny characters, and excellent action fuel Bullet Train to take its audience on a wild and entertaining ride. Each character is larger than life and outrageous, but all fit perfectly in this vivid and comical world. Bullet Train feels like Edgar Wright’s version of John Wick - all the action is there, but so are all the comedy and quirky characters. Brad Pitt’s prowess as an actor shines as his ridiculous peace-loving assassin blunders through the film but never crosses the line into cliche or too much. Brian Tyree Henry’s Lemon is the most entertaining out of a cast of enthusiastic over-the-top characters that will have you laughing from the first second til the credits roll. Funny cameos and great action punctuate this already fun and colorful film. Bullet Train is a fun watch, but some poor visual effects distract from the ending and keep the rating from being higher. Even with its few faults, Bullet Train is a goofy, dynamic, and bright action flick that invents a fun world I wouldn’t mind exploring in future films.",2022-09-28T20:06:23.164Z,718930,4 stars,0.7050796151161194

Per Gunnar Jonsson,9.0,"This was a fund movie indeed, and quite woke-free at that. The fact that the woke crap site Rotten Tomatoes has marked it as rotten (despite it having more than 50% positive critics reviews) was a good sign of course.

It is an action/comedy about an unbelievably unlucky (and a bit stupid) assassin played by Brad Pitt. The movie mixes action, comedy, a bit of suspense and a fair amount of gore in a quite enjoyable package.

The movie balances the comedy bits right on the line where it would turn silly and cringe-worthy but there was really only one place where I went “Oh no, what the f…?”.

The action bits are overall quite good but this is Hollywood with their armada of clueless script writers so sometimes they get a bit ridiculous. Like being able to hang on to the outside of a bullet train while it speeds away.

Although fairly unbelievable and over the top, the core story actually makes some sense but then, it was not written by some Hollywood hack but instead based on a novel.

Peter McGinn,7.0,"I see there are a LOT of reviews of Bullet Train here, so I will be brief. I usually only watch action movies if they contain a large element of humor and, if possible, an actor I like. So I gave Bullet Train a try. I figured Brad Pitt wouldn’t get involved with a totally awful film.

So yes, it was humorous and often entertaining, with the comic book violence action films often seem to include, I guess because the audience demands it. I almost gave up on it halfway through, not because it was boring but just because the story seemed so shallow and the subplots didn’t grab me.  But the film’s action moved along fast enough for me to stick with it. Like I said, it is entertaining in places and witty overall, though I can’t imagine ever watching it a second time.",2023-01-01T17:46:39.654Z,718930,3 stars,0.5082619786262512
Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,9.0,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

It takes a lot for a film to surprise me, and I love it when one does. “Bullet Train” is chocked full of so much stylish, bloody, violent fun that it reminds me why I love movies in the first place. Director David Leitch brings a confident, creative vision to his Guy Ritchie-meets-Gareth Evans-meets Matthew Vaughn-meets Quentin Tarantino style that’s rambunctious, frenzied, and in your face. While some will detest this sort of mayhem, many fans of the genre will join me in enthusiastically screaming, “shoot this into my veins!“

Unlucky assassin Ladybug (Brad Pitt) is tired of the brutality. He’s back for another job, but has pledged to work peacefully and without a weapon. Ladybug has been tasked with retrieving a silver briefcase from a high-speed train in Japan, which seems simple enough. Fate steps in, naturally, putting a damper on his well-intentioned plans. The train is filled with the most lethal adversaries (and one deadly snake) from around the globe, and they all want the same thing. Chaos ensues in what may be a literal last man standing scenario.

Based on the book by Kôtarô Isaka, the film takes place almost solely onboard a train, but it never feels claustrophobic. Despite tight close-ups and many dialogue-heavy scenes with questionable writing, the cast (including Joey King, Andrew Koji, Michael Shannon, and Hiroyuki Sanada) keeps things engaging. Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a pair of professional criminals are particularly entertaining, and Pitt exercises his movie star chops with great aplomb. The storytelling is terrific (one of my favorite bits is the tale of Wolf, which is wonderfully executed), even if everything doesn’t quite come together as well as it could.

This is also a gorgeous looking film. Jonathan Sela‘s colorful cinematography is alluring, with a richness that elevates every scene. Leitch is skilled at directing action scenes that are thrilling, and fights that are well choreographed. Even the CGI is exciting.

The film reaches just the right balance between action, violence, and humor, and it’s one that I cannot wait to revisit. From the killer soundtrack to the rapid-fire visual storytelling, there’s a lot going on at all times. If you’re not paying attention, you’re guaranteed to miss something. I feel this one could benefit from subsequent viewings. Plus, it’s been a long time since I’ve wanted to rush back to re-watch a movie the second it ended.

“Bullet Train” is a film that will prove to be an acquired taste. It’s the type of movie that you’ll either love or loathe, with very few landing somewhere in between. It’s illogical, confrontational, and it’s sometimes evident that the film trying too hard, but I found it easy to overlook the flaws because it’s just so damn entertaining. Talk about a nonstop thrill ride.",2023-04-23T06:47:49.029Z,718930,4 stars,0.4694764018058777
garethmb,-1.0,"The latest film in the Predator film series has arrived and the first
under Disney ownership since their purchase of 20th Century Fox. “Prey”
takes a look back in order to move the franchise forward and it does
this by setting in amongst the Comanche community roughly three hundred
years in the past.


The film follows a young girl named Naru (Amber Midthunder) who looks to
become a warrior but in a male-dominated setting, only her brother is
relatively supportive of her ambition and talks about when she will face
a trial which she must endure to show her worth.


At the same time, a Predator has arrived and begins to hunt the local
wildlife. Naru sees evidence of his work and tries to convince the tribe
that the carnage they are finding is not the work of a bear or a
mountain lion as the community believes.


When the nature of the threat manifests itself, Naru must find the
courage and skills to track and face the enemy who threatens to destroy
her tribe.


The film is directed by Dan Trachtenberg and he mixes a good amount of
action along with a very interesting setting and characters to create an
engaging tale.


There are some moments that the FX was not as sharp as one might expect
but the sequences with the Predator are filled with action and suspense
and should make fans of the franchise very happy. The film at times does
require some leaps of faith from the audience but in the end, “Prey” is
a satisfying film that is superior to “The Predator” and rates as one of
the stronger entries in the series and that the franchise is in good
hands for the future.

It will be interesting to see where the franchise goes next as there is lots of material for the franchise to explore, but for now, “Prey” is a refreshing take on the series and one fans should enjoy.

""Prey lives up to high expectations, being the first movie in the Predator saga to come close to or even surpass the original.

Dan Trachtenberg is able to restore the franchise by focusing on a compelling protagonist and the motivational essence of the primary creature, as well as creating one of the most dazzling films of 2022.

Both the cinematography and the score take advantage of the on-location filmmaking to create an almost epic atmosphere, whether through gorgeous wide shots that will leave every viewer amazed or through violent, macabre, exceptionally choreographed action sequences in conjunction with long takes.

Amber Midthunder delivers one of the best performances of her career.

For fans of the saga, horror, and/or action, it's not easy to find something better this year.""

MovieGuys,4.0,"Sometimes it's best to let the dead rest in peace and such is the case, with the much exhumed, Predator franchise. The original has, quite deservedly,become a cult classic. What came after ranges from passable to truly awful acts of grave robbing. 

Prey is not awful. It has wonderful cinematic's and a superficially believable, 18th century world. A world on the cusp of modernisation and change but one that still holds on to, the fading reality embraced by  its native inhabitants. 

Regrettably, that's far as we get. What comes after is a revisionist construct, that does not reflect life, as it was, in this era. Instead we get feminism, at a time when its presence would have been akin, to finding an automatic wrist watch, in an Egyptian tomb. 

If by some miracle you can overlook this nonsensical plot turn, it doesn't get any better. Our hero, a slim young girl, apparently has the wherewithal to take on and defeat, a savage interplanetary killer. A killer, as we can recall from the first film, who chewed through all but one member, of a hardcore team, of special forces mercenaries.

Sure, Arnie's character did use old style tactics, in the end, to defeat the beast. That said, he's a huge, profoundly physical man, cast as someone with no end of combat training and even then he barely made it out alive.

No matter, old world patriarchy defying girl, who has to run like stink from a simple bear the predator easily dispatches, magically gets the job done.

Do I need say more? If utter suspension of disbelief is your thing this just might work for you. My advice, watch or re-watch the original and suspend your disbelief that the spin offs that came after, were ever made.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,5.0,"I guess I have to start by saying that this movie was a lot better than some of the latest entries in the Predator franchise but then, that is not really difficult so it does not say that much. Personally, I think this movie is rather mediocre.

Cinematically it is not a bad movie. I liked the footage for the most part. Story wise, well, for the first half of the movie I found it rather boring actually.

There was some brief scenes with a wolf and later a bear that had some action in it but for the most part the main protagonist ran around moping and whining and trying to pretend to be worthy of being a great warrior. Somewhat unrealistic of course since Hollywood, of course, had cast a woman in the role. Not that I have anything against it per see but at the time this movie is supposed to happen a women, native Indian or not, stayed at home doing the chores whether Hollywood tries to pretend otherwise or not.

As I said, I m still okay with that but she spends most of the time fumbling, stumbling and when a threat comes around she runs and looks scared. Not the kind of great warrior charisma that I was hoping for in the main protagonist.

When it finally starts to get interesting she stumbles into a bloody animal trap and gets caught by a hunting party. The latter which of course is portrayed as the typical Hollywood stereotype of “white man bad”. Minor details like, having your foot caught in that kind of steel trap would render you useless for the rest of the movie, is of course ignored.

The later half of the movie has some action in it at least which is dragged down by the main protagonists moping and the fact that, when she finally has the chance of taking a shot, she just stares stupidly for half a minute and voila, the chance is gone.

On the good side is that the actors are doing a pretty decent job of the not so great script they were given and, as I mentioned, cinematically it is a quite good movie. The action, when it happens, is pretty good if one ignores the Hollywood stupidities and the not so kick-behind main protagonist.

Overall the movie is watchable and, as I wrote, better than previous instalments in the franchise but that is about it.",2022-08-14T09:52:10.573Z,766507,3 stars,0.5808293223381042
CinemaSerf,6.0,"OK. Please explain. Is this just supposed to be ""Pocahontas"" meets ""Predator""? Just because it calls itself an ""origin"" story doesn't mean it needed to be made - and I'm sorry, but I just didn't understand whom this is for. It has none of the suspense or tension of the original Arnie film from 1987, and I kept expecting Peabo Bryson to burst into song at some point as these hopelessly out-gunned/arrowed/tomahawked Commanche - and, to be fair, most of their critter counterparts, seem to be on the menu of this visiting alien creature who has invisibility, enduring strength and some pretty whizzy weapons at his disposal. It is a little bit gory, but no more so that you might see on your latest Blumhouse effort, and to be fair it doesn't hang about - there is plenty of action once it gets started. The acting, however, is really neither here nor there and of course, there isn't the slightest degree of jeopardy as the whole thing sort of lurches along to a quirkily silly ending that made me smile. The effects are pretty old hat and though the human characters are tenacious and courageous enough, the story has just too much of the ridiculous David and Goliath to it. I did wonder why it didn't get a cinema release, but now I have seen it, I reckon I know why. It's watchable enough, but I can't say it's much good or the least memorable.",2022-08-15T11:00:25.963Z,766507,3 stars,0.642318606376648
The Movie Mob,8.0,"**Overall : Prey brings new life to the Predator series, and I hope there is more to come.**

The Predator franchise has been all over the map when it comes to quality, settings, and story. With entries ranging from the incredible 1987 Predator to the awful 2018 attempt, The Predator. Thankfully, Prey shines as the best film in the Predator series since the original. This prequel takes a while to get going as it establishes character motivations and the dangers of the Great Plains. But once it gets going, it just gets better and better! Prey remains faithful to the original, blending horror and action with the elusive alien killer eliminating its prey one by one. But this time, the improved effects and primitive setting make the action more visceral and scary. I could go on and on about how brilliantly the time period raised the stakes, how excellent Amber Midthunder’s heroine was, or how fantastic Dan Trachtenberg’s directing was. Prey returns the Predator franchise to its best form by avoiding the cheese and focusing on the horror of the hunt.",2022-08-19T23:01:05.445Z,766507,4 stars,0.6353018283843994

I came into this movie with some apprehension due to how much I enjoyed the original Predator movie from 1987. My biggest concern was would they ruin the legacy left by the original movie, mostly due to the fact that this is a prequel, unlike the other's in the franchise. However, I was pleasantly surprised.

There is so much to like about this movie, from its beautiful scenery, the highly entertaining action sequences, the stellar acting (led by Amber Midthunder) and how it actually paid homage to the original. The story, much like the original was simple and got straight to the point, and it didn't overcomplicate anything with lengthy or unnecessary dialogue. It also didn't do overboard with the easter eggs and references. I really cant excuse movies which make you pause to show off references to previous instalments of the franchise, even at times when they dont make sense. This movie did none of that which was refreshing.

I highly recommend this movie. If the younger generation was to watch movie first and follow up with the original from 1987, it would not be a disservice at all.

GenerationofSwine,1.0,"So this is a movie about Strong Female Lead, and though Strong Female Lead isn't a hunter and it seems like she hasn't really gone out hunting before, she is the bestest of the bestiest hunters ever.  And the village is wrong for not letting her be the hunter and the lead of the hunting party because not recognizing her untested bestiest is wrong.

And then she goes out and puts everyone at risk to prove that she is the bestest hunter ever... and she is, effortlessly, because she is a Strong Female Lead.

And then Strong Female Lead encounters the Predator, and does something that was actually cool and pretty unique for the series.  But then the Predator has to go kill off the rest of the hunters in her tribe for not recognizing that she is the bestest hunter ever.

Only this is a politically correct movie, you can tell by Strong Female Lead, so the Predator can't be the bad guy, there has to be more of a political message. 

And because of that the plot adds in white people, who are the real evil, the evilist of the evil.  The bestest of being evil.  And they have to show that even when an alien is out there hunting people, white people are worse.

And Strong Female Lead has to prove that she can be even better than them too without trying, and then proves it without expending any real effort.

And out of the blue one of her hunting party (who are now not as evil because there are white men who are eviler) is allowed to do something actually sort of heroic because he doesn't have to be bad at everything now because they white people can be.

And them 'Member Berries.

And at the end Strong Female Lead proves to everyone that she is the bestest at everything, without needing to try, by virtue of just being the bestest of the bestest at everything without even needing to know what she's doing.

It does have the benefit of being quite short, and to be fair to director William Brent Bell, he doesn't hang around once what passes for the story gets going.

""Nope contains extraordinarily immersive technical elements, but the thematic focus raises narrative issues.

Jordan Peele takes full advantage of Hoyte van Hoytema's phenomenal cinematography and Michael Abels' memorable score to create a spectacle worthy of the big screen, but it's the sound production that really elevates the movie to that level.

Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, and Steven Yeun are exceptional, but the latter is tied to an extremely thematic storyline - immensely rich - with little to no impact on the main plot, leaving countless questions unanswered and a divided audience while still affecting the overall pacing.

Humor is surprisingly effective, and the moments of suspense and tension deliver what viewers most desire. A film that deserves multiple viewings and will generate endless debates.""

The Movie Mob,8.0,"**Overall : A big YEP to NOPE!**

Jordan Peele’s creativity is unrivaled! Nothing is typical of anything he does. Even knowing it is an alien movie, he keeps things fresh with surprising twists and eerie tension. Unlike anything I have seen before—there is excellent symbolism through the flashback sequences. I also enjoyed the developing relationship between the main two characters. My only complaint is that the horror and dread so palpable at the beginning fades completely about two-thirds into the film.",2022-08-19T23:13:04.321Z,762504,4 stars,0.5324918031692505
MovieGuys,4.0,"They said it and you wont hear me disagreeing with it. Did I find it entertaining? ""nope"". Did  I feel the story was cohesive and comprehensible, with a clear contextual message? ""nope"". Were characterisations relatable and relevant? ""Sort of"". 

Nope's characterisations are moderately relatable but somehow, also seem to appear oddly misconstrued. The mostly monosyllabic cowboy character, for example, only adds to the sense of ambiguity (perhaps that's the idea).To my mind however, this ploy, if that's what it is, stifles development, of the already ambiguous, story line. The sister, his complete antithesis, is superficially verbose but seems equally, to lack any depth of self awareness.

The only thing I can say conclusively about Nope, is the visuals are  compelling, complex and, at times, almost intricate. This film certainly scores a A+ in this regard. 

That said, so much else is lacking, in particular a clearly articulated narrative, that it failed to resonate, with me. 

In summary, I found Nope a frustrating, dissatisfying watch. Somewhat  reminiscent of M. Night"" Shyamalan films Nope is visually stunning but does  not offer up enough morsels of knowledge, leaving this viewer hungry for more.",2022-08-28T22:46:00.071Z,762504,2 stars,0.5690457224845886

Jordan Peele's 'Nope; comes in with some big expectations due to Peele's previous work. 'Get Out' shifted the paradigm for horror movies, taking a genre which has historically been associated with a temporary experience of thrill and adrenaline, to being social commentaries on society and raising some deeper questions about ourselves in the process of watching his stories unfold.

Nope is no exception, and in fact it can be argued that it attempts to combine story, metaphor and meaning in a more ambitious way than his previous outings. Taking the central theme of 'spectacle', Peele beautifully illustrates its dangers and how we as a society are so obsessed with the spotlight to our own detriment (and even int he worst cases, eventual demise). Choosing a more science fiction approach this time around, Peele does a great job of story telling, and often subvert's out expectations time and time again in the process. Aside from the film's deeper meaning, some of the other highlights come in the form of the cinematography and performances from the central characters (mostly notably, OJ, Emerald and Angel). Peele has managed to create some complex characters which are highly relatable, and the chemistry between the actors is something which will be a lasting memory for me.

However, I do feel that the film does sacrifice plot and narrative in its relentless effort to hammer in the metaphor of the central theme - 'Spectacle'. While I did enjoy each story (OJ and the Animal Alien and Gordie and Jupe), I had a hard time understanding the relationship they had with each other from a narrative point of view. It often felt like two stories could have been played out better without the interference of the other. Other than that I did have some questions around OJ's motivations to tame / kill this animal, the legitimacy of the final impossible shot, the nature and behaviour the animal, and how / if OJ survived (or was this open for interpretation?). The ending of the film also was a slight let down with the death of the animal not being all that grand. This however could also be tied into the overall message of 'Spectacle' as the finale is often not worth the what we expect it to be.

Overall, I think Nope is a very good movie which will probably get better with a few re-watches to fully appreciate what Peele was trying to tell us.",2022-09-07T07:26:25.444Z,762504,3 stars,0.46378520131111145

I thought the acting and writing were fine, and the title was a subtle selection. The odd subplot of the incident with Gordy the monkey reminded me of the movie Magnolia for some reason. I wonder if that film was any kind of an influence on Jordan Peele’s storytelling style?

The entity in this movie is rather quirky and odd as we learn how it operates and its likes and dislikes. I will say no more than that because learning about it is part of the fun, though I am sure it made it too slow moving for thriller fans.

""Thirteen Lives follows the usual formulas of works based on true events, but Ron Howard's honest, non-Hollywoodized direction allows him to efficiently tell one of the most remarkable survival stories of the last decade.

The entire cast is extraordinary, but it's Viggo Mortensen and Colin Farrell who mainly guide the film through all the relevant, claustrophobic plot points in a somewhat heavy viewing runtime-wise. Interesting for viewers with little to no knowledge of what happened, but the question remains as to whether it adds anything truly significant to the documentary The Rescue about the same 18 days of suffering, anxiety, and uncertainty.

Their contributions are solid and fairly undramatic as they allow the chronology to develop and the suspense and pressure to accumulate. It's history - so we know what happens, but somehow that lack of jeopardy doesn't really matter as we follow the efforts of an international team trying to rescue the twelve boys and their coach who have found themselves stuck underground, a few kilometres from the entrance, after heavy monsoon rains struck and flooded the tunnels. Now, of course, the first question might have been for the coach - didn't he look at the weather forecast first? However, now marooned quickly in their dark and claustrophobic environment, Ron Howard takes his time to demonstrate to us all just how this most innovative and challenging of evacuations was planned and executed - none of it without considerable risk to everyone involved. We are drawn into the scenarios, and I felt that I had skin in this game - the story has a palpable immersion (no pun intended) for the viewer. The cast gel well without any stand-out contributions or wordy dialogue, which I think well illustrates the strenuous pressures put on these men, essentially volunteers, by themselves, the families, the authorities and the relentless rain. The subterranean photography works really well in generating a feeling of peril and I certainly shared in that sense of relief at the end...

RalphRahal,7.0,"Thirteen Lives is a deeply moving film that highlights the incredible true story of the 2018 Tham Luang cave rescue in Thailand. Directed by Ron Howard, the movie focuses on the global effort and teamwork that led to the miraculous rescue of a young soccer team and their coach. The performances by Viggo Mortensen, Colin Farrell, and Joel Edgerton are excellent, portraying the bravery and skill of the divers who risked everything to save the boys.

The film is technically outstanding, with gripping underwater scenes and a realistic portrayal of the challenging conditions faced by the rescuers. Howard’s direction keeps the focus on the human element, showing the immense sacrifices and collaboration that made the rescue possible. However, I couldn’t help but feel like something was missing. The movie spends so much time on the rescuers’ perspective that it doesn’t dive deeply into the emotional experiences of the boys and their coach. This lack of focus on their side of the story left me feeling that a key part of the event’s impact was underexplored.

Despite this, Thirteen Lives is still a powerful film that captures the resilience and determination of everyone involved in the rescue. It’s a testament to what humanity can achieve when people come together in the face of impossible odds. While it might not fully explore every emotional angle, it’s a well-made and inspiring story that’s worth watching.",2024-12-14T16:46:37.038Z,698948,4 stars,0.7289962768554688
NancyLDraper@gmail.com,8.0,"By January 2022, the book had sold 12 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books of all time. Almost everyone in the theatre, yesterday afternoon, had read the book and were wondering if the movie could be as good as the book, so in my exit poll, of a dozen, or so, viewers, I asked then specifically, “Did the movie do justice to the book?” Without exception they said it had. (Although one reader thought the movie had a more definitive ending than the book.) Their ratings were 8s, 8.5s and two 10s. When I said that anything I rated over 8 would be worthy of a rewatch, it was unanimous that all of them would rewatch it, some thinking they’d like to read the book, again. So, these people, who came to see the movie, had high standards that they felt were met.

The story is simple but intriguing. There is a whole TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD vibe to it. And there is a wonderful contrast between a purity of soul living within a world of threat and danger. It was refreshing to have a film celebrate innocence. The nature shots of North Carolina are breathtaking. The casting is spot on and the performances are flawless. But the success of the film lies with the lead actor, Daisy Edgar-Jones (a very talented Brit, who earned respect for her talents in another best selling novel adaptation for television, NORMAL PEOPLE). There is a wide eyed innocence about Kya that she captures which, in turn, captivates the audience to invest in her story and her plight. (The only disconnect I had with her portrayal was not her fault but that of the production. For a swamp girl, living off the grid, her personal hygiene and wardrobe were spotless and fitted to perfection. A seemingly unlikely possibility considering her environment.) I would definitely see this film again and am tempted to buy the audible book. I give this film an enthusiastic 9 (beautiful and touching) out of 10.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Daisy Edgar-Jones is really quite good in this adaptation of the Delia Owens story of a young girl left to her own devices in 1950s America. One by one her mother, siblings and finally her father abandon her to bring herself up. She takes to fishing for mussels in order to try to make ends meet, and is generally shunned by her community. Except, that is for her childhood friend ""Tate"" (a good effort too from Taylor John Smith) but when he leaves to go to college, she is exposed to the local Lothario ""Chase"" (Harris Dickinson). Turns out he is a bit of a wrong 'un for her, and when he is found dead at the bottom of a fire tower, she is prime suspect. What now ensues is a trial that provides us with retrospectives of the girl's childhood and her relationships whilst ""Milton"" (David Strathairn) organises her defence for a crime that might not even have been committed! The cinematography is gorgeous, the remoteness and intimacy of her existence is captured really well; as is the sense of isolation from her community as they look upon her as little more than an urchin. Smith portrays a decency to his character (he reminded me a lot of Joe Alwyn) and there are some touching performances from Sterling Macer Jnr. and Michael Hyatt as the closest thing the young girl has to family. Dickinson's accent is all over the shop, but he does manage to convince well enough as the rather duplicitous man who probably deserved his fate - however it actually happened. It is an interesting story, illustrating just how little by way of state infrastructure (or interference) there was in this young girl's life and how that empowered and endangered her in equal measure. DEJ delivers a strong and nuanced performance as the initially illiterate girl who was determined not be put upon and the story has a redemption that I found really fitting.

Steve Parker,7.0,"WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is a movie adaptation of the novel of the same name by Delia Owens. The movie is set in the early 1950s in the fictional town of Barkley Cove, North Carolina. Kya Clark (played by Daisy Edgar-Jones) is a young girl who lives in isolation after she is abandoned by her family. She becomes friends with Tate Walker (played by Taylor John Smith), a local boy who helps her learn how to read and write. When Tate also abandons her, Kya becomes involved with Chase Andrews (played by Harris Dickinson), the town's golden boy. When Chase is found dead, Kya becomes the prime suspect.

The movie begins with the murder, unlike in the book.  In the movie, Kya is arrested and put on trial at the start. The trial is the central focus of the movie, whereas in the book it is a secondary plotline. The movie does a decent job of adapting the book's complex plot and characters for the screen. However, it lacks the lyrical prose of the novel, which is one of the novel's greatest strengths.

Daisy Edgar-Jones gives a breakout performance as Kya. She conveys Kya's isolation, desperation, and hope. The movie is worth watching for her performance alone. The movie is visually stunning, with sweeping shots of the North Carolina marshes. It's a beautiful backdrop for the story. In addition to her relationships with the two men in the story, a black couple also befriends Kya – Jumpin' (played by Sterling Macer Jr) and Mabel (played by Michael Hyatt). Their relationship is one of the most complex and interesting relationships in the movie.

WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is not perfect. The film's pacing is uneven, and it struggles to find the right tone. The murder mystery plot is too convoluted and not particularly interesting. And the relationship between Kya and Chase feels forced and unconvincing. And there is no explanation of what a crawdad is! My understanding is that a crawdad is a freshwater crustacean that resembles a small lobster. They are also known as crayfish, crawfish, and crawdaddies. They live in the swamps battling for their existence – a metaphor for Kya's own battle to survive.

The themes of love, loss, betrayal, and redemption are at the heart of this movie. Kya's story is a moving tale of human resilience in the face of great adversity. The ending is hopeful, though not without tragedy.

Overall, WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is a beautiful but flawed adaptation of a great novel. It's worth watching for the stunning visuals and Daisy Edgar-Jones' performance. But be prepared to be disappointed if you're expecting a faithful adaptation of the book.",2022-08-05T10:01:11.234Z,682507,3 stars,0.5506574511528015

A survival story - on many levels - that tackles heavy trauma, the power of nature, prejudice, hypocrisy, and many other topics in a thematically rich screenplay. Daisy Edgar-Jones ends her breakthrough year with yet another complex performance that convinces viewers to invest in the equally intricate, fully-developed protagonist over a runtime slightly affected by a short period during the second act where it loses some momentum.

A tad too melodramatic for my taste, and the divisive revelation of the final minutes will certainly generate much discourse - personally, it almost ruins the whole work.

The mystery part of the movie almost hides in the background until the film's final moments, focusing on Kya's journey rather than devolving into a mediocre whodunit.

Based on the 2018 novel by Delia Owens, “Where the Crawdads Sing” (2022) is a meshing of “Cross Creek” (1983) with backwoods crime mystery, such as ""Undertow"" (2004), ""Winter's Bone"" (2010) and ""Mud"" (2012). It’s reminiscent of Steve Gerber’s Man-Thing comics of the 70s, just with the swamp monster being replaced by human monsters.

CinemaSerf,5.0,"Well at least this latest Netflix effort gives us some eye candy in the form of the annoyingly ageless Ryan Gosling and a slightly hammy Chris Evans, but the rest of it is derivative even by their standards. We start with a young man being released from prison by ""Fitzroy"" (Tommy Lee Jones) so he can join an elite CIA hit squad. Named ""Six"" (Gosling), his first mission is straight out of the ""Mechanic"" (2011) only it's an erstwhile colleague that he is sent to eradicate. A task that proves remarkably simple but is accomplished not before, luckily for us, he is given a micro chip that illustrates his new boss ""Carmichael"" (an underwhelming Regé-Jean Page) is about as crooked as the day is long. There now ensues a series of long ""John Wick"" style combat scenes as try as this hugely well equipped CIA operation does, it simply cannot capture ""Six"". Desperate times call for desperate measures so ""Hansen"" (Evans) is drafted in to finally do the business by kidnapping the easily accessible niece of the now retired TLJ, and using her as leverage he tries a different tack. Wholesale slaughter follows and along the way some lovely buildings in Prague and Croatia become neat piles of rubble; the local citizens are dropping like flies sending those in the CIA PR department into spasms... Well you get the gist. The always over-rated Ana de Armas sports quite a colourful suit at the start, but as usual her contributions are pretty unimpressive; TLJ is nowhere near his best and the thing lurches on towards a really inevitable conclusion that stretched out the thinnest of plots and showed a really disconcerting image of a CIA completely out of control, running rampage - and that scenario isn't remotely plausible. There is plenty of car-chasing, gunfights and pyrotechnic displays but that's nowhere near enough to compensate for a pretty unremarkable script and an amalgam of stories we have seen done better elsewhere, many times before.

the_blueeyes,5.0,"Seing this as another run to the mill Netflix release should not keep your hopes up. Netflix is where mediocre goes to congreate to the masses.
We have another spy action movie amongst us. Last one before this was Kate, that was another bland action-spy movie.
This offers absolutely NOTHING new to the table. We seen every trick this movie offer before. Over-skilled agents. Clever coreographed fight scenes, Trick tactics, agents with no names, An agency who elimintaes their own agents, expendable kill teams, plenty conspiracies and tons of action.
But i have to say i enjoy Gosling alone in this one. He plays it cool. Its  just shame that he is backed up with a script littered with clichés from start to end.
We also have Ana De Armas who is fast becoming the new Tom Holland that appears everywhere. An actress that is milked trought the Hollywood system and spewed out to never be heard of again some day.

The Gray Man is the result of putting a Fast and Furious movie in a blender with Taken or John Wick and Michael Bay. The outrageous action and super cheesy dialogue try to take itself as a serious spy movie. Don’t get me wrong-it’s not a bad movie. The fight choreography is pretty good, and the Gray Man boasts an impressive A-list cast. It is a decent generic action flick.

garethmb,-1.0,"The God of Thunder returns in Marvel Studios’ “Thor: Love and Thunder” and audiences find that Thor (Chris Hemsworth), has been doing missions with the Guardians of the Galaxy while he works himself back into shape and looks to find a new purpose in life.

Thor has been taking the spotlight in many of the missions and when multiple calls for help arise, Thor opts to go off on his own to address a particular call for help while the Guardians head on their way to help others.

It is learned that a being named Gorr (Christian Bale) has been killing Gods and Thor is eager to put a stop to him before he can do more damage. His mission soon puts him on a collision course with Gorr and The Mighty Thor (Natalie Portman) who being his ex and wielding his former weapon causes more than a few funny and awkward moments.

In a race to save captured children, rally the gods, and defeat Gorr, Thor, and Jane along with Korr (Taika Waititi) and Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), embark on an epic adventure in a race against time.

While audiences have come to expect Marvel films to be epic cinematic events, this film is less on the over-the-top action sequences in favor of establishing new circumstances and challenges for the characters going forward.

While there are indeed action sequences and plenty of VFX, it does not have the action or intensity of several of the past films. What it does offer is a good mix of action and humor with enjoyable characters old and new and establishes scenarios for the MCU going forward.

Bale is very good as Gorr and you understand his motivations clearly as while evil, he has a degree of sympathy towards his character which makes his creepy performance all the more compelling.

The cast works very well with one another and there are two scenes in the credits which open up all kinds of possibilities for the future as we are told Thor will return before the credits even begin to roll.

The film also has considerable music and I joked to myself that Guns and Roses are going to be getting a big check due to their music being used frequently during the film as well as that of other artists which helps make the film an enjoyable outing from start to finish which should delight fans as we wait to see for the next cinematic offering from Marvel.

Manuel São Bento,7.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/thor-love-and-thunder-spoiler-free-review

""Thor: Love and Thunder boasts a bittersweet story about finding peace and love in suffering and pain, without forgetting the necessary thunderous action that reaches its best level in a long sequence surrounded by a breathtaking black-and-white color palette.

Christian Bale stands out with a terrifying performance as one of MCU's best villains in recent years, while Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman share excellent chemistry. Visually distinct and with a unique soundtrack, the formulaic screenplay benefits immensely when focusing on the complex arcs of each character.

Still, the continuous comedy bits - far from the hilarious creativity of the past - deny further exploration, removing emotional value from the third act. The action featuring generic CGI shadow monsters holds predictable issues, and an irrelevant plot deviation only serves as a teaser for future content.

Overall, Taika Waititi succeeds yet again, but this time, he fails to reach the full potential of the premise.""

Nathan,7.0,"After a rocky start, _Thor Love and Thunder_ is able to find its footing during delivering a fun and despondent Thor adventure filled with a tremendous amount of heart.
It is no surprise that this film is far from perfect, and that is not more evident than the beginning of the film. The entire first act feels so disjointed and rushed. You get thrown plot point after plot point and get whipped from planet to planet which results in the viewer not being able to lock in on the story. I really enjoyed the scenes we got from Gorr and Jane during this act, but they felt a little underdeveloped and rushed. The comedy was a little thick during this section, some jokes completely missed, but it was nothing that was overbearing that it hurt the experience. Once the movie enters the second act and begins focusing on Jane the entire gets much better. It is here where you can really see the balance that Taika Waititi brought during Ragnarök with some moments rivaling the best from that film. The ending of this film has some really great action and cinematography, some may argue it's among the best in the MCU. As the movie credits rolled, I was very satisfied to the conclusion of this film and am ready for more Thor action in the future.
The acting all around was excellent in this film, I found the dynamic between Jane and Thor worked much better than in previous films. They had real chemistry on screen, and you could feel the love the two previously shared unearth with each additional scene. There are some really great conversations that dive into their relationship that were done fantastically. Christian Bale was menacing as Gorr, his demeanor was sinister and completely unhinged as he delivered crazy laughs while delivering his villain manifesto. It gave me serious flashbacks to Heath Ledger’s Joker. I just wish we got to see more of him in the film, but the bit we did see was top tier villainy in the MCU.
The music in this film blends with the scenes very well. When the Guns N' Roses guitar starts playing you know it is about to go down and I could not help but smile. While the beginning of this film was bad, I can admit, the ending was so great that it averaged out the movie and made it a very enjoyable experience.

Steve Parker,5.0,"**Thor: Love and Thunder** is a sequel to the 2017 film Thor: Ragnarok. It is written and directed by Taika Waititi and based on, of course, the Marvel Comics by Stan Lee. The film stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Natalie Portman as Jane Foster / Mighty Thor, and Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher.

And the story? The gods are in danger! The God Butcher is coming for them! And only the mightiest of them all can stop him: Thor. But Thor is in bad shape. He's lost his hammer, his friends, and his confidence. He'll need all the help he can get to save the day. He'll have to relearn what it means to be a hero, and Jane Foster will have to become the Mighty Thor.

I was looking forward to this movie. I loved Taika Waititi's direction in Ragnarok, and the cast is amazing. I was hoping for another fun, fast-paced, and humorous film like its predecessor. But unfortunately, Thor: Love and Thunder falls flat. The story is convoluted and slow-moving, and there are too many characters for any of them to get enough development. The humour is forced, and it frequently fails. And the ending is just...Stranger things have happened, I suppose.

I was disappointed in **Thor: Love and Thunder**. If you're a die-hard Marvel fan, you might enjoy it, but if you're looking for another fun and exciting Thor film, I think you'll be disappointed, too.",2022-07-10T08:22:58.350Z,616037,2 stars,0.5759410858154297
CinemaSerf,6.0,"This was my favourite of the Marvel franchises, but boy have we now plumbed the depths. Taika Waititi presents us here with a mess of a film that dumps just about all of the original exciting Norse mythology and legend, and substitutes it with something little better than a cartoon. Chris Hemsworth does try quite hard, and nobody could ever doubt Christian Bale's commitment to his roles - he must have lost half his bodyweight as he portrays the emaciated ""Gorr"". This poor fellow loses his daughter but has hopes that his local god will step in. Nope, as Jordan Peele might have said, and as the evil necro-sword mysteriously appears in his hand, he duly dispatches this thoughtless immortal and thereby vows to do the same for all the rest. When several Asgardian children are kidnapped and taken to the shadowland, it falls to Thor, ""King Valkyrie"" (Tessa Thompson) and the newly empowered - but terminally ill - ""Jane"" (Natalie Portman) to thwart this plan. Along the way, they try to recruit some other gods from different pantheons - notably Zeus (a hammily absurd Russell Crowe) but ultimately it's all down to these three to save the day. There is a bit of humour at the start - and maybe Jane Fonda would have been an useful addition, but for the most part this film is neither one thing nor another with too much romance - a serious illness that just didn't belong in a light-heated fantasy film that treats death as an occupational hazard for the characters; and the need to generate and sustain the supporting characters reduced the impact of Thor to little more than a team player in a red cape. The ending is weak, but frankly no more so than most of the rest of this truly disappointing feature. If you stick right to the end of the credits, you will see that perhaps Hercules is to be the next topic for this character - I can only hope Sir Kenneth Branagh is available. Looks great on a big screen, superb visual effects etc., but Marvel have lost their way with this...",2022-07-11T20:05:19.711Z,616037,2 stars,0.5110479593276978
Chris Sawin,6.0,"To be fair, Waititi has some really funny material in _Love and Thunder_. Everyone in the extremely talented cast looks to be having a ton of fun and the villain is out of this world good. The events of the film feel kind of pointless, especially with repeat viewings. Phase four of the MCU has this aimless direction that is heading towards a ton of projects that no one is really all that excited for. After Endgame and Spider-Man: No Way Home, it honestly feels like the MCU has reached its peak. _Thor: Love and Thunder_ is mostly just a brightly colored filler episode that will likely be forgotten about like most of the _Thor_ franchise.

r96sk,7.0,"As usual for the MCU, <em>'Thor: Love and Thunder'</em> is a good watch. I did want more from it, though.

Chris Hemsworth remains the star of the show, I'm adding nothing new by saying he is just perfect for the role. Tessa Thompson, Taika Waititi and Natalie Portman all make for good support. Christian Bale is also someone I enjoyed, I like the look of his character but kinda felt that I wanted to see more of him - it's like we see a beginning and an end, but part of me feels like we coulda had something in-between.

The special effects are solid, as is the music; even if the track choices aren't the most creative. I probably would've shortened the run time a little, though that isn't anything all that noteworthy to be honest. There are some funny moments in there, which is always something I expect from a Taika Waititi flick.

As for me and my own personal Thor ranking, this  - like the 2011 original (also 3*) - isn't one of my favourites (fwiw, I enjoy <em>'Thor: The Dark World'</em> and <em>'Thor: Ragnarok'</em> (both 4*) way more) but it's still a fun enough time that I'd recommend it.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,3.0,"It appears that disgraced asshat Bob Chapek (not going to link to IMDb for this asshat since his bio there is just corporate gibberish written by Disney themselves, and not updated to show that he got fired) has scared away any form of actual talent from Disney so that even when they do something that is not blatantly woke and preaching it still turns into a turd.

Already in the first scenes I was going what the f… is this? Are they turning the franchise into a comedy?

Thor himself has been turned into a rambling moron. The rest of the Gods are either unbelievable assholes or fat slobs only caring about their orgies or some combination thereof. Most of the movie I was just cringing in my seat.

If they were actually going for more of a comedy movie than an actual Thor movie they failed miserably. The “jokes” where unfunny, unintelligent and just bad. Superhero slapstick at best.

The only character that I found remotely likable and cool in the movie was King Valkyrie. Jane Foster was not too bad either. The rest was just a joke. The portrayal of the mighty God Zeus and Olympus was an affront. The bad guy was not too bad although I would not call him likable of course. He is not supposed to be likable. At least he was not turned into a parody.

It is really a shame because the underlying story is not half bad… if it had been given to someone with actual talent to implement. It is predictable of course but it is okay. If it had only been given to someone who could have turned it into a real Thor movie instead of this failed comedy turd.

I have to admit that I did not have my hopes up very much when starting to watch this movie. Given what Disney has turned into I was afraid that they were literally going to turn Thor into a female and luckily that did not happen. Unfortunately they found another way of ruining the franchise. This movie is nothing like the previous Thor movies. I really liked Thor: The Dark World for example. To me this movie is very close to a franchise killer.

""Persuasion seems to be another typical case of book adaptations: anyone familiar with the original material will struggle to appreciate even the slightest change; those without previous knowledge of Jane Austen's novel might be able to enjoy the film for itself. As someone belonging to the latter group, I found myself surprisingly satisfied.

Despite following all the narrative paths in the most predictable, cliche manner possible, Dakota Johnson's fabulous performance and some unexpectedly humorous interactions are enough to make the viewing rather pleasant.

Far from being innovative or unique, but it still serves as a recommendation for fans of the genre.""

Peter McGinn,7.0,"There are two groups of viewers who profess to hate this movie, and I have some sympathy for one of those groups. The Jane Austen purists are furious about it (“furious purists” - say that three times quickly). The story has been updated — sort of. That is, we find modern language and expressions popping up here and there, but clearly it still takes place in the past.  It possesses a modern sensibility but still resides in the past. 

There is more wit and humor in this version, and I am fine with that. And having Anne talk directly to the camera is something different for an Austen adaptation. I am usually not crazy about narration and voiceover, but again, it is witty and it works for me. If I feel like watching an adaptation closer to the original novel, there are the 1992 and 2007 versions to fall back on, after all. They will always be out there.

Don’t get me wrong; there were one or two places where even I thought they had played too fast and loose with the characters: such as when Anne Elliot embarrasses her brother-in-law in front of a large gathering for dinner by saying he had been interested in marrying her before settling upon sister Mary. That seemed too mean-spirited for the character they were building and we came to know. 

So the Austen lovers are upset in the same way that historians were when most historical movies change history or the real life people involved. I get that feeling even if I don’t share it.

The group I don’t sympathize with are the racists, aka the haters. They sometimes try to shield their racism by talking about “woke” culture, or whatever. But the simple fact that they can’t see past the race and skin color to the individuals’ performances is exactly why it is important to have non-whites playing some of these roles. Where are these hating snowflakes when talking about the thousands of movies over the decades where all roles were played by whites? Wait, what? That doesn’t offend them equally? Big surprise. It is a fine entry in the Austen adaptation collection. Do watch it without prejudice if you can.",2022-08-20T20:06:45.169Z,820912,4 stars,0.6721810102462769
CinemaSerf,6.0,"Eleven year old 'Gru"" is asked by his school teacher what he wants to be when he grows up. ""A super villain"" he retorts - to the derision of his classmates. Little do they know, though, that he has applied to join the ""Vicious Six"" who have, themselves, just dumped their founder member ""Wild Knuckles"". They aren't so impressed when he turns up at the interview but he uses his newly designed glue-gun to escape with their all powerful, emerald encrusted, stone. Now the five are on the warpath as he entrusts the stone to his minion friend ""Otto"", but he manages to swap it for a pebble with eyes so now embarks on a mammoth cycle ride to fetch it back whilst the pursuing villains cause havoc. Luckily, ""Wild Knuckles"" hasn't given up. He kidnaps ""Gru"" to get the stone back, but when he realises that he no longer has it, the two form an unlikely, and quite amusing, partnership to retrieve it. I guess I'm just the wrong demographic for this, because although it hits the ground running and never stops for breath, I just didn't really get it. The yellow ovoid creatures are fun, but hardy the stuff of big screen entertainment and the plot reminded me of the recently released ""Bad Guys"" animation that I didn't much like either. It's my first foray into ""Despicable"" territory, but the slapstick approach to the whole thing will probably ensure it's my last.

I was not expecting anything positive from it, yet it actually pulls through with a fun time. I'd even say it's the best release from the entire franchise.

Steve Carell remains a strong lead for these <em>'Despicable Me'</em> projects, as does Pierre Coffin - the voice of the Minions, of course! Taraji P.

It's all about the charmingly orange-toed mollusc ""Marcel"" who is now living with human ""Dean"" and his grandmother ""Connie"" (who even has a titchy zimmer-frame) in an house that was previously occupied by a couple. Now it transpires that this pair had a fairly lively relationship and when things started to get a bit hairy, he and his extended family at the time would seek safety in the sock drawer. After one such altercation, though, the contents of that drawer were unceremoniously emptied into a bag leaving ""Marcel"" in his current, rather lonely, predicament. Every evening he and his granny watch ""Sixty Minutes"" and it occurs to them that presenter Lesley Stahl might just be able to help the family reunite. What follows now is a thoroughly enjoyable, characterful and engaging little drama that sees ""Marcel"" - quite a shrewd and quick-witted fella - and ""Dean"" set about turning his circumstances into a matter of international significance. Question is - well, will it pay off? Of course there is no jeopardy, it's just a fun story - tinged with a touch of tragedy, that elicits feelings of longing, family, loneliness sure, but also of family, optimism and all set in an environment that is ideal for wandering around the walls after you've stuck your tiny feet in honey.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,10.0,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

With strong themes of friendship, family, and always doing what’s right, there’s so much to love about the poignant and sweet animated mockumentary, “Marcel the Shell With Shoes On.” Everything about this film is simply delightful, from its simple stop-motion animation to terrific voice performances from Jenny Slate and Isabella Rossellini.

Based on the hit YouTube film series from the 2010s, the film tells the story of the tiny shell Marcel (voice of Slate) and the day-to-day life that he leads with his grandmother, Nana Connie (voice of Rossellini). The pair live in a house in the suburbs that, after the couple who used to reside there had a very nasty breakup, is now being rented out as an Airbnb. When human documentary filmmaker Dean (Dean Fleischer-Camp) rents the place, he befriends Marcel, learning that his entire shell family disappeared two years ago. Armed with a camera, Dean decides to help his new pal find his lost clan, shooting a documentary about their epic quest.

It’s a simple story told in an elemental style, but director Fleischer-Camp has created a world of pure joy. Marcel is as cute as they come, a sweet, positive little guy with the sunniest of dispositions. He travels around in a tennis ball, climbs the walls by smearing honey on his feet, uses toenail clippings for skis, and has a “pet” ball of lint. It’s the little things that are so inventive and clever, so be sure to pay attention to the small details. It’s a lot like the scenes where Marcel gets carsick when he rides on Dean’s dashboard: there’s something irresistible about seeing the world through a shell’s eyes, and it becomes an effortless endeavor to find an appreciation for everything in your own surroundings, too.

While this sounds like a movie that’s great for kids, it’s probably better for older tweens (and up). It’s a film that’s more pensive than colorful or action-packed, and there are moments that talk openly and frankly about grief, fear, and death. With the help of Nana Connie, Marcel gains the courage to take risks that are scary but important, and he gains a ton of confidence along the way. The story also has a timely life lesson about the world of social media, and Marcel is given a heavy dose of reality when he learns that many of his online “fans” want to exploit him rather than actually help him find his family.

Just ten minutes into the movie, I was concerned that the eccentricity would wear thin quickly, but it does not. Fleischer-Camp, Slate and Nick Paley’s screenplay is so wise and tender and emotionally touching that even when the story ended, I wanted more. I cannot say enough positive things about this entire project because there are no missteps here. That’s why “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On” is one of my favorite films of the year.",2023-04-23T06:26:14.678Z,869626,4 stars,0.5640360116958618

""The Sea Beast may follow familiar story beats, but Chris Williams still delivers one of the best animated movies of the year. The genuinely impressive animation stands out from the other technical elements, especially considering that virtually every scene includes water.

Accompanied by an adventurous epic score, characters receive efficient, thought-provoking arcs, conveying essential life lessons about understanding other perspectives and shamelessly accepting changes in our personal opinion, in addition to the evident premise of not judging a book by its cover.

Excellent voice work by the entire cast, namely Zaris-Angel Hator. Monster action is immensely entertaining for all types of viewers.

Couldn't recommend it more for a family watch.""

MustachedMovieMan,10.0,"Wow! This is right up there with the Spider-Verse films as some of the best animation I've ever seen! I didn't want to look away from the screen lest I miss some of the amazing visuals. Absolutely beautiful animation. 
Water is notoriously one of the most difficult things to animate well, and the animators of this film make it look easy, like a cakewalk.

Right from the get-go I was swept up into the world, and I absolutely loved the pirate-esque adventure the film starts with.
Great world-building, and great characters – especially of the three leads. Jared Harris absolutely knocks it out of the park as Captain Crow, Karl Urban is excellent as Jacob, and Zaris-Angel Hator does an incredible job as the young Maisie.

I've seen some comparisons being made to other films, and while that's warranted, I look at it as a compliment. _The Sea Beast_ combines some of the best elements of those films and yet still manages to have a fresh and engaging tale.

This film is a whole lot of fun, it's visually beautiful, has likeable characters, and it's got humor to boot. – And, it has a great score by Mark Mancina. I definitely recommend this film.

Also, I can tell you from experience that this is great chaser to Netflix's _One Piece_ 😊

⚠️ It's a ""blink and you'll miss it"" line of dialogue, but a crewmember tells a child that it would be better to fall on the knife the child was just given than to disobey an order from the captain.
If it was an adult talking to an adult, it would have been fine. It was just that the adult was telling a child this that it felt odd and like, ""Uh, wait a minute."" Now, in context, it's a pirate-y threat, which blankets it a little. But it's still problematic and something someone should not be talking to a child about.

viha,-1.0,"In the very first scene on the ship when Jacob and others began talking, I was waiting for somebody to say ""Stop, Cut!"" revealing that it was all just part of a movie set.
But unfortunately, it didn't happen, and they continue talking in such a pretentious manner of speech 🥲

The main idea of this movie is quite common known, and even, to some extent, hackneyed in our time, as it has been used in many other pictures.

The animation is of good quality. But comparing to Disney, Pixar, and other studios, it doesn't stand out. Therefore, I wouldn't emphasize anything in this one.

My main complaint about this movie goes to screenwriters. So many dialogues, logical conclusions, and the overall flow of the entire movie felt like it was written by AI (like GPT). 
It was so boring, so predictable, lacked originality, and the characters seemed as shallow as the relationships between them.
It was hard to believe that it was written by human writers. Which coincidentally aligned with the strike of screenwriters happening during that time.

I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch it, and I am not going to watch it again, otherwise, I will fall asleep.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"After about ten minutes, I was both exhausted and terrified. Was what I had just seen - colourful but frenetic and haphazard going to continue? Well, it does calm down - and continues to quite cleverly interweave the early years and aspirations of this young boy with the openly racist political situation that prevailed in the Southern United States in the early 1940s. From here on in, I am treating this as a provocative and entertaining but entirely speculative drama about this man. Historians always argue about what did happen - or what might have, and I haven't any factual insight to add. On that basis, this is a quickly paced and creatively structured depiction of the main points of the life of Elvis. Austin Butler has an uncanny resemblance. As was often said of Dustin Hoffman, it's a fine line between mimicry and acting, but here I think Butler is more in the latter corner. He puts enormous effort into this portrayal. Physically and emotionally he gives convincingly of his all, leaving us in no doubt as to the talents and raw charisma that drove Presley to sell more records than anyone else. History tells us that he was discovered, and that until his death he had a pretty turbulent relationship with his promoter - Col. Tom Parker (Tom Hanks). Hanks is fine, no better. His make up did distract me, especially as he aged, and his accent isn't the best; but he features surprisingly sparingly even if he is essentially relaying the narrative to us. Virtually all of this focusses on the excellent Butler as he demonstrates the highs and low of this man who ended up craving love and adulation as readily as anyone can crave drugs or booze (though he used his fair share of them too). I could have done with more flesh on the bones of his relationship with his mother and his wife, but the depictions of the parasitic hangers-on who continually bleed him dry leave us with a potent image of a not unintelligent man who brought pleasure to millions with his gyrating, his songs and his personality, but maybe didn't keep that much back for himself. It's planet Baz, so of course it is flamboyant and busy, the musical numbers are fluid and full of energy. Once it settles down it is a vibrant and lively effort that really does fly by and that I really did enjoy.",2022-06-26T22:33:20.232Z,614934,4 stars,0.3370978832244873

""Elvis features a glorious, electrifying, iconic performance from Austin Butler that will deservedly guarantee him all the awards of the year.

Unfortunately, the actor isn't enough to overcome the many technical issues, besides Tom Hanks' massive miscast and the formulaic musical biopic narrative. Baz Luhrmann's style theoretically fits the legendary singer's vibrant aura, and the filmmaker's intention is clear.

Nevertheless, the frenetic, choppy editing and the restless camera movements rather come off as a messy, confusing, headache-inducing atmosphere instead of elements that elevate the overall piece. The unnecessarily hefty doesn't help.

I was hoping to be surprised, but then again, I'm admittedly not the biggest Elvis/Luhrmann fan.""

Jace Bain,-1.0,"Film ruined the career of Elvis Presley. In the 1960s, while The Beatles and Rolling Stones were airborne across America, he was caught in a trap: starring in over 20 inane film projects. This allowed the rock n’ roll revolution that centered on Elvis to pass him by. Ironically, this story and more were adapted to the screen last month in the biographical film, ‘Elvis’. The picture was directed by Baz Lurhmann (of ‘Moulin Rouge!’ and ‘The Great Gatsby’ fame) and stars newcomer Austin Butler as our favorite jailhouse rocker. It spans Presley’s career entirely, but with a rigorous focus on the abusive relationship with his manager, “Colonel” Tom Parker, played by Tom Hanks.

The conspiracy theorists have been right all this time. Elvis Presley is alive and well, but young, thirty, and goes by the name of Austin Butler…or at least that’s what I saw on the screen. I can’t praise Butler enough, let alone give him the justice he deserves in this paragraph, so I recommend you keep an eye out for him this next awards season. I am of the adamant opinion that there are three different Elvis Presleys: 50s rock star, 60s movie star, and 70s icon. All three act and move so, so unalike, and Austin understood and played them all. The movie is almost sequenced in this way: giving all three Elvises (Elvi?) their own hour to portray themselves. Similar praises are in order to Helen Thompson, who plays Elvis’ mother, Gladys Presley, and Alton Mason who plays Little Richard, who I wish we would’ve seen more of. The first quarter of the movie is set in the late-1950s, around Elvis’ rise to fame, and a majority of these scenes, especially the few that have Elvis and Gladys conversing about what lies ahead for the both of them, are so tonally gripping and devastating. Every director has a style, whether that be the calculated darkness of Alfred Hitchcock or Michael Bay’s explosions-a-plenty. Baz Luhrmann’s is simply vehement extravagance. I can’t praise his art direction throughout the film enough. Whether it’s the set design, costume design, or the way Austin melts the camera lens whenever he’s on-screen, Baz Luhrmann’s presence is always intensely felt, especially if you’re familiar with his past work. Luhrmann also co-wrote the screenplay, which continues to make me feel as though he was the perfect man for this job.  While your ‘Bohemian Rhapsodies’ will play ‘Another One Bites The Dust’ at the drop of any hat, ‘Elvis’ earns every music queue. It doesn’t just use the music, the film reexamines it. Tones in goofy, throw-away songs, like ‘Cotton Candy Land’ and ‘Power of My Love’, are completely overhauled and turned into life-defining theme songs for these real life characters. New songs, such as ‘Vegas‘ by Doja Cat, ‘Tupelo Shuffle‘ by Swae Lee with Diplo, and ‘Let It All Hang Out‘ by Denzel Curry also have this same sense of extravagance, electrifying every scene they’re in. One track that I thought was used beautifully and like never before was the iconic ‘Unchained Melody’, which had the audience ready to sob on the theater floor every time I saw the film on its opening weekend.

Truthfully, there was not much that I didn’t overwhelmingly enjoy. At around two hours and forty minutes, the runtime may be a little much for the average viewer. I’ve come to the determination that, yes, it’s long, but not too long. Nothing in the almost three hours could be lost without the story (and the emotional significance of its payoff) being affected drastically. The story flows like a puzzle, with every piece being important to understand the full picture. Baz states that there’s a four-hour cut somewhere in the archive and while he says it will most likely never see the light of day, I believe it. When it comes to time, though, I hate that we didn’t spend more time in the period where Elvis was forced to make those truly terrible films of the 1960s. You can feel the importance of this wasted time in Elvis’ life, but it’s not explicitly shown and might leave those unfamiliar addled. Our introduction to Elvis’ longtime wife, Priscilla Presley, was quite weak as well, as we never really see them meet. She’s just kind of…there. Sure, she’s not integral to the main story (that of Elvis and the Colonel), but not having your two romantic leads meet is surely a bold choice. Tom Hanks as Tom Parker is something I would have portrayed differently as well. I’ve seen a lot of people online refer to him as “cartoonish” and, when I saw the film with ‘Sabor Latino’ host Cristopher Loya, he could only compare Hanks’ performance to Jared Leto’s ridiculous portrayal of Paolo Gucci in 2021’s laughable ‘House of Gucci’. I have to agree. This cunning, evil businessman should have been lurking in the shadows of Elvis’ story, not ridiculously running around and laughing through halls with a cane. I feel like I’m watching Cesar Romero’s Joker compared to Heath Ledger’s. This is not to say it’s a terrible performance, which it isn’t, but simply succeeded in portraying a different idea than I would have liked it to.   

Elvis Presley means so many different things to so many different people. As a man, he is portrayed truthfully here, with very little being held back. The climax of the movie, based around Elvis’ 1968 NBC television special, often referred to as “The Comeback”, shows the man grasping with mortality and relevancy with the undervalued song, ‘If I Can Dream’. This scene specifically says a lot about how the film and its crew feel about Elvis Presley, whether it’s the tears in Austin Butler’s eyes as he belts out the song, the camera’s intricate zoom on the Colonel watching Elvis from the background, or Baz Lurhmann’s distortion of the background with magazine articles, showing us how the world thought at the time. It’s almost an enhanced stage play with thick, thoughtful dialogue throughout. I very much enjoyed the film and it places high in my favorites of all time. While Elton John’s ‘Rocketman’ might still be my reigning, defending biopic champion, second place isn’t too shabby at all. The powers that be all came together to make this one, great cinematic experience that the entire family will be able to enjoy and appreciate. I recommend you do it while the film is still available in theaters across the globe.",2022-07-31T22:43:25.158Z,614934,2 stars,0.39604631066322327

But a biopic is only as great as the leading actor carrying this film and I glad to report that Austin Butler absolutely nailed this role. Fantastic through and through.

Peter McGinn,7.0,"I found this movie to be fairly entertaining and, if mostly accurate, how much damage a con man can do to a performer’s career, and indeed their life, if they are unscrupulous and greedy. I had heard that the man who called himself Colonel Parker had forced songwriters to give Presley writing credits before he would let him perform their songs, but I had never dug deep enough to learn how badly he was duping his own client and supposed friend.

And as often seems to happen with celebrities with fame and money, drugs appear to have shortened Elvis’s life. With early rock stars or those living that lifestyle, overdoses often did them in. But With the likes of Judy Garland and Elvis, it was prescription drugs that slowly caused their lives to ebb away. A sad story in many ways. I would have liked to see him more as a father and husband. But the acting, writing and the story of his musical journey was enough to keep me interested. It was funny, but when they related at the end the postscripts to the lives, their description of Colonel Parker’s final years seemed designed to elicit pity or ”serves him right.” But in a weird way, I wonder if her was content powering down his life in Vegas gambling his fortune away.

Axel,6.0,"Elvis (2022) is a biopic that offers an insightful glimpse into the life and talent of one of the greatest performers to ever grace the stage. Austin Butler delivers an outstanding performance as Elvis, effortlessly capturing the essence of the legendary artist from start to finish. His portrayal is likely to earn him much-deserved accolades during the awards season.

However, the film does have its flaws. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, it's a bit too long for comfort, and towards the end, it starts to lose its momentum, leading to an unsatisfying finish. Additionally, the film's over-the-top and extravagant visual style, while suitable for the musical numbers, can become burdensome and distracting during the quieter moments.

Unfortunately, the film's narrator and one of its most prominent actors, Tom Hanks, gives a surprisingly disappointing performance. His prosthetics often look like they're falling off, and his accent is distracting and difficult to get used to. This issue is compounded by the fact that he's the narrator, which means he's present throughout much of the movie, causing some frustration and annoyance.

Despite its shortcomings, Elvis is still an enjoyable and informative movie that provides an excellent window into the life of a musical icon. While it may not be perfect, there are certainly enough high points to warrant a watch, making it worth a solid 6/10 rating.",2023-02-23T17:54:12.654Z,614934,3 stars,0.6761062145233154
Ahmetaslan27,7.0,"**amazing, beautiful and shocking movie**

 I didn't expect that I would like the movie in this way because I have no interest in the singer Elvis Bresley because I have never heard his songs. All I know is that he is a rock and roll legend. I had no interest or any attachment to this character, but the movie made me admire his true personality.

That was so magical with all the beauty of the story and it really hurt my heart. Biographical films about rock stars have something traditional. You see at the beginning of the movies as the hero of the true story he was humble and then you see his rise to the top and his attachment to drugs and his love for women until the end. This movie has this characteristic as well, but the film's direction by Baz Luhrmann was frankly excellent as it had a rhythm The film is fast-paced. It is difficult to take a break between the movie because the rhythm of the film was fast.

Everything was fast until I realized that the story of Elvis could be turned into a series with several episodes, 7 or 8, but when the story was turned into a movie, the events of his life story were transformed into an incredibly fast frame. My eyes were inside the movie as a zoom frame mode following the movie from the first scene to the last scene curiously.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"""Nancy"" (Dame Emma Thompson) rents an hotel room and a younger man ""Leo"" (Daryl McCormack) so she can tick off - quite literally - some of the sexual activities that she never experienced during her rather mundane 33-year marriage to the recently deceased ""Robert"". He arrives, she is bowled over, and the next ninety minutes sees them explore the character traits and bodies of the other. It is entertaining. There is a nervousness from this older woman - a former teacher - who wants to experiment with some of the most basic aspects of sex but who cannot stop herself over-thinking, vacillating and using just about every diversionary tactic in the book to avoid actually getting it on with her hunky and charming partner. For his part, ""Leo"" comes across as a decent, sincere employee who is patience personified. Will anything come of it? The narrative is split into four meetings - their first, the nervous; their second more confident but still with plenty of nerves to overcome then the third. That is where the film starts to wobble a bit. A series of scenes that display a conflict that seems to have been artificially created to add drama. It wasn't necessary, and somehow that undermined the concluding meeting which was certainly the most visually raunchy and honest. This is a film that is here for us to enjoy. It does touch on an whole range of issues, but in an almost tangential fashion - there is no pontificating. It suggests we consider the attitudes society has about age, sex, loneliness, fulfilment, sexuality, family, judgemental behaviour, tolerance, friendship, love - you name it. It is probably too simplistic a story to offer any definitive solution to the imponderables of the ""sex industry"" but it does present us with food for thought. There is a chemistry between the two that at times makes you squirm, then laugh, then want to bang their heads together, whilst it addresses taboos that makes little sense when laid bare on a big screen, but which resonate profoundly - if not aways rationally - with the characterisations played before us.

r96sk,9.0,"What a terrific film!

If you had told me the general gist of <em>'Good Luck to You, Leo Grande'</em> out of context, I'd have predicted a dull and dreary 90 minutes or so were ahead of me. Thankfully, the film itself is a delight. Before watching, I only knew of the poster and thought it was strictly a sex comedy, so was expecting a silly, fast-paced, if forgettable, age gap romcom.

The film is, thankfully, much more than that. Emma Thompson is just brilliant in her role, while Daryl McCormack is superb from beginning to end - cool to see him in a larger role than in (the awesome) <em>'<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky_Blinders_(TV_series)"">Peaky Blinders</a>'</em>. It's perfect casting, the two absolutely nail their performances and are a joy to watch onscreen together.

The one location (for the most part) doesn't hamper things, if anything it only adds to events. I was particularly impressed with the dialogue, especially the more comedic moments. There is one line involving Rolf Harris which was, perhaps, a misstep but all in all it's pretty sharp. It has a story to tell and one that I think it portrays very nicely.",2023-02-15T03:36:04.230Z,758330,5 stars,0.7260841131210327
CinemaSerf,7.0,"The thing about adapting a short story for cinema is that we tend to get a great deal of padding to get it to the duration. This film is certainly guilty of that, with the first half hour spent on way too much character establishment that really has very little to do with the gist of the story. Once it does get going though, it's a cleverly crafted and well put together scary movie centred around ""Finn"" (Mason Thames). Bullied at school, he is protected by his friend ""Robin"" (Miguel Cazarez Mora) until he disappears. He isn't the first child to disappear either, indeed five from this small community have gone missing over the last few weeks. ""Finn"" is walking home after school when he encounters a man who has dropped his groceries. Offering to help, next thing he knows he is in a grubby basement with only a soiled mattress and a disconnected phone on the wall. His mask-clad captor - who has something of the ""Joker"" about him - insists he is in no danger, but the phone on the wall starts to ring and the callers - the other five victims - warn him otherwise, and help him to try to best his nemesis. There are one or two jump moments, but mostly there is an effectively accumulating sense of menace well fuelled by confident efforts from Thames and his sister ""Gwen"" (Madeleine McGraw) who might have inherited her mother's ability to see the future in dreams - a skill that may prove vital in helping the police save her brother from certain death. There are violent undertones, but very little actual violence is shown as the young man comes to terms with some of his own demons and to try to escape. The last ten minutes redeem it well, and there is something distinctly satisfying about the conclusion. Scott Derrickson has provided us with one of the better Blumhouse dramas of recent years that is sure worth a watch.",2022-06-25T06:24:38.927Z,756999,3 stars,0.4628555178642273
Chris Sawin,7.0,"With supernatural dread lifted directly from the likes of _Stir of Echoes_ and _The Sixth Sense_, _The Black Phone_ features a breakthrough performance from Madeleine McGraw while Ethan Hawke’s hauntingly memorable turn as The Grabber is felt in a hair-raising sense; like someone who has unknowingly snuck up behind you and waits in your peripheral for that dramatic reveal. _The Black Phone_ is a solid, pulse racing horror film that packs a punch, but seems like the type of film that simply won’t be as delectable on repeat viewings.

""The Black Phone carries a horror premise with a supernatural touch full of potential, but it plays too safe by betting on a narrative that's too simple, predictable, and repetitive.

Scott Derrickson elevates his work with a distinct style, and the fact that the main focus belongs to the protagonists development rather than on generic jumpscares pleases me.

Mason Thames and Madeleine McGraw are, without a doubt, the most impressive elements of the entire film, delivering two of the best performances by young actors of the last decade. Ethan Hawke is underused, just like his unexplored character.

I recommend it, but personally, I expected something more creative.""

Nathan,8.0,"The Black Phone is a paranormal abduction thriller that balances the tension/despair of being trapped and the ghost elements very well. The movie does a great job setting up the main characters in the beginning that gives you a relationship with them and genuine desire for them to succeed. There are a few plot points that are a little questionable, but are they are minor nitpicks and didn’t pull me out of the story too much. The performances all around were great. Ethan Hawke does fantastic in his limited screen time. He conveys the mental state of the Grabber with such nuance, it really makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. The children do very well too, especially in the more emotionally heavy scenes. A few of the classmates performances in the beginning were a bit awkward.  Overall, I had a great time with this movie and it is a testament to the directors and writers that they could adapt such a creative thriller from a short story.

THE BLACK PHONE is suspenseful and scary without the need to have onscreen violence (the violence is mostly off-screen). The cast is excellent, particularly Thames and McGraw, who both give standout performances. Thames is particularly convincing as the terrified boy who is trying to make sense of the situation he's in. Hawke is also chilling as the killer, though his character is not as fleshed out as I would have liked.

garethmb,-1.0,"The digital magicians at Pixar have returned with an origin story of one of their most famous characters. “Lightyear” opens with an explanation that Andy from “A Toy Story” was given a toy based on his favorite movie in 1995 and that this is the movie upon which the toy was based.

With that explanation out of the way, the film centers on a giant ship deep in space that encounters a planet and awakens Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear (Chris Evans) to investigate. Along with a fellow ranger and a recruit, Buzz scopes out the planet only to discover it is hostile and makes a hasty exit from the planet. Unfortunately, in doing so their ship is damaged and they are left stranded on the planet and forced to establish a colony.

Years later Buzz is about to undergo a test flight based on a new fuel that the colony hopes will replicate their previous source and will allow them to travel at the insane velocities needed to cover millions of light-years.

Things seem to go as planned until a critical failure and Buzz learns that his four-minute flight actually covered several years on the planet. Undaunted Buzz tries again and again and returns to find his friends aging, having children, and passing away with only his robotic cat Sox (Peter Sohn) to keep him connected to his past and assist him.

While this would make for an interesting enough film it is actually just the setup to the larger story which involves a hostile Robot army and an evil menace named Zurg who threatens Buzz and his hastily assembled team of volunteers to save the day.

The film has amazing animation and all the humor and charm that one associates with the best Pixar films and is not above giving the audience an emotional tug here and there along the way as I can remember more than a few Pixar films that caused audiences to tear up.

Since this is the first of the last three Pixar films to make a cinematic release it would be easy to say that it is a return to form for Disney/Pixar but I would say that is an understatement as the film mixes humor, action, and interesting characters to form a very enjoyable and engaging adventure which is one of the most satisfying Pixar films in recent memory and one every bit worthy of their name.

It will be interesting to see what the future holds for this crew as I would very much like to see Buzz and his crew return for new adventures soon as “Lightyear” is a new Pixar classic that the entire family will love.

Angus MacLane doesn't deviate from the studio's well-known formulas, delivering a narrative without notable deviations from the most predictable, safest path. Except for an unnecessary, overly complex twist for the target audience in the third act, Buzz Lightyear and his team take viewers through space on a remarkably immersive audiovisual journey.

The voice cast is extraordinary, most notably Chris Evans - born to play captains - and Peter Sohn - non-stop hilarious as the robotic cat Sox, Disney's most popular new toy-to-be.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Just like in ""Alien"" (1979) a ship's computer wakes some of the crew mid-trip when it detects an uncharted planet. Space Rangers ""Buzz"", ""Hawthorne"" and a rookie take the ship down for a look, but are soon facing some hungry plants and big bugs. He attempts to escape, but the ship (the ""Turnip"") clips a mountain top and crashes, destroying their power crystal. He determines to find a way to replace it - but each time he tests it out, his off-world moments become 4 years for those left behind, and so his repeated attempts to get them all home safely merely see him stay the same age as his companions grow old, marry, have children - grandchildren, even - then die. It's on return from one of his tests, with a functioning power source designed by his auto-cat ""Sox"" - that he discovers their settlement is being besieged by the robot soldiers of ""Emperor Zurg"" and he, together with his cat and an enthusiastic youth training team must destroy the enemy ship and save the day. Director Angus MacLane did pretty much everything here and though it isn't a bad animation, it could possibly have been doing with a few more objective eyeballs to keep it sharp. The story starts off strongly with some fast-paced dialogue and a bit of fun with the inhabitants of their new home. Quickly, though, it becomes a bit repetitive and starts to drag. Sentimentality creeps in a bit too much and as the plot unfolds, it does become a bit harder to establish just what this film has to do with ""Toy Story"" (1995) for which it is supposed to be a prequel (the plot towards the end reminded me of ""Guardians of the Galaxy II"" from 2017). The conclusion doesn't fit at all - indeed, I wondered if this were merely the first of a few films that might, eventually, explain how ""Buzz"" ended up as the new favourite of ""Andy"". The production is good, but that is no longer anything to shout about with Disney/Pixar - it is what they do. This needed to build more on why we cared about ""Buzz"" in the first place, and it doesn't really manage that. It picks up in the last fifteen minutes as the messages of teamwork and collaboration start to flow through the narrative but is really too long. It is still worth a watch on a big screen to appreciate the colourful visual effects.",2022-06-20T07:52:02.706Z,718789,3 stars,0.5398165583610535

With that out of the way, I really enjoyed this film, the exploration of a new world was really well done. I liked the time traveling elements that were presented, borrowing some from Interstellar, and it brought some really sad moments that nearly drew a tear from me.

As a horror fan, I am much more interested in movies that deliver intense tension leaving audiences at the edge of their seat. While this movie does attempt to deliver on that premise, it does so in a way that is incredibly long and dragged out. By the time the movie really had me hooked, it would cut away to a different scene and completely ruin any resemblance of momentum it had going for it. This results in a very uneven viewing experience that left me bored more often than not. The performance by Maika Monroe was brilliant and she does such an excellent job of portraying loneliness throughout the film. Even though she was surrounded by her husband and friends the sense of isolation this movie and Monroe builds is entrapping. The audience can genuinely empathies with her, creating a wonderful protagonist to root for. Despite the uneven story and the slowness of the entire film, the ending did leave me incredibly satisfied.

Watcher is a masterclass in subverting audience expectations. It starts out as a fairly generic ""my neighbor might be a serial killer""-flick, but ends up being a lot deeper than that. What makes it stand out is how it manages to make the audience question if Julia's suspicions are actually grounded in reality or just misinterpretations of coincidences the longer the movie goes on. You can kind of see both her perspective and that of the people that doubt her, which is something I have very rarely seen done well in a film of this genre.

There's a major twist in the finale, which I found bold and impressive. It's unfortunately followed up by a pretty generic trope that heavily negates the impact of the previous scene. I feel like the writers chickened out in the very last minute of what could've been a very unexpected and memorable turn of events.

Well it turns out she is a bit of a miraculous conception from the ""Lockwood"" dynasty that co-founded the original park with ""Hammond"" and is very much on the radar of corporate megalomanic ""Dodgson"" (Campbell Scott) whose company is devising super-engineered locusts to devour great swathes of crops across the United States that are not grown from their own brand of seed. This is where ""Sattler"" (Laura Dern) comes in. She is convinced of this dastardly plan, but must compare the DNA of one from his lab with one they secured in the wild so she can prove it. Her plan enlists the help of old pal ""Grant"" (Sam Neill) and with the help of their intellectual nemesis ""Malcolm"" (a suitably contrarian effort from Jeff Goldblum) they secure an invitation to the company's sanctuary in the Italian Dolomites. Meantime, the young girl is abducted from her wintry home, as is the baby of velociraptor ""Blue"" and so Pratt and Howard have to track them down, and that takes them on some quickly paced, but hardly original, set piece adventures where they meet pilot ""Kayla"" (DeWanda Wise). She chips in to help them in what now reminded me of aspects of the Brendan Fraser ""Mummy"" films, before they also end up in the Italian mountains. Can they team up and thwart the cunning plan? The problem with this, is that there are just way too many characters and too many weakly constructed threads to the story going on. It's all too diffuse and serendipity in the last hour or so just takes far too great a hand in the way the narrative combines and develops. The dinosaur effects are still amazing, but oddly enough I felt them less effective than in previous iterations - there just aren't enough scenes that feature them and when they do, they are just under-used. Pratt is always good value for me, but here he looks out of sorts and hardly features at all; Scott just doesn't cut it as the malevolent baddie (though could his character be the same guy who tried to buy the specimens in the first film?) and Sam Neill relies too much on his bemused facial expressions - indeed his best work on this is pretty much all included in the trailers.

""Jurassic World Dominion is a massive disappointment on virtually every level. With an incredibly captivating premise, Colin Trevorrow ignores the fascinating years of mankind trying to deal with the chaos of dinosaurs repopulating Earth, opting instead to write a generic, formulaic, surprisingly tedious screenplay.

In addition to the lousy character treatment, the cast is divided into two storylines focused on nonsensical, bland rescue and espionage missions, placing dinosaurs on the back burner during the excessively long runtime.

Action sequences reach drastically low entertainment levels, sometimes imperceptible due to erratic camera work and choppy editing.

Chris Sawin,4.0,"With _Jurassic World Dominion_, a _Jurassic World_ film where dinosaurs are now free and interacting with the modern world shouldn’t feel this long-winded or this tiresome. There are a few action sequences that are worthwhile and Jeff Goldblum has a few great one-liners (“You made a promise to a dinosaur?”), but the film is a monumental disappointment overall.

The film has already made over $415 million at the worldwide box office, so the interest in the franchise is still there. But the chemistry between the cast is almost non-existent and it feels like the film is running on fumes as it tries to offer something new from what is otherwise dried up fossil fuel. If the _Jurassic Park/Jurassic World_ franchise is to continue, it desperately needs to go in a refreshing and unseen direction.

r96sk,7.0,"<em>'Jurassic World Dominion'</em> is far from perfect, if just about entertaining to watch... kinda.

I'm not fully convinced by it but I do think there's enough in there that's worth watching. There are too many characters, even main characters with the original trio and the newer duo both involved equally. With that said, I do like 'em. It's pleasant to see Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, while Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are a good pairing.

Still, I wouldn't say any one character stands out here. They all make their presence known, though I'm struggling to remember any great moments individually - that's due to the aforementioned surplus. The rest of the cast, fwiw, are all fine - Mamoudou Athie sticks out most in that regard.

The run time is overlong, in my opinion. I personally could've done without 30 or so minutes and I wouldn't have felt it was missing anything. The story itself isn't all that fresh, as in I feel like I've seen this sorta thing before (I mean, Biosyn... how creative!), but the barrage of dinosaur-centric action probably just abouts tips it over into a positive rating for yours truly. Could easily be lower, though.

I'd love for this to be the end of the Jurassic franchise (is there much more to tell?) but there ain't no way Amblin/Universal are leaving this IP to collect dust, let's be honest.",2022-07-13T16:35:31.330Z,507086,3 stars,0.6682164072990417
Peter McGinn,6.0,"So after watching the first four movies in this franchise (three of which I had seen more than once, I finally watched this most recent effort. There are similarities and differences between Dominion and the earlier ones.

It held some of the usual elements: a child for us to care when they placed her in danger; the ability of the heroes (even the child) to outrun dinosaurs under a blind panic; walking dinosaur food, also known as bad guys; and references to the original theme park that started it all. They outdid themselves this time - keep an eye out for the Barbasol shaving cream canister.

Of course, there are plenty of differences also. Parts of it weren’t even recognizable as part of the franchise. They juggle plot lines around the dinosaurs, the ethics of genetic engineering, a child clone kidnapping, industrial malfeasance, and what for me was the most interesting subplot and most closely tied to the original film: the struggle for humans and dinosaurs to co-exist under the new planetary paradigm. 

Another difference is that there are two romances developing throughout the film.

An improvement is the return of characters we know well: Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant are back, and Ian Malcolm is present long enough to get in a few of his witticisms, unlike in the last movie.

So ultimately I found Dominion to be entertaining enough to stick with it, though the aspects that might have been intended to make me think just sort of got in the way.",2022-08-07T14:50:09.229Z,507086,4 stars,0.4443283975124359
The Movie Mob,7.0,"**Not as bad as reviews say, but go in with reasonable expectations.**

As the conclusion of the Jurassic World trilogy, it, unfortunately, had similarities to Rise of Skywalker. A lot of things were going on. Some fun moments. Great nostalgia with the legacy cast. Lots of dino action. But it also felt like they had so much going on that they ran out of time to highlight characters and make us care. I will always love Jurassic Park, so this movie got a little boost in rating because of nostalgia from me.",2022-08-20T00:27:16.145Z,507086,3 stars,0.539442777633667
JPV852,2.0,"Wow. Genetically modified locusts. I hope Universal got a discount on the screenwriters... On the plus side, some of the effects were okay. The hero shots of the two franchises (Jurassic Park and Jurassic World) looked good. Otherwise this was a slug to get through and felt like the old guard and new guard were phoning it in.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,4.0,"Well, the dinosaur special effects are quite decent. Unfortunately that is more or less the only reason to watch this movie.

I really do not understand how the Hollywood idiots can decide to spend loads of money on special effects but not bother to get a decent story/script writer? I mean come on, the story of this movie is just another thirteen on a dozen “big companies are bad” story with dinosaurs thrown in.

The story is convoluted to say the least and there is as much logic in it as you would expect from a Hollywood writer hack. Things more or less just happen and the “heroes” fight off one dinosaur attack after another on their way to the bad gay without ever tiring. And why the hell can Hollywood never produce a movie where the “heroes” doesn’t just stare like idiots at something until they are screwed?

Idiotic nonsens like being able to train a dinosaur to home in on someone like a heat seeking missile and chase them forever after having pointed a laser marker on them for a couple of seconds is also the usual unintelligent Hollywood nonsense that just ruins a movie for anyone with anything like average intelligence.

They brough back some of the old characters but they do not really help. The mostly act like they cannot wait to get paid and get out of there. Jeff Goldblum is his usual climate cult procelyte. I did not really like him in the first movie and he is even worse in this one. The bad guy totally lacks charisma. The only character I really liked was DeWanda Wise as Kyle Watts.

It is really a shame to see another franchise destroyed by today’s Hollywood morons. I’ve been a dinosaur fan since I was a kid and when the first Jurassic Parc came out with real, life like dinosaurs it was just wow. But now, not even the special effects can save this movie. It is not a good movie, plain and simple.",2022-10-23T12:36:12.701Z,507086,2 stars,0.5951403975486755
Wuchak,6.0,"**_The Jurassic Park protagonists come together in Marvel’s Savage Land, minus Ka-Zar_**

As dinosaurs freely roam the Earth, Owen & Claire (Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard) seek to find their kidnapped adopted daughter (Isabella Sermon), which takes them to Malta and then a remote dinosaur preserve in the Dolomite Mountains of northeastern Italy. Meanwhile Ellie Sattler and Alan Grant (Laura Dern and Sam Neill) have serious concerns about the remote facility wherein they reunite with Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum).
   
""Jurassic World: Dominion"" (2022) isn’t great like the previous “Fallen Kingdom” (2018) and is arguably the least of the second trilogy. There are some Indiana Jones elements in the Malta segment and James Bond bits at the technologically advanced lair in the mountains, both of which I appreciate.

Yet I strangely never bought the characters as real people. They always struck me as actors performing according to a contrived script, which tries too hard to check the diversity boxes. Still, there’s certainly enough here to entertain if you’re interested in a dinosaur-oriented sci-fi adventure.  

The film runs 2 hours, 27 minutes, with the Extended Version running just over 12 minutes longer (I viewed the latter). The primary shooting locations include British Columbia, Malta, Hawaii and the UK (Pinewood Studios).

Axel,5.0,"Jurassic World Dominion fails to impress as a dinosaur movie, as the plot seems to be a poor choice. The dinosaurs are present but not the main focus, giving the impression that they are only there to extend the franchise. Even the inclusion of Alan Grant seems to be more for nostalgic purposes than contributing to the story. Chris Pratt's character also appears to be underutilized and serves more as a prop rather than a leading character.

The camera work in the movie is particularly shoddy, with cuts from one angle to another creating confusion, especially in fast-paced scenes like the one in Malta. The depiction of Malta in the movie is also disappointing, with the country portrayed as a dirty, third-world Arabic nation covered in desert sand, which is not an accurate representation of the country. The use of Arabic style music in the background also seems out of place and unnecessary.

Overall, Jurassic World Dominion seems to be a movie that was made to extend the franchise rather than being a well-planned and executed story. It is disappointing that a franchise that should have stopped by the third installment continues to churn out mediocre movies. Although the movie is not a complete disaster, it falls short of being an enjoyable watch. 

Additionally, the length of the movie seems to be excessive, and the dragging plot does not help in holding the audience's attention. The story's predictability adds to the monotony, leaving little to surprise or engage the viewers.

As if to acknowledge the franchise's overreliance on gimmicks and sequels, Ian Malcolm's line, ""Jurassic World? Not a fan,"" serves as a meta-commentary on the movie itself. It is a nod to the fans who have been disappointed by the franchise's recent offerings, and unfortunately, Jurassic World Dominion does little to change that sentiment. 5/10",2023-03-07T19:12:01.467Z,507086,2 stars,0.5583927631378174

jw,2.0,"The premise, as an elevator pitch, might have worked.

With some research, a good script, and some solid acting and direction, this might have been a good, entertaining action flick. But it isn't.

No-one bothered to do a tiny bit of research to make the scenario, the tech, the military babble or insignias at least somewhat OK-ish. The CGI is a the level YT kids do these days, and the story is threadbare recycled fare. Plus, as some complained, too much ""woke BS"" - I intended to go along with some plot elements at first, but it's so coarsely piled on, it becomes unbearable. 
And don't get me started on the ""acting"".

As audience, we are making a deal with the moviemakers. We provide some suspension of disbelief, accept some bits that aren't realistic, and they put in some effort to accommodate us in this regard. 
Unless they are lazy as in this case. Then it becomes insulting how little they think of us.

Action stars don't need to have real acting chops; if they do, it is a very welcome addition, and can mean actual stardom. But the least we can expect is Expendables-level effort.


There is still a niche for old-fashioned save-the-world-action flicks, I'm sure of that. But stuff like this is just a crappy waste of viewer's time.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"Whilst certainly nowhere near his best, this is still quite an intriguing drama from David Cronenberg. It all centres around ""Saul Tenser"" (Viggo Mortensen) who uses his own body to grow (or ""cook"") extra organs which he and his assistant ""Caprice"" (Léa Seydoux) extract as part of rather gruesome, but popular, theatrical performances. Meantime, ""Dotrice"" (Scott Speedman) is reeling from the suffocation of his young plastic-eating son (by his own wife) and so convinces the exhibitionists that an autopsy revealing the internal digestive organs of this most unusual of mutations would make for excellent viewing. Don McKellar (""Wippet"") and his colleague ""Timlin"" (Kristen Stewart) run the government department for organ registration and needless to say they take a dim view on the legality of some or all of these activities... or do they? The concept is interesting and ethically highly dubious but sadly the execution is a bit lacklustre and there is way too much dialogue and, oddly enough here, too little use made of the special effects that are at times quite disturbing to watch and are, no pun intended, rather at the heart of the story. Stewart's very presence suggests her character has a more significant part in the proceedings but her appearances themselves are actually quite sparing which is always a bonus for me! It does take a while to get going, and somehow the ending is all rather underwhelming but it still has enough traces of the director's unique style and imagination to make it worth a watch - once",2022-09-19T20:16:24.989Z,819876,3 stars,0.6876263618469238

""Personally, I believe that cinematic narratives with multiple plot points and questions related to the world itself are too often confused and envisioned as character studies driven by a single protagonist.

Both Olivia Wilde and David Cronenberg complete their movies when the main character fulfills the minimum requirements of their arc, consequently renouncing all other equally significant issues worthy of in-depth exploration. In the case of Don't Worry Darling, one finishes it with an underwhelming feeling from an unsurprising conclusion, while in Crimes of the Future, viewers are left with several questions and interesting, half-developed paths about such a mesmerizing futuristic world.

Neither film explores its own world-building satisfactorily.""

r96sk,7.0,"Not the most enjoyable of watches, it meanders a bit, though <em>'Crimes of the Future'</em> is most certainly interesting throughout.

I tend to find films like this a little hit-and-miss, as I personally find the constant reaching for shock value or just simple weirdness a bit too forced. And this film does that a few times, but to be fair as the run time was ticking by I could definitely feel myself becoming more and more intrigued by events portrayed on screen.

Cast-wise, Viggo Mortensen and Léa Seydoux great together, very good acting and very good chemistry. Don McKellar (just me who sees a Jeffrey DeMunn likeness in his eyes? probably ...) and Welket Bungué are more than decent too. Kristen Stewart and Scott Speedman give solid showings as well.

r96sk,9.0,"What an excellent sequel - I, in fact, like it more than its predecessor.

<em>'Top Gun: Maverick'</em> is fantastic, simply put. I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.

The story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.

Tom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' [unexplained] absence.

Monica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.

The original movie had some seriousness built into it, the sequel I think is closer to a comic book movie. Very similar to the original star wars, especially the action sequence at the end. Just a tad more realistic than black widow, you can clearly see the action comedy style of Marvel movies.

I think a lot of conservatives reminiscing Reagan years would watch it, that should be enough to make it a hit.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"It seems like I have been watching the trailers for this film for years now - and you know what? Yes - it was worth the wait. The film is all about some truly exhilarating aerial photography that culminates in some super dogfighting and a good old dose of nostalgia. Tom Cruise is very much in his element as the ageing - and frequently not afraid to look it - eponymous ""Top Gun"" pilot drafted in by a rather sceptical admiral to train up a new squad for a very perilous mission to destroy an underground uranium enrichment facility. The team arrive - full of hormones - and he must whip them into shape, a task made more difficult by the presence of ""Rooster"" (Miles Teller) who is the son of his old mate ""Goose"" who came to a sticky end last time out in 1986. He also gets to rekindle his romance with bar owner ""Penny"" (Jennifer Connelly) whilst all under the protection of his former wingman, now the poorly retired admiral ""Kazansky"" (Val Kilmer). To be honest, the story isn't really up to much - there are some twists and turns, the script is not without some humour but there is no jeopardy really. We all know what is going to happen in the end. That said, though, everyone is on good form; the pace (aside from the interludes with Connelly which do rather abruptly slow things down a bit) is consistently action packed and the imagery from both inside and outside of these amazing pieces of machinery is not at all repetitive and is compelling to watch. Even the usual gung-ho, ye-ha stuff is kept to a minimum - this is a superior film depicting the US military at it's most competitive, but also at it's most intelligent - and I really quite enjoyed it.

Chris Sawin,6.0,"_Top Gun: Maverick_ is a sequel that is a leaps and bounds improvement over the original film. There’s better acting from the entire cast, more of an emotional attachment between at least two of the main characters in the film, and subtle humor that actually lands. But the film’s constant need to fly in the same flight pattern as the original film comes off as more of a restraint than a fond recollection.

The sequel seems to highlight many of the shortcomings of the original film, which in retrospect seems like something you’d try to avoid. With its record breaking box office during Memorial Day weekend, _Top Gun: Maverick_ is an enormously thrilling sequel with unparalleled action sequences that has proven to be exactly what fans have been waiting over 30 years for.

I never thought, a sequel from 80s hits movie would be exceeding its predecessor. tbh i thought this movie would be suck and will be getting the fate like The Matrix Resurrections and RoboCop remake. But boy i was wrong, this movie is the definition of Awesomeness in Cinema.

Let me start with the Story. This movie doesnt have any complex story and some of it structure if im looking at it, kinda almost the same as the first one. But is it identical? yes? so it means they just copying it? no. what i mean is Peter Craig did take a few ideas from the first movie for a few scene (i think its a homage for the first movie) but the context has alot more meaning than the first one tbh.

Now Scoring, Lorne Balfe did great job for remaking the Top Gun Anthem... Damn it feels good hearing that theme again... and also, i want to applause Onerepublic and Lady Gaga for creating such an awesome soundtrack for the movie

Now lastly for cinematography and visual effect, its probably the first time in my life i got out from IMAX and said ""i paid 10$ dollar for this movie? i feel like i should've paid more. This movie is too good"". The sound design, the real action from fighter jet, the bloodpumping visual. It all works together creating this masterpiece. its been a decade since i feel this immerse on the movie.

Nathan,9.0,"Top Gun: Maverick had a ton of praise when I finally got around to watching it and it did a relatively good job living up to it.

My main two complaints from the original have been entirely corrected in it's sequel: cheesy dialogue and terrible shot selection in the aerial sequences. The script has been vastly improved upon with updated dialogue just all around better acting than the original. There were not corny lines or interactions that felt awkward. The aerial combat sections are incredible, they are done with such precision and purpose. I could actually understand what was on and where the fighter crafts were in relation to each. These raised the stacks and hade me fully invested.

The overall story is pretty great. I loved how the recruits were training for a final ""suicide"" mission, instead of just graduating from the academy. The dynamics between Tom Cruise and his superiors/students were great and felt witty and genuine. The continued relationship with Iceman was touching as they seem to have a real connection that has lasted throughout the years, although I thought his illness and they way they presented it was a bit out of place. My one big complain his Cruises love interest. This plot really has no impact on the story and is just thrown in there for old time sakes. I did enjoy their chemistry together and it was cute to his interactions with daughter. But, I watched the original directly before this and was utterly confused on who she was. It was really odd to have a throw away line in the original be the main love interest in the sequel, but like I said, it did not have a huge impact.

The performances are spectacular in this film. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are standouts and their back and forth is really fun to see, delivering some funny jabs but some series dramatic moments. Jon Hamm was great as a hard ass commanding officer. Glen Powell was a standout as well, his cockiness and rivalry with Rooster was great but complex.

This film is a blast, and I really wish I would have made the time to see it in theaters. I really enjoyed this and I am definitely not one who fancies these types of films, but it captured me.

GenerationofSwine,10.0,"You're not supposed to like this, very literally.  IMDb will block your reviews of this movie if you praise it.  Amazon (owned by the same company) is fudging the like ratio, and Youtube did the same with the trailer.

That makes sense.  It really does.

Maverick is a patriotic action movie with a male lead that doesn't make the male lead look like an idiot.  The white guy isn't evil.  America isn't evil.  It's a sequel that doesn't trash the heroes of the first film or attack the fans.

From start to finish it's just a solid apolitical action movie.

So of course you are supposed to hate it, it literally breaks all the rules of modern Hollywood.

And that was why it was the biggest blockbuster of the past few years.  That is why it had returns that would be a mega-bock buster pre-COVID.  It's the type of movie that people actually want to see, which is why it's under attack on certain sites.  You're not supposed to know that people like it and they weren't supposed to make a movie that people wanted to see.

Everything has to be a propaganda piece.  

But you want to know a secret?  If this came out in the 80s it wouldn't have done well.  It's not as good of an action movie as they had back then.  It actually sort of sucks compared to a lot of the classic action movies of this genre.

But then it came out in 2022 and the rules have all changed.  Today everything is racist or far left.  So what you have here is a movie that is great... by 2022 standards... simply because it's not the crap that Hollywood is shoving down your throats and demanding that you like.",2023-01-16T19:00:52.831Z,361743,2 stars,0.2866891026496887
SputnikGalaxyWatcher,-1.0,"For me this movie was a letdown. Having watched the original Top Gun when it first came out, this version comes nowhere close to that one. Like most movies in the past decade or so, real originality is lacking. Seems like all there are nowadays are rehashes of older stuff. The supporting cast is lackluster at best.

madriyanto,-1.0,"As a teenager, nearly 40 years ago, I was consumed by the original Top Gun. It fueled my dreams of becoming a pilot, and Tom Cruise's charisma, alongside the adrenaline-pumping aerial sequences, left an indelible mark on my youth. When I heard the familiar theme song for Top Gun, goosebumps erupted across my skin.

While I had sky-high expectations, I confess to feeling a tinge of disappointment. After all, it's been nearly two years since the premiere, and the hype had settled. Yet, I found myself glued to the couch, unable to tear my eyes away. Maverick did its job - it satisfied the old fanboys. The producers flawlessly recreated the vibe of the original, masterfully capturing the essence of that 80s era, but with cutting-edge technology and cinematography. The film is a testament to their meticulous attention to detail.

But Maverick isn't just about nostalgia. For me, it's a celebration of aviation technology. Seeing the F-18 Super Hornet and the iconic F-14 Tomcat, my childhood fighter jet heroes, soar across the screen alongside newer generation aircraft was a joy for my inner tech enthusiast.

While the technical aspects are captivating, the film transcends the niche. Top Gun: Maverick is a universal experience, packed with heart-stopping action, engaging characters, and a compelling story that resonates with anyone who's ever chased a dream. It may not be the groundbreaking masterpiece that the original was, but it's a thrilling and nostalgic journey that will leave you breathless.",2024-06-25T09:50:06.348Z,361743,4 stars,0.47471994161605835

I enjoyed this movie a lot. It has a straight and simple and yet captivating story and a lot of very good top tier action, and wich was done by using mostly practical effects and filmmaking and was not a CGI overkill, unlike so many blockbuster action movies nowadays.

The movie also stands out as an example for a very good sequel, which might even be superior to the first movie.

If you can see past the blatant and yet relatively sparingly inserted ""US world police"" prop***anda (which was in the first ""Top Gun"" as well), this movie can be a very fun ride for you, especially if you are into a somewhat conservative action movie experience. Thank you, Tom Cruise, for giving us such a movie in the 2020ies!

misubisu,5.0,"## **Top Gun: Maverick (2022) Review: A Technically Brilliant, Emotionally Hollow Shell - 5/10**

*Top Gun: Maverick* is a film of profound contradiction. It is a breathtaking technical achievement, a masterclass in practical aerial cinematography that viscerally puts you in the cockpit. Yet, beneath the roaring jets and flawless spectacle lies a narrative and emotional core so thin it evaporates upon contact with the air. It is the cinematic equivalent of a perfectly engineered, beautifully polished shell with nothing inside.

### The FIGJAM Problem

Tom Cruise's Maverick is the embodiment of **FIGJAM** (""F\*\*k I'm Good, Just Ask Me"") without the need for words. The character's entire arc, which the film presents as one of reluctant mentorship and confronting mortality, is undermined by the fact that he is, simply, always right. He is the only one who can fly the mission, the only one who can teach the new generation, and the only one with the mystical, untouchable ""feel"" for flying. This strips away any genuine vulnerability or growth. The movie tells us he's a relic; it shows us he's an infallible demigod. This creates a massive emotional disconnect, reducing the high-stakes mission to a foregone conclusion.

### A Hollow Framework for Effects

The original *Top Gun*, for all its 80s excess, had a raw, emotional through line. It was a story about ego, loss, and friendship, wrapped in a glossy package. *Maverick* jettisons this for a plot that is less a story and more a series of training montages leading to a climax with all the narrative complexity of a video game level. The characters, including the new generation of pilots, are given paper-thin motivations (Daddy issues, mostly) that serve only to reflect back on Maverick's legacy.

The overacting, particularly from Cruise, feels like a performance calibrated for a much broader, simpler film. In moments meant to convey deep emotional turmoil, we are given intense stares and clenched jaws that signify ""seriousness"" without ever revealing a complex inner life. It's a hollow framework, meticulously designed to support the only thing the film truly cares about: the spectacular, real-life aerial sequences.

### The Verdict

**5/10 - A Triumph of Spectacle Over Substance**

*Top Gun: Maverick* is not a horrible movie. Its technical prowess is undeniable and deserves recognition. As a pure sensory experience, it is undeniably effective. However, it is **certainly NOT a good movie** if you seek compelling characters, a meaningful story, or any emotional depth beyond manufactured nostalgia.

It is a brilliantly executed, $170 million military recruitment ad. A thrilling, empty-calorie ride that wows the eyes but leaves the heart and mind completely unchallenged and ultimately, unsatisfied.",2025-11-16T05:18:54.338Z,361743,2 stars,0.40559545159339905
Chris Sawin,9.0,"People will hate _Men_ if they go into it wanting a straightforward story or a film that has one, clear cut meaning once those end credits crawl across the screen. _Men_ doesn’t offer either of those things. The film features stunning cinematography, a mesmerizing forest sequence, and a thrilling score that is as unsettling as it is operatic. Rory Kinnear is exquisitely chilling. This is the type of horror film that is purely, disgustingly, and gloriously nasty and ambiguous. _Men_ is simultaneously a film you shouldn’t think too much about and yet absolutely think about all the time once it’s over.

CinemaSerf,6.0,"""Harper"" (Jessie Buckley) heads off to rural Gloucestershire in England to take a break after the apparent suicide of her husband ""James"" (Paapa Essiedu). On arrival at the manor house she has rented for a fortnight, she is welcomed by the typical country squire type in ""Geoffrey"" (Rory Kinnear). She goes for a walk, during which she notices that she is being followed - and the man following her is naked. Spooked, she returns to her home to find that this is just the start of some seriously bizarre goings on in this tiny hamlet. What flaws this all from the start for me is that we see everyone in this community - the policeman, vicar, schoolboy, pub landlord as variations of the same man - Kinnear, yet the ""Harper"" character does not seem to clock this; she certainly doesn't acknowledge it, and that just doesn't work for me. If I were in a village where everyone looked the same, I'd have been out of there in a shot. Anyway, she lingers on for a while as things become more perilous and she is clearly the focus of the malevolent intentions of this creature - and it all builds to quite a clever feat of special effects and not a great deal else. There is a largely undeveloped underlying plot line about her on-the-rocks marriage that may have had some bearing on the conclusion, but to be honest I was rather bored by the repetition of it all by then. The exterior photography is nice enough and Buckley is competent, but Kinnear's roles are all about the skills of the make up artists. The dialogue is nothing special leaving the score to work hard to try to create a sense of peril that, in the end, I felt was just ... lacking. It's no worse than many of the recent Blumhouse efforts, but that doesn't make it very good, either.",2022-06-04T10:32:21.367Z,780609,3 stars,0.5455150008201599
Manuel São Bento,5.0,"MORE SPOILER-FREE REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/

""Men is undoubtedly one of the most unique, macabre, weird, expectedly divisive films of the year.

Rob Hardy's cinematography is truly impressive, navigating viewers through eye-popping visual details with the help of mesmerizing makeup and VFX. The score by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow is also quite atmospheric and haunting.

Nevertheless, Alex Garland exhaustively repeats his obvious, heavy-handed message to the point of losing all emotional connection with the underdeveloped protagonist. The last act focuses too much on excessive, unpleasant gore to prove a point over and over again unnecessarily, functioning as a distracting, underwhelming conclusion.

Jessie Buckley - extraordinary - deserves much better, as does the versatile Rory Kinnear, who plays multiple roles.""

Nathan,4.0,"Men, directed by Alex Garland, is a movie that fails to live up to its potential despite having some redeeming qualities.

The cinematography is fantastic and haunting, with creative shots that add to the overall experience. But this quality dips towards the end, with the director focusing more on horror elements in the tune of slasher/home invasion instead of psychological. The sound design is excellent, and the sinister feel really adds to the movie's overall mood. The acting is good, but nothing too spectacular. No performances really blew me away. However, the body horror in the movie is fantastic, and it had the hair on the back of my neck standing up. Even though I do think it is not entirely needed, I have to give props in that department.

Unfortunately, the script is pretty dreadful. The message is very in your face, overly complex and did not work for me. It was quite a turn off too, as it seemed as though the director was trying to say all men were the same and were terrible human beings. I know it had deeper meaning than that, but that surface level message is undeniable. I mean honestly, every person she encounters is such a massive piece of shit, not one person would have held out a helping hand? 

Something that did really bother me was that the movie starts off as a creative psychological horror, but takes a spin in the third act that divulges into body horror mixed with slasher elements, which really takes away from the intriguing first 45 minutes of the film. Combine that with dreadful pacing, which will result in the audience feeling like they're waiting for the movie to be over. 

Overall, Men is a forgettable movie that had potential, but unfortunately, failed to deliver in many aspects.

griggs79,7.0,"Men, directed by Alex Garland, is a haunting exploration of grief, trauma, and the sinister dynamics of gender, wrapped in an atmospheric and unsettling narrative.

Rory Kinnear delivers a truly epic performance, embodying multiple characters with an eerie and disturbing versatility that is nothing short of remarkable. His ability to switch between personas, each more unsettling than the last, adds a layer of dread that permeates the entire film. Kinnear’s portrayal is both chilling and mesmerising, leaving a profound impact that elevates the film’s haunting themes and invites deep reflection.

Jessie Buckley is equally superb as Harper, a woman grappling with her past while confronting an escalating series of horrors. Her performance is deeply emotional, grounding the film with a raw, visceral intensity that makes her character’s journey compelling and harrowing. Buckley’s ability to convey a wide range of emotions, from vulnerability to defiance, makes her a perfect counterpart to Kinnear’s unsettling characters.

Men is the first film in a long time to move and terrify me equally. Garland masterfully balances psychological tension with moments of sheer terror, creating an unnerving experience that is as thought-provoking as it is captivating. The film’s blend of unsettling imagery, superb performances, and a deeply unsettling atmosphere make it a standout in contemporary horror, leaving a lasting impression that is difficult to shake.",2024-09-23T13:57:56.840Z,780609,4 stars,0.5921980738639832

Jordan_Gadger,2.0,"A rare squalor turned out, of course. The characters are like pictures of a bad artist, flat and empty. Facial expressions and forms are alien. There is no aesthetic admiration for this attempt at expression in 3d. No grace and beauty. There is no depth and love, an adequate plot. Inappropriate flat humor. A fierce mockery of the innermost. A ridiculous untalented division without a sense of beauty, reminiscent of the very pirated products from the movie. They piled everything up and made an unintelligible dump. A bunch of some defective characters, like that Sonic who talks about the existence of the original Sonic, by the way... They ridiculed the key points, just for fun, quite unreasonably, only comedy is completely out of place here, as are the creators-comedians. And all this, of course, under the sauce ""We love Rescuers"". Well, well... We couldn't do it, in general, for real. In a Disney way. Only that picture was remembered, which hung on the wall of the actor Roquefort. And how wonderful it would be if the whole movie was of this style and with an adequate plot.
Fortunately, this is not an original reality that could continue the canon. To understand this substitution, which tried to continue the series, it is enough to see in the film an episode with the participation of Akiva Shaffer, who allegedly filmed the original series in 1990, damn it.

bcorrel2,-1.0,"When Chip 'N Dale was first conceptualized, the writers needed to make a decision: would this movie be primarily made for those who had watched Rescue Rangers as children, or would it attempt to reboot the duo for a new generation? Sadly, it would seem the writers chose to do both. Chip 'N Dale is a movie packed to the gills with decades of animation jokes and easter eggs, yet ultimately it cements itself as a children's movies, utilizing the same cringeworthy cliches that every other children's movie utilizes. This is only further exasperated by KiKi Layne's terrible performance as Ellie, so much so that I believe the total removal of her character would vastly improve the film.

Filipe Manuel Neto,9.0,"**A very good comedy and generally palatable to almost everyone.**

I just finished watching this movie with a friend of mine, and we were both pleased with what we saw. The film is an excellent comedy that manages to reach two different audiences: today's youth and their parents, who were young twenty years ago, because it makes direct allusions to various cultural elements that were very familiar to them. Personally, I was still very young in 2002, I was about to enter adolescence, but I was also touched by some nostalgic aspects.

The script is reasonably simple, but it works well: it all starts with Stephanie, and the way she decides to become popular and accepted after being snubbed at school. Things go well, and she becomes the archetype of the perfect teenager: sexy, blonde, cheerleader, sexually expedite, with an enviable boyfriend and a promising future. The icing on the cake was going to be her election as High School Prom Queen, and a massive after-party, complete with loss of virginity. It didn't happen: in an elaborate dance choreography, and by the work of a rival, she falls and ends up hospitalized, in a coma, for twenty years. In 2022, at last, she wakes up to a horrible reality: her body has changed, life has passed, her boyfriend married her rival, she is not the same and has nothing of what she wanted. So, she decides to go back to the High School, finish what she started and be Prom Queen… but the School has abolished that!

The script seeks to include a series of cultural allusions to the 90s and 2000s, ranging from films and series (_Sex and the City_, _Deep Impact_, _Aly McBeal_, _Clueless_), songs and musical artists (Britney Spears, Madonna, Mandy Moore) and objects of fashion and mass culture (the Tamagotchi, for example). We, who saw ourselves as teenagers between 2000 and 2010, know these things well, they were our fads and fashions. The film also criticizes the way today's youth view social and environmental causes, virtual life and social networks. In fact, it is easy to lose sight of reality when we have Instagram and Facebook full of thousands of friends and followers, and the film criticizes the young people who spend most of their time on these networks and the “influencers” who earn a lot of money at the expense of them, in addition to making jokes about the insincere way in which many young people face environmental and ecological causes, which they follow out for fashion and not because they are really aware of their importance. The film is very inclusive, and there are several characters that are of diverse ethnicities or homosexuals, explicitly or implicitly. This is something that Hollywood have been insisting on a lot after the Me Too movement and the Oscar boycott by black actors a few years ago, and I understand, although I don't like to see films used for political and social activism.

The cast has a powerful Rebel Williams in the lead role. She is not a rookie actress and has already shown us what she can do in other comedies like _Hustle_ or in dance movies like _Pitch Perfect_, and I daresay she is one of the most promising faces of Australian comedy this year. time. The film also features excellent guest appearances by Justin Hartley, Sam Richardson, Zoe Chao, Mary Holland and Chris Parnell. They each did their work very hard, and Chao, Richardson and Holland deserve special praise. As for the younger cast, I would highlight the good performance of Angourie Rice and also Jade Bender. The film also has a cameo by Alicia Silverstone, who has made similar films in her past, as we all know.

Technically, the film appears to be very low-key, overall. The cinematography is regular, there are no major visual gimmicks and the camera opts for a conventional shooting style.

Chris Sawin,7.0,"_Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_ is dark, silly, and fan pleasing. The film is at is most bewitching when Sam Raimi can let his horror roots be showcased. It will satisfy horror and superhero film fans alike, but would have and could have been even better if Raimi was allowed to dive even further into the horror genre. Be sure to stay after the credits, as well. There are two after credits sequences with the final one being so absurdly on the nose for Sam Raimi that it may be the most entertaining part of the film.

Manuel São Bento,7.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/doctor-strange-multiverse-madness-spoiler-free-review

""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is undoubtedly one of the most unique installments in the MCU, thanks to Sam Raimi's distinctive visual style and his impressive ability to elude the Marvel formula by seriously venturing into the horror elements. Never has a film from the cinematic universe been so violent, bloody, and terrifying.

Benedict Cumberbatch and especially Elizabeth Olsen carry the complex story about the multiverse through Michael Waldron's flawed screenplay. The balance between the various storylines could be better, America Chavez is just one MacGuffin to reach another MacGuffin, and the journey through the multiple universes only compensates for the mind-blowing visual effects.

Some personal disappointment is associated with the cameos treatment and the lack of real-location filming. Overall, more was expected from what was supposed to be Phase Four's ""big movie"", but it's a solid entry into the top half of the franchise.""

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Whilst I really did quite enjoy this - and it was great to be in a busy cinema again - it's really more of a testament to the skills of the VFX guys rather than to any of the writers. The story is really pretty thin with the engaging and confident Benedict Cumberbatch joining forces with the charismatic and feisty young Xochitl Gomez' ""America"" - a young lady who has been appearing in his dreams. Turns out, she can cross from one universe to another - and soon both are being sought by the mighty Elizabeth Olsen's ""Wanda Maximoff"" (surely a ""Bond"" girl?) who wants control of time so she can get back to her lost family, yada yada... Benedict Wong features sparingly, but always adds a little value as the ""Sorcerer Supreme"" and there are a few cameos from Charlize Theron and Sir Patrick Stewart to help prop up what is, admittedly, a pretty meagre second half. I think this multiverse strand could provide Marvel with the gift that keeps on giving, but they have got to tighten the pace up - two hours for this was just too long; the plot doesn't sustain it and though the combat scenes are nothing to the length in the ""Avengers"" movies; there is still far too much slack here. It does look and sound great on a big screen, though, and I am now warming to the star in the role (and his intuitive flying cape). Fun, but flawed.",2022-05-29T14:22:26.864Z,453395,3 stars,0.6507053971290588
Peter McGinn,5.0,"Obviously this film came loaded with the usual great special effects and endless battle scenes that I guess are needed to draw and hold your average superhero movie fan. Not so much of the Marvel wit and humor that are more like to hold me, the anything but average fan, or rather,not a fan at all, though I do like science fiction.

For me, the 500 pound elephant in the room that cast a shadow over the entire movie was the villain. Now if you haven’t seen the film yet this may count as a spoiler, though it is revealed fairly early on. But the former heroine turned evil one is a woman taken over by the dark side. But what got me was her motive. Not to take over the world or the universe or the multiverse, but rather because she wanted to be a mommy to kids she lost along the way, or never had, or something. Billions of people in multiple universes died because she didn’t want to adopt. 

It seems like inserting herself into one universe might have been enough for you or me, but I suppose she wanted more options open if something went wrong with the first kids whose mother she killed (or is it her alternate self?) to get hold of. Dr. Strange even asked about it once, and she blithely explained that if her new old kids got terribly sick, she could find the cure for anything in other universes. She is the perfect mom, doing anything for her kids; well, except for providing moral leadership and showing them the path to be a good person who helps others and contributes to the world around them. Yeah, do as I say, kids, not as I do. 

Whoever created the evil dark book that took over her personality would have been disappointed that it was used merely to seed a new family.",2022-06-29T09:23:55.531Z,453395,3 stars,0.41918057203292847

Nathan,8.0,"Dr. Strange explores the multiverse even further than Spider-Man: No Way Home. It was extremely entertaining, and Sam Raimi brought a good amount of horror to the MCU, even though I would have preferred slightly more. Both Dr. Strange and Scarlet Witch stole the show and really made this movie for me. Many movies you wish it were a bit shorter, but with Multiverse of Madness, I really wish we got 15 more minutes. A lot happens in a short 2-hour chunk, and pacing would have been much better if it were given a slightly longer run time.

Somehow they managed to take a perfectly acceptable character and transform it into crazy madness and barbaric nonsense. Even those initial stumbling blocks I could have gotten past, but Disney decided to interject their woke garbage into this movie like many other new shows which has now put them on a blacklist for so many others like me. Not sure I would ever pay or even 'watch for free' anything by this company again, but that is me. I have standards, and clearly Disney is determined to brainwash their viewers with woke trash.

A Marvel movie so different than the rest... while still just like the rest. With the introduction of the Multiverse, this movie took full advantage of the opportunity to explore new worlds, new variations on familiar characters, and character cameos that Marvel fans have been desperately waiting for! I enjoyed Raimi's horror influences on the MCU. Unfortunately, the movie propelled itself from start to finish at breakneck speed, preventing the story from really taking advantage of the exciting cameos and roster of characters. The pace also jumped past true character motivations making the average audience confused and unsympathetic towards a formerly well-accepted hero now turned villain.",2022-08-20T00:23:43.314Z,453395,3 stars,0.5786394476890564

Wish it had a bit more finesse in it he way it handles its themes and structure, but I had a lot of fun. I’m a big fan of Sam Rami’s past work and the stylistic flourishes (seemingly) brought on by his involvement were definitely welcome given how homogeneous the other MCU films have become. Might be the best cinematography and editing in the franchise! Also shoutout to Xochitl Gomez for holding her own here, second feature length project and its on this scale? Good stuff.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,9.0,"I really like Doctor Strange and i really liked the first Doctor Strange movie. So of course I was worried that Marvel being Marvel would screw this one up with their usual woke nonsense or just a substandard Hollywood writer hack script as they too often have done.

Fortunately that was not the case. I quite liked this one.

The movie is a CGI special effects feast of course. That is really one of the main reasons to watch this movie. However, Benedict Cumberbatch is really great as Doctor Strange as well.

The movie has a half decent story. As good as you could expect from a Marvel movie. As usual it is a mix of action, suspense and comedy relief and Marvel has actually managed to get a decent balance in this movie. Doctor Strange stays competent throughout the movie and although Wong is sometimes a bit silly it is not too bad. There is little of the unintelligent slapstick “comedy” that Marvel sometimes pollute their movies with.

I have to say that the main bad guy, Wanda the Scarlet Witch, was a bit mediocre though. Sure, when she let loose with her magic it was generally cool but, to me, she lacked real bad guy charisma.

At times the movie became a rather violent actually. Although there was no real gore in it, the way Wanda disposed of some of the heroes in the alternate universe was somewhat brutal. Also the alternate universe undead Doctor Strange was almost horror movie material.

The bottom line, for me, is that overall this was a very good movie.",2022-11-03T08:14:19.888Z,453395,4 stars,0.8097236156463623

Filipe Manuel Neto,7.0,"**A colossal work of incredible CGI, in which the script is quite lost, and the actors do a good job playing characters they already know well.**

Contrary to my custom, I saw this film directly after the first one. It wasn't my will, it was the TV channel that decided to show them in sequence. And that's good: things are clearer and more understandable if we have previously seen the initial film, which explains the origin of the character and her journey. There are some aspects and details of the script that I didn't understand, but as Marvel tends to chain its films together, as if they were the threads of a tapestry, I believe that what I didn't understand will be related to the number of Marvel films that I still didn't have the opportunity to see it.

The film is directed by Sam Raimi, which immediately raised my eyebrows: after all, he is a truly creative and intelligent director, who has already given us works worthy of praise, although hero films have not gone well for the director in the past. As far as I know, production was extremely confusing and, as we know, heavily affected by the recent pandemic. Raimi took advantage, rewrote a good part of the script and revised everything, in order to create a bizarre, somewhat scary story (he started out as a director of cheap horror films, let's remember), about the multiverse, a concept that has been explored a lot in the cinema of this decade.

As expected, the film was a brutal success, both at the box office and in terms of specialized critics, having registered the fourth-best box office of 2022, and was sacramentally ignored by the Oscars, even in the visual and technical categories where, in my opinion, opinion, he could have had a good chance of winning a prize. In fact, the film is a visual spectacle of supreme proportions, making the most of the multiverse's enormity of possibilities for a visual experience that is worth it in itself. If the first film had already been colossal in terms of effects and CGI, this film surpasses it almost in every way. The sets, costumes, props, makeup, everything was thought out in minute detail and makes good use of the huge budget that Marvel made available. And the work of the stuntmen and choreographers was excellent in the action and fight scenes.

The script brings together two characters from the Marvel universe in the same story: the already known Dr. Strange and the Scarlet Witch, Wanda Maximoff. Before this film, and what came before it, I didn't know them because I'm not a big fan of comics, although I recognize Marvel's exceptional work in this field over several decades. There is also a third character who enters here, America Chavez, a young Latina who, honestly, must be some kind of third-line character, but who assumes considerable relevance to the plot. In general, the script seems weaker to me than that of the first film, and this could be a direct consequence of the immense confusion that was the entire process of conceiving and producing the film, between a pandemic, withdrawals and all sorts of setbacks.

Benedict Cumberbatch returns to his character and does a job well done, although the actor seems to be working with slightly less interesting material and entering a comfort zone that makes things more monotonous. Elizabeth Olsen was also perfectly at ease with her character, as she had already played it in other films in the Marvel universe that I, as far as I remember, have not yet seen. She is quite good at what she does, and the actress's work is convincing. There are also several other actors from the first film who return for a new job: Rachel McAdams and Chiwetel Ejiofor have an easier job, but it seems to me that the film doesn't particularly take advantage of them. Much better luck had Benedict Wong, with impeccable work, and Xochitl Gomez, who made positive use of the opportunity, even without deserving the spotlight.",2024-05-14T10:17:21.214Z,453395,4 stars,0.46073365211486816
tmdb51616167,5.0,"The introduction of Doctor Strange in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is hailed as a great beginning, with the character's origin story setting the stage for his journey into the mystical world. The inclusion of Christine Palmer, portrayed by Rachel McAdams, is praised as a solid choice, although some viewers feel that her character could have been further developed, with a more profound exploration of her role and potential in the MCU.

While the first Doctor Strange film lays a strong foundation for the character and the magical realm he inhabits, some fans express disappointment with the portrayal of the ultimate villain. Despite this, the film is recognized as a promising start to the Doctor Strange storyline within the MCU, introducing audiences to a new dimension of superheroes and storytelling.

However, the sequel, ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,"" receives criticism for its perceived shortcomings. Some viewers feel that the film falls short of expectations, lacking the depth and coherence expected from a Marvel installment. The rushed nature of the film and its perceived lack of attention to detail lead to disappointment, with viewers feeling let down by the outcome.

The underwhelming reception of the sequel raises concerns about the future of the Doctor Strange franchise, with doubts lingering about the direction and quality of upcoming installments.

Chris Sawin,3.0,"_Memory_ juggles so many subplots to unsatisfactory results. It’s as if the story throws a ball in the air for every concept in the film (Alzheimer’s, human trafficking, the FBI vs the police, rich people getting whatever they want, etc) only to allow each ball to smack against the ground without trying to catch them after their initial toss. For a film about a guy who kills people with the authorities chasing him for nearly two hours, _Memory_ is a monotonous bore. Not even Liam Neeson lighting himself on fire to cauterize a bullet wound can save what is otherwise a forgetful and fatigued memoir of a hoary hit man.

I'm a big Liam Neeson fan. He trained Batman and Obi-Wan, led the A-Team and the Men in Black, and had the most intimidating and awesome phone call in cinematic history. Non-Stop, The Commuter, and The Grey were all solid films, too, but let's face it… he isn't getting any younger, so his action movies are slowing in pace. Memory was smart enough to incorporate that into the script while still having Neeson kick some butt. This movie is an improvement over some of his recent stuff like the Marksman (and, from what I hear, Blacklight), but I sure do miss the days of Taken or Kingdom of Heaven. My hopes were higher with Martin Campbell directing, but I spent most of the movie looking at my phone. It's not terrible, but it needed to be a little darker and more menacing to hold my attention.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"This latest offering from Julian Fellowes presents two stories centred around the landed ""Grantham"" family. The first sees the dashing ""Barker"" (Hugh Dancy) come to Downton to make a film - that will pay for a much needed new roof - and soon makes friends with the absentee-husbanded ""Lady Mary"" (Michelle Dockery). Sadly, though, he soon discovers that silent movies are rapidly losing their charm - and the stars, especially an entertaining ""Myrna"" (Laura Haddock) are facing a challenge that ended the careers of many a silent movie star - a voice that could strip paint. Meantime the grown ups head to the south of France to investigate a beautiful villa that has been bequeathed to the elderly Dowager Countess, and where they must tread a fine line between a generous welcome and open hostility from the erstwhile owners of this lavish property. We flit between the two threads effortlessly, with plenty of grand cinematography at both Highclere Castle and on the Côte D'Azur. The script is frequently quite amusing - with most of the best lines from those ""downstairs""; there is a soupçon of romance, the odd bit of melodrama and loads for fans of these characters to enjoy. I found the Deborah Mitford-esque ending quite poignant too, with the Dames Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton alongside a film-stealing scene from the underused Kevin Doyle (""Moseley"") adding weight and pith to the story. I still struggle with Elizabeth McGovern, Hugh Bonneville is most certainly not at his best here, and the French story seems contrived at times, but essentially this is just another stylish template for some well established acting talent to deliver well established roles in a characterful and engaging fashion.

I would have created a more femel-inclusive film with a femel director (or, at least, a femel director for the film within in the femel); femel composers; and an all-femel big band.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"No-one could ever accuse Nicolas Cage of not having a sense of humour. He plays himself for most of this, depicting a somewhat fallen star whose agent (Neil Patrick Harris) finds him a gig for $1m to go to the birthday party of his wealthy Mallorcan superman ""Javi"" (Pedro Pascal). Lack of options force him to travel and he quite quickly befriends his adulatory, spring screenplay writer, amigo. Snag - well Tiffany Haddish (""Vivan"") is the CIA on the island, and she tries to co-opt him onto a cunning plan to trap ""Javi"" - whom she believes to be a criminal kingpin behind the kidnap of the daughter of a politician. What now ensue are some quite fun escapades as the actor has to turn his hand to skills he would do off pat if he were in front of a camera, but not so readily in ""real life"" - and it turns out that he isn't half bad, either. Is ""Javi"" really the baddie? Will Cage rise to the challenge? All is revealed in this amiable parody of not just many of his own films, but of espionage and action drama in general. It's got some car chases, fancy locations, power boats and a room with a waxwork that would not have looked out of place with Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. A bit ripe at times, the dialogue is peppered with plenty of wittiness and Cage plays the exasperated, then terrified, then motivated actor with aplomb and with his tongue in his cheek. Pascal makes for a fun foil keeping the bromance bubbling along nicely, and with Sharon Horgan delivering well as his long-suffering ex-wife (""Olivia"") this is a well paced and enjoyable adventure romp.",2022-04-26T07:53:35.180Z,648579,4 stars,0.545133650302887

The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is a hilarious meta ride filled with goofy charm and outrageous comedy. Nic Cage made this movie possible and wonderful - both because the movie is a parody of his career and because he was willing to be a good sport and play an exaggerated crazier version of himself. The story bears some similarities to Hot Fuzz as characters unknowingly discuss upcoming plot points that come later in the film. The whole thing is bonkers, entertaining, good-hearted, and silly. Pedro Pascal expands his acting range by playing an obsessed Nic Cage fan that boosts the comedy further by matching Cage's manic craze with sincere adoration and enthusiasm.

Nathan,-1.0,"The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is the Nicholas Cage show that I wanted but didn't fully know I needed.

This movie is fun, zany, witty, and just pure entertainment. I had a smile on my face for the entire movie. It doesn't take itself or the persona of Nicholas Cage very seriously. Often times poking fun at the career of Cage and the multitude of movies he has been, while simultaneously painting him as an absent and poor father. This is no easy task for an actor to face, but he does it excellently and really embraces his faults.

The plot is no cinematic masterpiece but it doesn't have to be. The best points in the is movie is the chemistry between Nick Cage and Pedro Pascal. They were beautifully synergized on screen and carried this movie to conclusion. It was so much fun seeing them develop a bromance that often times I found myself forgetting he was even suppose to be a villain.

It is not often you find a movie that is so self aware of what it is trying to be, but this movie tackles that so effectively creating a fun experience that any audience can enjoy.

r96sk,7.0,"Good stuff!

<em>'The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent'</em> is what I expected it to be. A breezy, comedic and extremely meta story with Nicolas Cage - sorry, I meant: Nick ... f*cking ... Whoa! Cage! Talking of whom, it's amusing seeing two Cages, especially the de-aged one!

Cage is great throughout. Away from him, Pedro Pascal is good value too. Overall, it's not a film to be taken serious - the opposite, in fact - but I had a positive time watching it. The calls to Cage's prior work, e.g. <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/con-air/"">Con Air</a>'</em>, is fun.",2023-02-19T03:32:20.633Z,648579,4 stars,0.6756054759025574

Spencer,5.0,"Let me start off by saying that I completely understand all of the hate this film is getting, and that's because for the first half of the film I hated it too. For too much of this film, a lot of the characters are just unlikable slobs . . . especially Mel Gibson's character of Bill Long. Also, the story plays out . . . well, it plays out terribly for the first half of the film. It wasn't until later in the film when Stuart Long decides to become a preacher that I was actually invested, and why's that? That's because Long was an absolute piece of trash that I didn't want to watch for the first half of the film. This does not go without saying that by the end I liked Stuart Long's character in the film, but I couldn't like him for the first half.

The film isn't precisely terrible, but it isn't good. The third act is solid, but everything in the first act is bad, and the second where Stu is transitioning is mediocre. This does not make for a good film. When the film is simply bad for the first two acts, it can't just make up for it with a good third act, which sucks because the third act was actually not too bad.

The entire path of redemption message is interesting, but we've seen it done before, and with much better characters to say the least, but of course, this isn't saying that the path to redemption is bad to watch, but it is still bland and has been done multiple times before.

It was nice to see Bill Long become a semi-decent human being at the end of the film, because he realizes he has to now actually care for his son, Stu, but it doesn't really redeem him as a character within the film's boundaries. Also, Bill's character is an absolute D-bag throughout most of the film, so it makes it extremely hard to like him as a character by the end of the film . . . but, boy, if seeing that final dance with his wife wasn't something. . . .

Forgiveness is really what's at the core of ""Father Stu"", but I've already covered that previously. What I'm trying to talk about here is how almost all the characters have something they want to be forgiven for. Bill & Kathleen Long do seem to regret their choices that brought them to this point in their lives, and it's clear that they regret whatever tore them apart. As for Stu, he wants to be forgiven for everything. He regrets just about everything he's done in his life up to this point. The sad part about it is: There's just too much that Stu's done for the audience to really forgive him completely, although it is terrible what happened to him.

In my eyes, ""Father Stu"" isn't absolutely terrible, and I do think that it's mediocre at best by the end of the day. The third act is very well done, but because of all the other stuff beforehand it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I think people should check this one out if they're interested, but other than that, just leave it be. Ultimately, ""Father Stu"" is a hard thumbs down for me.",2022-05-15T03:54:38.127Z,809140,2 stars,0.6661301851272583
CinemaSerf,6.0,"Mark Wahlberg is competent here as the eponymous boxer who takes a shine to the young church-going Carmen (Teresa Ruiz). He can't get near her, so he somewhat opportunistically decides to join her church and see if that helps. Thing is, pretty quickly he discovers that there is something to this ""God"" thing, and decides to try and get himself ordained for the priesthood - leaving all thoughts of the girl behind. Meantime, he discovers that he is suffering from a degenerative disease that will prove debilitating as he ages. It's one of those inspirational stories this, but I just didn't particularly like or empathise with ""Stu"". I found his profound and fairly sudden Damascine conversion hardly explained in the context of the film and except for a few decent contributions from the always reliable Jacki Weaver (his mother) the rest of this was all a bit lacking in substance. I never felt like I knew what made this man tick! It is nice to see Malcom McDowell back on the screen, and Mel Gibson is perfectly adequate as his rather indifferent father - but sadly, this whole film is a just another, sometimes touching, biopic of one man of many who live to inspire through their church (or not) whilst facing adversities and trials that trouble many people.

""All the Old Knives holds an extraordinary cast and an interesting premise, but Janus Metz's uninspired execution turns a movie with immense potential into yet another generic work with little replay value.

Chris Pine and Thandiwe Newton shine as the protagonists, and their astonishing chemistry transforms a simple dinner into the most captivating storyline of the entire narrative. However, the constant shifts between different timelines and distinct perspectives withdraw energy, pacing, and focus from Olen Steinhauer's decent screenplay.

Furthermore, Laurence Fishburne and Jonathan Pryce are criminally underused. It's far from being a non-recommended flick, but it leaves a somewhat bitter feeling by the end.""

CinemaSerf,5.0,"The scene is set in a fine restaurant where ""Pelham"" (Chris Pine) and ex-girlfriend ""Celia"" (Thandiwe Newton) and sharing some wine and considering who betrayed them many years earlier when their CIA operation around the hijacking of an airliner in Vienna went wrong. Ostensibly, ""Pelham"" is leading an investigation into the identity of the mole - it could be either of them, for all we know, or it could be their boss ""Compton"" (Sir Jonathan Pryce)... Sadly, though, John Le Carré this isn't. The narrative uses Pine's character as the conduit to interrogate all the potential suspects, and sadly that drags us into the solidly melodramatic aspects of his relationship with ""Celia"". On the plus side, that allows him to do what he has been trying to do ever since ""Star Trek"" (2009) - get his ass out on screen, but otherwise it is a terribly slowly paced affair. The espionage elements are largely subsumed into the relationship drama and frankly, neither Pine nor Newton have much to do in this dialogue heavy drudge of a film. It looks good, the production has a style to it; but quite simply not enough happens to keep it stimulating, the soporific lighting starts to take effects and after about 45 minutes I was really quite bored with it all.

CinemaSerf,7.0,"First things first - there is virtually nothing original with the plot here. A young prince ""Amleth"" (Oscar Novak who later morphs into an effective Alexander Skarsgård) witnesses the murder of his father ""King Aurvandil"" (Ethan Hawke) and the capture of his mother ""Gudrún"" (Nicole Kidman) by his treacherous uncle ""Fjölnir"" (Claes Bang). Lucky to escape with his life, he escapes to the land of the Rus where he is soon a capable and powerful warrior. When he learns that the traitor was, himself, deposed and now lives in the inhospitable Iceland, he decides to impersonate one of a group of slaves being sent to his farm so as to wreak his revenge. There are a few twists to the otherwise largely predictable plot - he meets the enigmatic ""Olga"" (Anya Taylor-Joy) and comes into possession of a deadly sword that can only be drawn at night; but what really makes this stand out is the gritty, dark and enthralling production. The headlines actors actually feature pretty sparingly, though we get a little more Kidman towards the end, and that's no bad thing. It leaves us to enjoy a storyline that draws heavily on the compelling Norse mythology. Not just of Odin, Freya, Valhallah and the like, but of the whole cult of nature; of animalistic behaviour amongst man and beast alike. It draws on a symbiotic relationship with the environment that tests the faith of pagan and Christian alike. It is brutal, but somehow not gratuitous. That's how man treated man; women were little better than breeding chattels and children were even further down the food chain. Robert Eggers has put much more meat on the bones than almost any similar depiction from this hugely rich and enthralling vein of mythology that mixes fact, fiction, fantasy, mysticism and fear very well. It's 2¼ of well paced adventure that looks stunning on a big screen and is well worth a watch there before it loses much of it's grand scale potency on a telly.",2022-04-18T10:21:25.684Z,639933,3 stars,0.49588581919670105
r96sk,9.0,"It took me a little while to get into it, but by its conclusion <em>'The Northman'</em> had fully entertained me. Great film!

First and foremost, I'm delighted that I did indeed enjoy this film as my only previous experience of director Robert Eggers was the - in my opinion, and apparently my opinion only! - severely unsatisfying <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/the-lighthouse-2019/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Lighthouse</a>'</em>. It's unmistakable that this 2022 flick is made by the same person, but happily the outcome is far greater.

The cast are top notch. Alexander Skarsgård and Anya Taylor-Joy are the two standouts, the latter of which is doing big things lately; she is excellent in the most recent season of television show <em>'Peaky Blinders'</em>, fwiw. Claes Bang, Ethan Hawke and Nicole Kidman are all very good. Willem Dafoe too, naturally.

The story is super absorbing, even early on when I was a tad unsure I was still very invested in what was happening onscreen. The dialogue is a big reason for that, as is the thumping score. At times it can feel like it might become too talky and full of itself in regards to its own mythology and all that, though thankfully it never strays into those realms. It also delivers plenty of action, alongside some good ol' violence as well - the ending is quality in that regard, among other reasons too.

First of all Vikings in this movie were represented more like an animals, acting like a rabid animals rather than humans and Vikings we have seen in popular TV shows, but the reason why I'm giving such a low score to this movie is simple - boredom. 

Character development was poor. I didn't care for any of them. Story was a typical vengeance story, nothing special or unique and the movie itself was very slow, lacking action and I almost fell a sleep. At first it seemed a realistic movie, but then they started putting supernatural things, so it wasn't realistic, but wasn't a typical unrealistic movie (like Marvel and DC) either.

And probably it’s the closest film about the Vikings era and culture. Is it perfect? Almost. But we will tell you more in our analysis. - **The Story** - In the North Atlantic of the 895 a.d., a story of betrayals and revenge happened. The protagonist is a little prince, Amleth, who will live his existence in the shadow of vengeance. His life's goal is to fulfil his desire to take back what someone else stole from him: a father, a mother and a kingdom. But, unfortunately, pain and revenge can transform a boy into a brutal wolve. Therefore, Amleth begins his journey, guided by Odin, because justice is what moves our God's desires. But what happened to Amleth? Where is this journey lead him?

The acting in this film was amazing all around. I really enjoyed Nicole Kidman and Alexander Skarsgård performances.

The action in this movie is few and far between, but when it does peak its head out it in brutal and visceral leaving audiences gasping at the bloody details and gore.

Ahmetaslan27,7.0,"It is a movie based on a Scandinavian legend called Amleth, and it was a major source of inspiration for Shakespeare the day he wrote the story of Hamlet. The movie tells the story of a young Viking prince who seeks revenge for his father's murder.

Northman's movie is one of the most beautiful and best movies I've seen in 2022. This movie is amazing in the full sense of the word, despite the negative opinions about the movie.

The atmosphere of the film and the way the story was presented was interesting. I enjoyed the stages of revenge that Prince Amleth did. I immersed myself in the world of The Northman from the first 10 minutes and forgot myself due to my vision of a brutal, miserable, cruel, barbaric and cold world, in addition to a strange mixture between realism, fantasy and hallucinations.

The nice stuff about the movie is the mention of Norse mythology from Northsimology. If you want these characters, they are in the game The Lord of War.

Director Robert Eggers, when he directs any movie, you find his touch and personality in the films he directs, such as The Witch 2015 and The Night House 2019. Robert paid great attention to details, and he wrote the characters beautifully and the dialogues that he writes in his films in a literary form, forming a rich dialogue, but at the same time You find it interesting.


The combat scenes were wonderful and were directed beautifully. I have seen many long scenes, scenes that you see as very violent and bloody, and these scenes are difficult for the director to produce in a manner that calls for perfection, given that they require replaying dozens of times. The director knew how to attract the viewers' attention to the furthest limits.

The acting of Alexander Skarsgård was excellent. I felt his psychological suffering, in addition to Anna Taylor. She is ingenious and is good at playing any role. If you ask her, if you give her to act as a standing tree, she will do it very well.",2023-03-25T11:01:14.427Z,639933,4 stars,0.5686683058738708

""Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is a significant improvement over its predecessors, proving that Steve Kloves really can work miracles - J. K. Rowling still has a lot to learn.

By completely shifting the main focus of the franchise to the love relationship between Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald, as well as the exploration of the former's imperfections and the tragic, complex past of his family, it gains an emotionally powerful, genuinely fascinating narrative component. Jude Law and Mads Mikkelsen's superb performances broadly contribute to this.

Too bad the first half suffers from the constant tweaks to the saga, taking once-important characters through irrelevant side adventures and repairing plot points established in earlier installments, seriously undermining the previous films and negatively affecting the pacing of this one.

I also feel the same about the cast as I do for the preceding instalments, with the likes of Eddie Redmayne and Jude Law not doing much for me; though Law is at his best in the role here. I will say, however, that I did mildly enjoy Jessica Williams' performance.

The pacing is a tad iffy, if nothing super slow. The ending does feel delayed, I would've personally cut a decent chunk of it to be honest. The dialogue and humour is average, but one scene involving Pickett and Teddy did make me laugh in fairness.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,2.0,"I have to confess that I went into watching this movie with quite some negative bias following woke Disney’s dismissal of Johnny Depp. Not that I am such a great fan of Depp but it was just wrong. Woke Disney’s asshats have been trying to get rid of him since the first Pirates movie so they used a bullshit excuse to get rid of him.

Then already in the first couple of scenes woke Disney goes full woke to cater for a very small but loudmouthed minority. Totally unnecessary since the vast majority do not care and a lot of said majority are simply fed up by having woke shit crammed into the movies for no justifiable reason whatsoever.

So, for me, this movie did get off to a poor start indeed.

Unfortunately the rest of the movie had literally nothing in it to remedy this bad start except for a bunch of special effects. I really do not understand what woke Disney thought when the put this franchise killer together.

The first movie, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, in the franchise was a great movie. It was colorful, it was family oriented and it was filled with magic and fantastic beasts. It was fun, it was humorous and it had a bit of adventure in it.

This movie is nothing like that. Why they call it Fantastic Beasts I do not understand. They should call it Boring Political Drama in the Potter Universe instead.

It is dark, grey and, mostly, boring. It is not really a family movie. A lot of the time not much is happening except people walking, standing or sitting and looking gloomy. There are some outbursts of magic action and these are really the only enjoyable scenes in the movie thanks to the special effects.

They even managed to drag the supposedly happy ending epilogue out to become frustratingly boring. Amazing how Disney, who has made so many enjoyable family movies, has transformed into woke Disney spewing out one disaster after another.",2022-08-16T09:56:41.816Z,338953,2 stars,0.5758084058761597

CinemaSerf,7.0,"Why, oh why, did they have to clutter this up with a romance? As a wartime adventure film, it's got all the ingredients for a cracker. As WWII starts to turn into a more offensive affair, the allies are looking for any means to divert the Nazis from their true intentions. To that end, ""Montague"" (Colin Firth) and ""Colmondeley"" (Matthew Macfadyen) concoct a cunning plan to plant fake documents on a corpse, wash it ashore in Spain and then let corruption and a nefarious network of spies do their worst! It's a remake of the exciting ""Man Who Never Was"" (1956) and to be fair, is quite a good one. Director John Madden manages to immerse us in the intricate, sometimes quite amusing, planning of this wacky scheme. Simon Russell Beale is entertainingly convincing as the stoic, borderline desperate, Churchill as is Jason Isaacs as the sceptical ""Admiral Godfrey"". Dame Penelope Wilton reminded me a bit of ""Miss Baring"" from (""I Was Monty's Double"") from 1957 and the story gather pace nicely. Sadly, though, once their plan is activated the second, more dangerous, part of the plot is seriously rushed and undercooked. The enemy's attempts to verify what we think they have read is nowhere near developed well enough, and that's why the romance - between Firth and their clever and resourceful assistant ""Jean"" (Kelly MacDonald) drags it down. Sure, it's offers an humanity element depicting the impact of war on people. His (part Jewish) family have relocated to the USA for their safety and she is a war widow; but that storyline leads to intra-character conflict that shows up Macfadyen as not a particularly good actor. Still, I found the two hours flew by. The production looks great with only a sparing use of CGI, a fine score from Thomas Newman and it's underpinned by a good story.

r96sk,7.0,"It's nothing that I overly enjoyed, though <em>'Operation Mincemeat'</em> is a good flick.

A suitably entertaining (true, if likely 'reimagined' and all that) tale is told within roughly 128 minutes, I do think that run time could've been shorter but I wouldn't go as far as to say it drags or anything - I just felt a few moments at the end where it could've been wrapped up quicker, that's all.

Most things in this film are what you'd pretty much expect from a British production of this sort, including the cast which is full of many recognisable faces from across UK television and film. Colin Firth and Matthew Macfadyen are a pleasant pairing in the lead roles, while Kelly Macdonald leads the rest of the solid onscreen talent nicely. I also note the appearances of Johnny Flynn and Simon Russell Beale, who were both also in 2022's <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/the-outfit-2022/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Outfit</a>'</em> - a quality film, fwiw.

When the dastardly ""Robotnik"" manages to escape from his prison in a galaxy far, far, way and returns with the echidna from hell (""Knuckles"") though, our blue pal finds himself and his family in considerable peril. Luckily, help is on hand from the twin-tailed ""Tails"" and battle lines are drawn Who can find the giant emerald first? The story is pretty derivative - bits of ""Indiana Jones""; ""National Treasure"" and even ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" all seem to have influenced the story, which I have to say is a little predictably thin. That said, it is well placed with plenty in the script for the grown ups amongst the audience. ""Sonic"" makes for quite a likeable rodent and Jim Carrey""s engagingly hammy, moustachioed, megalomanic works well. The star? Well that's Natasha Rothwell's no-nonsense, would-be bride ""Rachel"" (a part of the storyline that doesn't work so well, but she is definitely not to be messed with). The visual effects are impressive and though maybe fifteen minutes too long, I still found it very much better than I had expected.",2022-04-04T09:35:30.915Z,675353,4 stars,0.8550965785980225
Manuel São Bento,7.0,"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-spoiler-free-review

""Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a vastly superior sequel to the first adaptation.

Jeff Fowler works with his screenwriting team to fix some of the issues with the original flick, successfully managing to create a much less corporate work, more focused on Sonic and, this time, also Tails and Knuckles, in addition to putting humans aside in a subplot that, even so, still bothered more than it should.

Taking advantage of phenomenal voice acting from the cast, as well as an already iconic performance by Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, entertainment levels soar tremendously as the action-adventure sequences amaze viewers with praiseworthy animation and visual effects, as well as an engaging main narrative that expands on the origin of the hedgehogs while simultaneously developing the same characters.

Fun for kids and adults alike.""

Sonic the Hedgehog 2 picks up not long after the events of the first film. Doctor Robotnik (Jim Carrey) was banished from Earth by Sonic (Ben Schwartz) and crash-landed his spaceship on the Mushroom Planet. His only means of escape is Sonic’s quill, which is flowing with immense energy, and he uses it to send out a distress signal. This catches the attention of Knuckles (Idris Elba), another super-powerful anthropomorphic animal like Sonic. Knuckles is the last living member of the echidna tribe that was wiped out in the same war that sent Sonic to Earth many years ago.",2022-06-20T18:18:56.278Z,675353,3 stars,0.4577479362487793
Per Gunnar Jonsson,8.0,"The third time is the charm or, after having been less than thrilled about the last two movies I have watched this one was finally one that I quite enjoyed.

When I watched the first Sonic movie with the kids I was quite amused by it. This one I also watched with the kids and I have to say it was some fun two hours.

These movies are pure comedies with an aspect of adventure. Make no mistake about, they are silly movies. Then, with Jim Carrey in one of the lead roles that is what anyone that has not lived under a rock in Coyote land would expect.

Jim Carrey more often than not grates on me with his overacting and ridiculous behavior but in this movie he is the perfect fit.

The movie sets the tone right away when it starts at the mushroom planet, or as Jim Carrey (Dr Robotnik) calls it, the piece of shitake planet, with Dr Robotnik’s coffee making machinery.

What follows is one long ride of, mostly, slapstick jokes but still following the red thread of the story. A story which is not really bad and which adds a nice adventure aspect to the movie.

The movie even adds some realism, although they probably did not realize that during production, in that the federal agents are just as big a–holes as they have proven themselves to be in real life lately.

The grand finale with Dr Robotnik’s huge robot was quite hilarious. I really do not want to spoil things but watch out for that moustache. I’m happy that they refrained from following up that snot laser with a fart laser though.

Bottom line, a really fun family adventure movie.",2022-08-14T13:42:32.367Z,675353,4 stars,0.656354546546936

Sonic 2 continues the formula that brought its predecessor success the first time with colorful, funny characters that make jokes that every kid will giggle at and a completely unrestrained Jim Carrey in his element and at his best. This time the movie swaps Sonic's human sidekicks for animated characters from the games, with Idris Elba's Knuckles being surprisingly funny (I didn't expect that from the trailers). Just like the first movie, Carrey makes this movie so entertaining. His outrageous performance perfectly fits the role of a kids' video game villain, and his snappy dialogue and quipped one-liners made me laugh at almost every scene he graced. Sonic 2 is not a typical movie I would choose for myself, but I'm not upset when my little daughter chooses to watch it over many other kids' movie options.",2023-01-02T02:29:03.549Z,675353,4 stars,0.4737344980239868

""Morbius is yet another disaster from the Sony-Marvel shared universe.

Despite good performances from Jared Leto and Matt Smith and even a couple of visually captivating action sequences, the formulaic screenplay that seems to originate from the beginning of the century ruins everything in its path.

From the predictability and zero creativity of the main plot to the heavy reliance on uninteresting, unnecessary exposition, Daniel Espinosa finds his most significant problem in the blatant lack of care in the treatment of the characters.

The narrative logical lapses are too many to ignore and even amplified by extremely messy editing, a third act wrapped in an unfathomable blend of CGI, and a plagiarized score.

One of the most embarrassing productions by a major studio in recent years.""

CinemaSerf,6.0,"I can't go lower than 3 stars because ever since ""Alexander"" (2004) I've had a tiny crush on Jared Leto, and some of the trails for this made him look swarthy and hot too. To be fair, also, he is not afraid of spending a great deal of time in the make up chair, as we saw in ""House of Gucci"" (2021) and frequently see here. Sadly, though, after my appreciation of Jared's eye candiness wore off, what I was left with was Luke Evans' ""Dracula Untold"" (2014) just without Charles Dance, and a hint of ""Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (from 1931). The imagery is fine, the film looks super - but so what. Marvel/Columbia should be doing that anyway. It's the story. It's so thin. Matt Smith is lightweight at the best of times, and together with Adria Arjona's really unremarkable contribution as Leto's sidekick ""Dr.Bancroft"" and some sparing interventions from the other Jared in this film (Harris) this all just lollops along as if it were just the money-no-object pilot episode of a drama series that will struggle to get a commission. I love the genre, but the words barrel, bottom and scraped came to mind pretty early on.

Leno,5.0,"**Not a disaster as others seem to imply but definitely disappointing for a movie of such high budget.**

Morbius is a kind of a vampire Batman-Frankenstein mix. In the search of the cure for a rare and highly-debilitating blood decease, Morbius (a genius doctor) find a cure that has a terrible cost. His sickness is pretty much gone and he attains super powers, but also feel an insatiable lust for blood that can't be fully satiated by artificial blood. 

The movie revolves around Morbius trying to remedy the consequences of the evil he unleashed to the world. While the cinematography is pretty decent, the plot really sucks. In the end of the movie, there are too many open questions (and inconsistencies) in the plot. 

The movie seems to end very abruptly without any decent climax, and many of the secondary characters that I expected would play an important role in the resolution of the conflicts, seem to have been completely forgotten.

r96sk,6.0,"Not even that bad, to be honest.

I had heard murmurs of <em>'Morbius'</em> being received poorly (as now I see via the average rating!) but didn't know to what degree, which is how I prefer it so I can form my own opinion - which is, I didn't dislike it. Admittedly I have nothing that I like either, but it's a forgettably fine film. In fact, I found it to be the quickest viewing experience of the year so far - the run time absolutely flew by for me.

The cast are a bit up-and-down. Jared Leto has a few moments and overall I'm OK with him in the lead role, meanwhile Matt Smith is more miss than hit but again didn't annoy me or anything like that. Elsewhere, it was pleasant to see Jared Harris and Tyrese Gibson in smaller roles.

The special effects, for the most part, are serviceable in my eyes. I think I also heard that people were questioning why the filmmakers didn't opt for prosthetics and went full blown CG for the faces - I found everything in that area to be fine, it would've been cooler if they mixed it up but if I hadn't heard anything about it I honestly would not have even noted it.

There are some lame lines of dialogue, namely that hunger one, and the credit scenes don't leave any excitement or intrigue behind. Aside from that, I genuinely didn't dislike this.

No, he makes and consumes artificial blood for ethical reasons. Who says he needs to kill or hurt people to get what he needs? Horrible premise for his actions, not believable at all. And the rest of the story is the same. Weird decision making, boring, pointless dialogue. The bad guy is suddenly bad lacking any morals because he was bullied once apparently. Vampire powers are a myriad of random things. One time he is able to fly and it is hard to determine why exactly, the movie suggests because a subway train is pushing the air in front of it. Not only is it nonsense, it also looks bad CGI wise.

CrisisDog,8.0,"Honestly, I don't know why this movie has gotten so many bad ratings.  Yes, it's a vampire movie, and I'm not sure how much originality can be squeezed out of that genre anymore.  I am totally -not- a Jared Leto fan from some of his other movies and was hesitant on that behalf to watch this film. But once in, he actually pulls off a very realistic doctor role that is also bitter on life due to his health.  Of course, looking for the solution leads to the bigger story that you could probably guess by now.  I'm also at a point where I'm ""over it"" with a lot of these superhero movies, so it was refreshing to see something different out of the MCU.  If I did have any complaints, there are some unanswered questions at the end, but you know, that always leaves room for a sequel.  However, on top of that, the two end credit scenes just add more ""Huuuh?"" and probably do more damage than good.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,8.0,"I have to say that I quite liked this movie. A bit surprised since it is a new Marvel movie after all. It is even free of woke bull manure which made me even more surprised.

The “scientific” part of Morbius changing his DNA, overnight no less, by means of some serum that he derived from vampire bats is of course utter nonsense but one cannot really complain too much about that since it is straight from the original comic book character.

The story is really simple and not much to write home about but it works in its simplicity. After all, in this kind of movie we really do not need something fancy as long as it is not downright stupid. It only needs to be a vehicle for the action and special effects and for that purpose the story works fine.

I like Morbius. He is intelligent and he doesn’t just sink down in some self pity or whining sessions when he finds out that things did not go exactly as planned. Sure, he is not happy about it but at least he does research into his condition and he actually takes the effort to learn what he can do with his new powers.

I also do like the special effects and the action in general. The bad guy was rather predictable and not really very charismatic but he worked fairly okay. I think that most of the actors made a good enough job actually.

If I should complain about anything it was that scene in the beginning where they claimed that vampire bats could “finish off” big animals in minutes or something. That not what vampire bats do or how they feed. It is of course utter ignorant bull manure by some idiot script writer and it was really totally unnecessary to soil the movie with such nonsense already in the first scenes. I had hoped that ignorant script writers like that died out together with the last flying rubber Piranha in the early 80’s.

Anyway, I quite liked the movie. A lot of movies that I’ve watched lately have felt bloated and too long for the material. This one I actually felt was too short.",2022-08-16T18:27:15.106Z,526896,4 stars,0.7684137225151062

""Everything Everywhere All at Once is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year, finally putting Daniels on the mainstream radar.

With such a low budget, it's almost humiliating that so many expensive Hollywood blockbusters can't even reach the heels of so much originality, imagination, excitement, and emotion. Michelle Yeoh leads the troops in a film that also pays homage to the iconic career of the actress who, at 59 years old, accompanies the fantastic stunt team in truly outlandish fights.

The mother-daughter relationship as the emotional core of the story follows a surprisingly predictable path and needs a few more dialogues to deliver an even more powerful climax, but it still induces tears and a genuine sense of concern for the characters.

It's frankly impossible to adequately evaluate the plot - it lurches, veers, wobbles and meanders all over the shop with precious little linear to guide the viewer. It is a tour de force from Yeoh, well directed and scripted - frequently amusingly - that asks just as many questions as it strenuously attempts to avoid answering.

There is nothing inherently wrong with the movie in general, there was a surface level plot with complex themes at play, which somehow balances the zany world of the multiverse with an intimate connection between mother and daughter. This connection had a nice arch throughout the story but failed to draw me in emotionally. I understood what I should feel in those impactful moments but had a hard time connecting.

The performances were great. Ke Huy Quan was incredible and one of the highlights of the entire movie. His switch from clueless doppy husband to multi-versal warrior had me hysterically laughing. Michelle Yeoh is fantastic and deserving of all her praise and award buzz.

Despite my problems with a lack of connection to the story, the action really raises this movie as a whole. There is something so captivating about 60-year-old women performing incredible complex kung fu against one another. The brutality is superb and incredibly fun to watch. Another layer to the action is the actions our characters must perform to tape into their multi-versal selves. These are crazy, vulgar, and some of the most shocking things I have seen on screen.

Ahmetaslan27,6.0,"**things I liked in the movie and things I didn't like.**

A Chinese immigrant lives in America and embarks on a crazy and strange adventure in multiple universes. This movie should be called the multiverse of madness. The things that were written in ""Doctor Strange 2"" I saw in this movie in terms of the worlds, the characters, and the strange things that happen.

Critics expressed their admiration for this film and it won the admiration of many, but from my point of view, yes, it was enjoyable, but the duration of the movie was unpleasant and long for me. There is a good message in the movie, which is an atmosphere that contains a rush about oneself and how important we are in this universe, at the same time you discover that you aren't important in this universe.

There is a strong emotional factor in the movie, which is the story of a mother with her daughter and the love of the family, but the film sometimes took unexpected comedic paths and was affected by the emotional factor. At the same time, there are things that are supposed to be funny and they actually made many viewers of the film laugh, but at the same time you see Some of the comedy scenes were disgusting and nauseating.

The movie is special and it is one of the best good movies you will see in 2022, but at the same time the movie needed a better balance in terms of comedy and drama in a way that summarizes this is similar to the movie The Matrix, which is a person who can enter another world through his mind. Here you see the idea is similar, but in multiple universes, and you see these multiple universes and you see the options.

This movie makes you think about your personal decisions and makes you think that there are people like you, but in other universes they made decisions that affected you. Here this idea is creative, but what bothered me was the comedic situations at the wrong time. There are emotional scenes that were touching. Great dialogue scenes, but they were damaged by the comedy because sometimes the movie Reminds me of Marvel movies.

The cinematography, editing, and music were wonderful, which was an essential factor in the film's story. The scene of the rocks was eye-catching, wonderful, deep and poignant, but at the same time the director decided to show this story and how he used somewhat disgusting comedic tools. It was something for me that was inappropriate and inappropriate.

Yes, I know that this movie has Hollywood agendas, and this is a large part that contributed to it receiving very high and fabulous ratings, but in general, there are things I liked in the movie and things I didn't like.",2023-09-19T01:39:24.274Z,545611,2 stars,0.45643922686576843
Thimble,5.0,"Thematically, this movie has something to chew on.  Unfortunately the metaphor used to explore the theme is constructed in a sloppy way that falls apart under any scrutiny.  Well performed actions sequences are irrelevant to the progression of the theme and only serve to mark time between the tidbits of character drama spread out over the movie.

The superficial plot and setting similarities to The Matrix also bring these shortcomings into sharp focus.  Whereas the former takes pains to communicate it's ideas to the audience with precise foreshadowing, EEAAO tries to throw as many ideas at you as fast as possible hoping that you won't notice they have no substance, and ultimately don't matter.  The former has action scenes that are relevant to the theme, progress the story, and matter to the character's journey.  The later simply has me waiting until they're over for the story to pick back up.  It's not that there's nothing this movie has to say, it's simply afraid to say it without constant 'lol so random!!' memes.",2023-10-15T01:02:46.762Z,545611,2 stars,0.661239504814148
Filipe Manuel Neto,10.0,"**A magnificently anti-nihilistic and brutally well-executed film, with a cast of deeply committed actors and an insane story.**

I just saw this film and felt an irresistible need to talk about it and comment on it. However, I recognize that a text of just a few thousand characters is completely insufficient to make a fair assessment. This is one of the most complex films I've seen, and so I'm going to try to make an extra effort not to spoil it, even though I feel like I'm going to need to address some things in more depth to be able to write what I need. Let's start by saying that the film was an overwhelming success, both at the box office and with critics, and that it is worth every cent of our cinema ticket. He was also acclaimed at the 2023 Oscars ceremony, with seven statuettes (Best Film, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Editing and Best Original Screenplay) in ten nominations. And in addition to the Oscars, many other prizes and awards that seem completely justified to me.

The script is one of the most creative and insane I've ever seen: it all starts with a middle-aged Chinese lady who tries to deal with the organized chaos of her normal life: a half-bankrupt business, a marriage in ruins, a bad relationship with an authoritarian father and a lesbian and protesting daughter. And problems with income tax. It is in the midst of this that she discovers that there are billions of other universes, with several other versions of the people she knows, and that she needs to help defeat an evil, an evil force that threatens to destroy them all.

The film starts from very bold physics premises, where there are some theories that address the possibility of universes parallel to ours, with our alter-egos living there, and goes further, stating that these universes are born from our multiplicity of options and decisions every day. For example, I'm here writing this, but in another universe, another version of me chose not to watch any movie and sleep. I'm not going to explain much more, not even how the main character discovers this, nor what kind of evil entity that is, but I can say that, deep down, the biggest message I took away from this film is the need to live in the present, but also have faith and cultivate love and good feelings, instead of futile sensations or meaningless nihilism. In effect, the main character needs to believe in herself and in the abilities she doesn't know she can have, in order to combat that malevolent force, which is, in itself, a good representation of nihilism, the feeling that nothing in this life it's really worth it. Still regarding the script, I believe it is fair to say that it was precisely closer to the end that I felt the inspiration running out, the creative overdose of the directors and screenwriters. This is, after so many bizarre and unusual things, the apparently simple ending (even though it wasn't) seemed strangely anti-climactic to me.

There's so much to say about the technical aspects of this film... directed by Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan, it's a surprisingly cheap production (a budget of around thirty million dollars, for Hollywood and considering what this film is, it's a small bag of pennies and quarters), which works incredibly well. On a visual level, it's one of the most devastating films I've ever seen, with cinematography and editing worthy of being studied by film schools. And then, we have the great work of designing sets and costumes, and the impressive work of the action doubles and makeup, among many other subtle details that are so tiny that we almost don't notice them, and that show the detailed, patient nature and commitment of directors and their team. The soundtrack is also a very positive point, with an atmospheric and sometimes very discreet sound. There are lots of references to aspects of pop culture, such as martial arts or even technological gadgets, and the fight and action scenes were made with maximum attention to detail, including sudden stops of the image in the most intense scenes, a style of cinematography very characteristic of kung fu films.

The work of the cast deserves praise. By playing a wide range of cinema styles in the same character, from comedy to physical action, Michelle Yeoh embarked on a tour de force so challenging that it would make any renowned actor think twice. The way she gives herself to the character is total, absorbing. Stephanie Hsu follows her closely and offers us profound work, full of feeling and emotion. Ke Huy Quan is also impressive and does a remarkable job. In smaller characters but still worthy of mention, we have the veteran James Hong, and the prestigious Jamie Lee Curtis, in a performance so far out of her comfort zone that it seems unimaginable for this actress, and yet it could become pivotal to her career from now on.",2024-04-15T08:45:03.276Z,545611,2 stars,0.33246734738349915
cineast78,4.0,"**Bloated nonsense, overlong and meaningless.**

If this movie wasn't so overhyped and so overrated, I would just dismiss it as a meh kind of movie. But as it is so overhyped and overrated, I kind of start to hate it.

But to not waste a lot more time on this nonsense, I will just point out the main reasons why the movie failed for me.

1.) The movie failed to establish an emotional connection between the viewer and what is happening on the screen i. E. in the movie. One of the reasons for that being: the movie was driven by nonsense. Whenever the main characters are stuck in a situation, the have to perform some nonensical bullcrap, so that they can crazy-deus-ex-machina their way out of the situation. Again and again and again and again and again.

2.) The other reason for the failed emotional connection is that there were no sympathetic characters given to connect with. Everyone is just a self-absorbed a-hole or douchebag. What they are fighting for is a chaotic piled up mess (because they are unable to fix anything and to improve, so they prefer having a meanignless mess to having nothing).

So, my main problem was: I just didn't care for anything happening in the movie.

If you think that it is a profound philosophical question to ask how your life would be if you would have sausages for fingers (just to give you an example), this may be a movie you. But if you think that such a question is just stupid and stopped being funny since you turned 8 years old, maybe you should avoid spending timeor money on this movie.

But there are some few reddeming qualities of this movie, hence I gave it 4/10.

Which are:

- The cinematography isn't bad.

- It doesn't look like a trash movie production-value-wise.

- Some of the acting wasn't too bad, if you can look past the garbage mess the actors had to work with.

- It has some funny moments, if you can take the nonsense and the stupidity.

But again, at the end of the day, I didn't care for the pile of nonsense that the movie is.",2024-11-12T01:20:30.213Z,545611,1 star,0.42036348581314087

""The Lost City is one of this year's surprises, managing to vary the well-known formulas of the genre in a creative, fun manner.

By making the most of the hilarious, chemistry-filled performances from Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock, the Nee brothers explore the distinct protagonists, Alan and Loretta, beyond what's expected in generic rom-coms, developing their misleading appearances through a genuinely exciting adventure.

Unfortunately, only the main character arcs receive this level of care, as everything secondary lacks the same interesting treatment and better entertainment. Still, a thematically rich ending compensates for any cliches.

Definitely, a family viewing party recommendation.""

Nathan,6.0,"_The Lost City_ is an action-adventure rom-com combo that has more action than comedy. While there are plenty of laughs to be had throughout the film, a large percentage of them missed the mark completely. There were scenes that had me laughing aloud and others that were a little cringe at times, so the humor levels will for sure vary per viewer. The overall plot was somewhat standard but entertaining enough as comedy plots are concerned. The beginning starts off strong and then slowly fades as the plot becomes more unbelievable. The acting is excellent, as it should be with this type of star power. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum had spectacular comedic chemistry and bounced off each other nicely. Daniel Radcliffe’s over the top villain antics were fairly decent as well, nothing groundbreaking. Brad Pitt was a standout, and I wish we saw more of him in this film, but his scenes by far were the most memorable. Even though this movie has its ups and downs, it understands what it is, and does not take itself seriously. This translates to the audience not taking it seriously as well, which results in a fairly fun viewing experience.

The Lost City is a goofy adventure with shades of romantic comedy, much like Romancing The Stone back in 1984 but with the absurdity and the laughs cranked up to 10. The movie basically revolves around Channing Tatum’s hilarious reaction to every peril and danger. Sandra Bullock charms as always, and Daniel Radcliffe’s kooky villain entertains but the best part of the film is Brad Pitt’s over-the-top hero. His character is a gut-busting foil to Tatum’s attempts to impress Sandra Bullock. The Lost City has plenty of funny moments and laughs but feels overly familiar like I have seen it all in other movies. I enjoyed The Lost City and recommend it, but I wish it did more to feel unique than rely on Tatum’s wacky antics and Pitt’s uproarious cameo.",2022-10-08T00:30:18.906Z,752623,3 stars,0.5820591449737549

And it was. We have seen this so many times it spawned a cliche about going broke.

The characters have no chemistry because they aren't supposed to be real people, they are supposed to be checked boxes interacting with other checked boxes.... yawn... like every other movie and TV show made in the past few years.

The plot is boring because people have seen the movie it is blatantly ripping off of, and because of that, they have seen the plot work in a far better movie that doesn't put political statements above entertainment.

She is taken to an island where her archaeological skills are needed to find a treasure hidden in a lost tomb. Sage's cover model Alan (Channing Tatum), mercenary Jack (Brad Pitt), and Sage's publisher Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) try to come to Loretta's aid. This riff on ""Romancing the Stone"" and a few other Hollywood projects about writers shouldn't work this well. The screenplay credit is messy, but Bullock uses her impeccable comic timing to deliver. Tatum brings more to the ""dumb guy"" role than was required, Pitt should have had more fun with his pretty boy/mercenary role, and Radcliffe doesn't get lost in the shuffle. Harrison, as Sage's social media ambassador, steals her scenes from the name performers. Randolph is good, but like Pitt, I wanted more from her character. The Nee brothers' direction is heavy on technology. The color correction and lighting are harsh, and some of the special effects aren't convincing. The pacing has more fits and starts than my first used car, so when a running gag or set-piece lands, it's more successful than it should have been. Alan has a great scene with Loretta after she refers to her romance fiction as shlock, and he sets her straight about disrespecting the audience who loves her stories.

Ti West (In a Valley of Violence) returns six years after his last feature film with a clear vision of a story that mixes uninhibited pornography with the purest gore that can be found on the big screen, all wrapped up in a constantly captivating narrative and insane third act.

Mia Goth (Emma) shines tremendously with an imperceptible dual role that transforms a technically interesting movie into something truly impressive - makeup, visual/practical effects, and score deserve much praise.

Louisa Moore - Screen Zealots,7.0,"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**

Ti West is a great visual director, and you can count on his films looking polished and amazing. Such is the case with “X,” the first film in his series of slashers (including the prequel, “Pearl,” and the upcoming “MaXXXine,” which is currently in development). While “X” was released first, I would still recommend watching “Pearl” beforehand. Either order is fine, but I think screening the prequel and keeping the actual story timeline in order makes the most sense if you’re just starting out. “X” features grindhouse style horror that offers an homage to 1970s classics like “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” but the film also lends a unique, fresh spin on the genre.

The year is 1979, and aspiring adult film actress Maxine Minx (Mia Goth) is joined by her cast and crew (Brittany Snow, Kid Cudi, Jenna Ortega, Owen Campbell, and Martin Henderson) to make a different kind of pornographic picture. The group ventures to a remote farmhouse in rural Texas to shoot their film, but something feels “off” about the elderly property owners Howard and Pearl (Stephen Ure and Goth, in a dual role). Their reclusive hosts are unaware of what’s going on out back until they catch the performers in the act. This sets off a chain of very violent events that has everyone fighting for their lives.

The retro horror setting serves the story well, even if it has the most basic of plots. What makes this script (penned by West) stand out is the dry humor and interesting, well-written characters that have a lot of depth. It doesn’t take long to start to like and care for these people, which makes their inevitable demise hit a little harder. West’s script includes themes of aging, ambition, voyeurism, and jealousy, all tied together with the joy of setting yourself free from repression. Stifled desire causes the elderly couple to begin their killing spree, but there is so much more underneath the carnage.

The film features explicit bloody violence, gore, nudity, and sex, earning its hard “R” rating. West doesn’t turn his camera from the bloodshed even when the audience instinctively looks away. If you aren’t accustomed to horror, this film may not be for you.

The cast is comprised of terrific indie actors who trust their director onscreen and off, which shows in their work. Being able to feel so free in front of the camera makes it an easier task to also stand behind it, and all of this results in great entertainment for the audience. The movie is fun and smart, if uncomplicated.

“X” ends with a wholly satisfying finale and avoids the pitfalls of frustrating the audience, as so many independent horror films seem to do. It’s a slower burn for sure, but what a rewarding ride.",2023-04-23T06:25:20.618Z,760104,3 stars,0.49368008971214294
tmdb51616167,1.0,"I will be doing a combined review for the two films, ""X"" and ""Pearl.""

Upon seeing the high ratings given by both the general public and critics to these movies, I am left puzzled about what truly makes a good film.

Let's start with ""X,"" a movie that I found to be absolutely terrible. The film revolves around pornography rather than a cohesive storyline, resulting in a disjointed and atrocious viewing experience. The cinematography, acting, storytelling, and writing were all subpar, yet critics inexplicably praised it.

The attempt to elevate the film with Jenna Ortega fell short, as she had minimal screen time amidst excessive male and adult nudity, making it unsuitable for general viewing. This is a movie best watched in private, not recommended by me at all.

Moving on to ""Pearl,"" I was equally disappointed as it also relied heavily on sexual themes. The film took a bizarre turn, culminating in a scene that made me walk out of the theater in disbelief.

It's baffling to see these films receive acclaim, especially when performances like Mia Goth's are lacking. It seems that the current focus is on titillation rather than genuine storytelling.

As we await the verdict on the third film, it appears that the world may be more interested in gratification than meaningful narratives.",2024-09-02T18:58:19.001Z,760104,2 stars,0.5822442173957825
RalphRahal,7.0,"X by Ti West is definitely a unique take on the slasher genre. The story feels fresh and unlike anything I’ve seen before, making it a solid introduction to something new. The acting by all the characters was good, not perfect, but strong enough to carry the film. It didn’t blow me away, but it worked well with the story.

The plot itself is very straightforward and easy to follow, but it takes a bit too long to get going. The first act feels stretched out, with not much happening until later, and it’s a little unclear when the first act transitions into the second. That pacing could’ve been tighter, but once the story picks up, things really start moving, and the payoff is worth it.

Visually, the film nails the 1970s vibe with gritty yet polished cinematography that draws you in. An interesting choice is the use of the 1.37:1 and the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, which enhances the viewing experience. Overall, it’s a solid horror movie with a unique spin, even if it has its pacing flaws. It’s definitely worth a watch if you’re into stylish, slow-burn horror.",2025-01-05T01:42:12.897Z,760104,4 stars,0.7822591066360474
r96sk,10.0,"<em>'X'</em>... I didn't see that coming! Admittedly, I practically came in fully blind, but still. It's not only an impressively stylish movie, it's an absolutely wild ride from beginning to completion. A fantastic horror slasher, it's brought to life superbly on and 'off' screen.

Mia Goth brings an excellent performance, that one scream fails to escape my memory... co-star Jenna Ortega matches her in that department though, perhaps even surpasses. I've known Goth by name for a while, but this is the first movie of hers that I've logged.

Ortega herself is very good too, as are all of the others in this 2022 release. Brittany Snow does well, is it just me (probably) that sees a facial resemblance to Christine Lakin? (shoutout anyone who watched <em>'Internet Icon'</em> featuring her back in the day).

Scott Mescudi (aka Kid Cudi, that <i>one</i> shot is a madness btw 😂 *insert Rowley Jefferson gif here*). Martin Henderson, Owen Campbell and Stephen Ure play their part too. The deaths are awesome - super well done. The one with the secondary eye pop edit got me squeamish; the editing is top tier.

Just looked up the filming locations for this... New Zealand?! I was totally convinced that the farm was the same one used for <em>'The Walking Dead'</em>. Aside from a few differences, the house and barn match my (admittedly fading) memory of Hershel's digs. Clearly not!

Lastly, I did not even realise, until looking at the Wikipedia article in fact, that Goth played Pearl as well... crazy prosthetics! That does make the eponymous follow-up's cover make a lot more sense (given I knew it was a prequel), I was questioning that until this very moment.",2025-04-08T00:57:47.176Z,760104,4 stars,0.5460199117660522

The trophy is to be presented to the icon of decency ""Professor Marmalade"" but is he quite who he seems? Is the governor? These films are a bit ten-a-penny, and this one isn't really very special. The dialogue is entertainingly quick-fire now and again (especially the snake and the piranha); ""Weaps"" - the extra nimble taratunla provides the gadgetry and the animation is efficient with plenty of action once the film gets moving.

They even added multiple 'twists' to make the story more unpredictable, but almost all of them were far-fetched and failed to surprise me.

Despite that, this movie was a breath of originality from Dreamworks after a decade of bland animations. I'll give it a solid 8.",2022-04-15T15:47:15.557Z,629542,4 stars,0.9250599145889282

""The Bad Guys is one of the lightest, most pleasant, genuinely positive viewings of the year. With a clear distinction between being ""good"" and ""bad"", stereotypes and preconceived notions are brilliantly addressed in a sweet redemption story that doesn't try to reinvent the wheel.

The voice cast is exceptional, elevating an admittedly formulaic narrative in a remarkably impactful manner. Despite being more geared towards children, the entertainment levels are high enough for any generation. The blend of 2D and 3D animation works flawlessly, offering an overall distinct look compared to what audiences are used to.

In the end, it's yet another recommendation for families.""

""Deep Water sells itself as an erotic thriller, but it lacks precisely those same components. Adrian Lyne tries to make a comeback after a twenty-year absence from cinema, but Zach Helm and Sam Levinson's screenplay holds too many problems.

The protagonists couldn't be more awful people in an incredibly toxic relationship that's frustrating to watch, but their lack of development and inexistent arcs make the narrative feel repetitive, predictable, and lacking intensity.

The messy approach to the secondary characters and subplots contributes to an absolutely disastrous script, where not even a traditional third act can be found.

In the end, Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas are actually good, so there's something to appreciate.""

Unfortunately for him, though, she wants - well, has - more of an open marriage than he might like. Indeed, she frequently all but flaunts her usually handsome and younger lovers in front of him and their friends. When one of her coterie goes missing,""Vic"" tells his successor ""Jonas"" (Dash Mihok) that he killed him with an hammer. True or false? Soon rumours abounds, made worse when one of her other beaux ""Charlie"" (Jacob Elordi) is found floating in the pool! Is he the culprit? Well, to be honest I didn't care. Affleck is nowhere near his best with this preposterous nonsense. Ana de Arias has done some stinkers lately, and this is just the latest. Just taking her clothes off and swearing provocativly isn't acting. The ending is hilariously bad and all told this is just a poor effort from a declining Adrian Lyne that is as forgettable as it is terrible.

tmdb28039023,7.0,"Jealousy is such a living hell that Claude Chabrol made arguably the definitive film on the subject and literally called it L’Enfer. This is an area of human relations with which Deep Water director Adrian Lyne is very comfortable, having previously directed Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal, Lolita (which I find superior to Kubrick’s version), and Unfaithful (loosely based on Chabrol's La Femme Infidèle. Coincidence?). To call this a retread is somewhat of an understatement, but Lyne is wise to have chosen familiar territory for his return from a 20-year break from directing.

Deep Water is likewise a good career move for Ben Affleck; it gets him back on track after he followed the great The Way Back with The Last Duel and The Tender Bar (although Deep Water would have preceded all those films had it not been for covid-related delays; funny how things work). Here is a movie that allows him to give a subtly nuanced performance, and he doesn’t disappoint, taking passive-aggressiveness and elevating it into an art form.

Affleck now joins his BFF Matt Damon as actors who have shined in roles based on characters created by Patricia Highsmith (and indeed this is how one might imagine Tom Ripley’s married life to be). Ana de Armas is also quite good as Melinda, Vic’s (Affleck) wife, a thoroughly despicable bitch on wheels whose only redeeming quality is Vic’s unconditional love for her.

Oh, he loves her with almost all his heart. I say ‘almost’ because his heart may or may not be able to pump enough blood to a certain other organ – thus it is tacitly agreed that Melinda has the freedom to find solace elsewhere, usually in the arms of intellectually challenged younger men. This arrangement is no secret among the couple’s friends because Melinda is also an alcoholic with zero self-awareness.

Vic dismisses the whole thing in public with a blend of dry wit, deadpan sarcasm, and self-deprecating humor (which provides some of the best dialogue in the film) that can turn ambiguously menacing at the drop of hat, especially when he finds himself alone with one of Melinda’s boytoys.

In addition to Chabrol, Lyne puts me in mind of iconoclastic British filmmaker Peter Greenaway – and not just because Vic’s pet snails remind me of A Zed & Two Noughts. I generally find movies where characters literally get away with murder in one way or another to be immoral; the few exceptions to this rule include films like Greenaway's in which there is no conventional morality to speak of in the first place. In Deep Water, no major, plot-relevant character is innocent, and they all get what they deserve – even when, like Vic, they get what they want.",2022-08-28T02:44:41.250Z,619979,4 stars,0.47198721766471863

CinemaSerf,5.0,"So here's the gist. ""Will"" (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) needs $231,000 urgently, so he taps up his brother ""Danny"" (Jake Gyllenhaal) who, as luck would have it, is on that very day about to hit a bank for $32m. All he has to do is drive and his worries are a thing of the past. They manage to relieve the bank of the cash ok, but horny young police officer ""Zach"" (Jackson White) becomes a fly in their ointment when he decides to ask one of the cashiers out on a date, and gets caught up in the now much more precarious raid. He gets shot, and as the ambulance is leaving to take him to hospital the two robbers jump on board as their ticket out of the now police-strewn crime scene. Luckily, onboard the ambulance, is feisty no-nonsense paramedic ""Cam"" (Eiza González) who now has to keep the critically ill officer alive whilst her two passengers try to evade the might of the LAPD with their loot. What now ensues is just ridiculous. This sixteen tonne truck manages to evade snipers, souped-up police cars, helicopters all whilst having a critically injured man in the back. It seems to have no issues running out of gas; and must have an axle and suspension system that wouldn't be out of place on a Boeing 747. Gung-go police captain ""Monroe"" (Garret Dillahunt) demonstrates adequately that the more resources you have, the cockier you become - and the less successful; and the introduction of FBI man ""Anson"" (Keir O'Donnell) a college pal of ""Danny"" who has to rush from a marriage guidance session with his husband to try and apprehend the fugitives just tops off this rather preposterous narrative. The production is very good; the use of drones and high speed photography does create an effective image as the ambulance continues to evade pursuit, but the dialogue is dreadful. Lots of repetitive expressions with hardly a smile to be had as the plot descends willingly into the absurd. Luckily, we get to come up for air for a moment or so thanks to Christoper Cross' ""Sailing"" but otherwise this is a relentless chase movie with it's root firmly placed in fantasy.

Car chases and gun fights must have been directed by an action flick newbie, never even once is the cause and effect in the same frame. Looking at people shooting something off-screen and in the next scene seeing bullets hit another thing does nothing for me. Might as well read a book if I'm supposed to connect the dots myself. Similarly watching cars drive fast in close-ups or over hidden ramps is just boring. Dialogue wants to be clever so much and characters are overly colorful, not very believable on the whole.

The writing also was pretty poor including the cringe ""comedic"" lines that didn't work, not to mention a few unnecessary scenes for the supporting characters. I guess on the plus side Jake Gyllenhaal can play psychotic pretty well and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II has his moments.

""Ambulance is one of the most frenetic, literally non-stop action flicks of Michael Bay's entire career - which might be shocking to state. The cast is exceptional - curiously, it's Eiza González who stands out the most - and their interactions are far more hilarious than I anticipated.

Choppy editing and inconsistently shaky camera work can be extremely frustrating, especially outside of the action sequences, but on the other hand, these elements also contribute to the unstoppable energy of an authentic blockbuster.

Per Gunnar Jonsson,3.0,"This is a Michael Bay movie. I could probably stop the review here because that says all about the movie. Lots of special effects and a mediocre story at best.

This Michael Bay movie is no different. The two stars I gave it is solely for the action and the special effects. The script is not even mediocre. It is rubbish.

I think what grated on me the most is that there are two characters in the whole movie that are somewhat likable. The rest are either assholes or idiots. Mostly both.

The actions of almost everyone are just annoyingly stupid and illogical. The constant bickering and shouting is frustrating. This “criminal mastermind”, Danny Sharp, is alternating between being a psychopath and just an idiot. His idiot comment towards the end that they were not the bad guys, they were just trying to get home was so braindead it was unbelievable. The police force is not really any better.

The entire chase part is just so ridiculous most of the time and the constant shouting and arguing drags it down further. The idea of doing an operation, over the phone, during a high speed chase while taking 90 degree turns every two minutes or so is laughable.

Then they had all this silly work up to where the baddies were going to assault the cops with their customized vehicles and the one time I expected Michael Bay to shine and even go a bit over the top it ended up being rather meh and mediocre.

Normally I do not really care that much if the script is not top notch in these kind of movies as long as it is good enough to drive the action but this script was too ludicrous and devoid of intelligence even for me.",2022-09-18T08:33:57.595Z,763285,2 stars,0.9731325507164001
Benzasayz,-1.0,"The Adam Project is a sci-fi movie that takes you on a wild, CGI-filled flight that is out of this world-with futuristic technology that makes you excited but also afraid of what could come, The sci-fi elements look so realistic - as realistic as those can be - that it gives the impression that the cinematographers used time travel themselves to capture these scenes.

Exceptional fight scenes that defy gravity. This film also takes you into some very realistic topics, too, like grieving for a loved one, being bullied by classmates and accepting who you are.

Ryan Reynolds is in front of us with the same character he has been playing for the last 15 years.
What really surprises me is the harmony of someone like Reynolds, who was in front of the camera with the world's greatest actors and actresses, with Walker Scobell, who had his first acting experience at the age of 12.  They made a great duo team.

The overall storyline of the movie is creative, but it does not really have any unique plot twists nor is it fully developed. And as a result, this film comes off a little bland and seems to be missing something.

It doesn't promise much as it is what we've always been seeing but it's pretty good at delivering what it promises. 
Long story short, 'The Adam Project' is a movie made to entertain the audience and it succeeds.

If you're someone who's presently in the mood to take a -Welcome- Break from all the doom and gloom on the news right now and watch a movie that comes **""FULL-CIRCLE""** in the most Enthralling, Engaging, and indeed -{ Heartwarming }- of ways . . . then I wish to -Wholeheartedly- recommend ""The Adam Project"", **( TAP for short ),** to you. The only -Other- cinematic experience I've had where a film came Full-Circle in -Such- beautiful fashion, in -Recent- memory at least, would be the simply Fabulous ""SpiderMan: No Way Home"" **( ""SM-NWH"" ).** It is a picture that literally ( And -Very- Cleverly ) ties up loose ends within the -{ Entire }- Spiderman CANON of films, from as far back as 2002. It also just happens to be the -Last- Massive Blockbuster that I reviewed ; before going on an -Entirely- unplanned, ( but -Incredibly- refreshing ) 'Extended 101-day hiatus from reviewing'.

Ok, so if you thought that the 13 yr. old ""Newcomer"" of said film, pint-sized thespian  Walker Scobell was a tremendous -Dramatic- actor, well, then you'd only be -Half- right. The fact of the mater is... he's also a terrific **-COMEDIC-** talent, with seriously ""Impeccable"" timing, especially given that this is, get this ...his -{ First Ever }- movie or TV ( 'Feature' ) appearance. Factor Walker's ""Super-Fun"" performance in alongside a 'full spectrum' of absolute **-{ ""POWERHOUSE!"" }-** deliveries from the film's unequivocal ensemble principal cast of Protagonists ( Zoe Saldaña, Ryan Reynolds, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner,  ) . . . then add in some absolutely -Fantastic- ( & truly state of the art ) CGI, a genuinely -Mindblowing- grand finale set piece ...and the kind of fight choreography that you really have to -See- ...to believe . . . & you have a seriously, seriously exciting picture, indeed.

Not to mention **FUNNY AS HELL!!!** I really hadn't laughed so hard in a long time ; -since- ( about the 3rd time ) I watched SM-NWH, to be precise. On the downside, though . . . & if I'm to be 'painfully' honest . . . -Both- the Villain ( ...don't get me wrong, the person who plays the main 'baddie' is a Veteran performer ; I just felt like the Writing there could have been just that ""Little Bit Stronger""... ) -And- her 'ever loyal' henchman are a 'tad weak', as is the very title of the film, itself. Even something as ( relatively ) simple as **""FLASH-BACK-FORWARD"",** would have been -{ Far }- catchier than its existing name, ( although I do think I sorta understand -Why- they called it what they did, for what it's worth ). It's for these two reasons -Alone- that I -Didn't- give it my trademark ""25/10"" ; reserved especially for movies That Move Me **-{ VERY }-** Deeply, as TAP ( ...quite obviously... ) -Did-.

Summary: This is a picture that, ( among -several- other things ), pointedly asks the question: If you could -{ Somehow }- go back in time, & talk to your Younger-Self... **""WHAT'D YOU SAY?""** ...& in the most -Intriguing- of ways, at that. Furthermore, having lost my Dearly Beloved Father when I was -Just- 13, in a horrible, brutal car crash, TAP resonated with me **PROFOUNDLY.** It is has some Genuinely **""TENDER""** Moments, &  does a **-Phenomenal-** job of addressing the issue of 'Estranged Father-Son Relationships' the world over, but most especially in the USA ; ( where the film is also -Set- ) ; and where the issue is quite possibly now almost at epidemic levels, what with the country's sky-high divorce rate, separation rate, & just plain old 'Absentee Father-ism', in general. All said & done, the  **""EVER-DYNAMIC!** Duo"" of Actor Ryan Reynolds & Director Shawn Levy have well & truly ""Done it Again"".

Nathan,7.0,"Despite having shades of _Back to the Future_, _The Adam Project_ finds a way to pave its own path to deliver a fun and heartwarming story about self-forgiveness. The movie starts incredibly strong, introducing the viewer to the main characters. The chemistry between the two actors is fantastic and feels really genuine, creating an instant connection between the two and the audience. Walker Scobell does an excellent job doing his best Ryan Reynolds impersonation, making me really buy into the fact that they are the same character. This pace carries on up until the second act when characters and lore are being thrown at the viewer left and right. This section feels incredibly rushed resulting in the viewer having very little emotional connection with the ideas introduced. Zoe Saldana and Mark Ruffalo do a fantastic job with the limited screen time that they have, it was great seeing them outside of their standard CGI suits (looking at you Marvel). The antagonist wore her welcome towards the end of the film as her antics seemed a little forced. The comedy in this movie was done fairly well. I enjoyed the fast sarcastic nature of the boy and his back and forth with Reynolds, but some jokes did fall flat. But that is par for the course in any comedy. Overall, this film was enjoyable and even though it had its faults I appreciated the concepts it delivered.

I got enough enjoyment from <em>'The Adam Project'</em>. It isn't anything special as the film is missing a certain sort of spark to it, though the story is fun and allows for some interesting and rather sweet scenes; the latter is particularly true for the conclusion, which is well produced.

Reynolds himself is solid in the lead role, his performance is more serious than funny but there are still a fair amount of amusing moments for him across the 100 or so minutes. Walker Scobell gives a good showing behind the main man, his comedic timing in the first few scenes really does mirror Reynolds'.

Elsewhere on the cast, Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldaña and Jennifer Garner are decent. I will say that I found the antagonists a bit weak in this, I wasn't all that interested in them or their side of the plot. Better villains would've heightened my enjoyment, for sure.

It is in no way original; the plot is terribly predictable with the baddie's identity written pretty large right from the start and though entertaining enough, all the action scenes have such a disappointing inevitability about them. It takes quite a while to build up a head of steam, which doesn't really help it either as the whole thing could easily condense down into a decent fifty minute action thriller. It's a competent made for telly movie that I doubt even it's writers can remember now.",2022-06-02T14:43:31.374Z,628900,2 stars,0.5553343296051025
garethmb,-1.0,"The digital animation geniuses at Pixar are back with “Turning Red” and it marks a departure for the studio known for the “Toy Story” and “Cars”, franchises.

Set in 1990s Toronto, the film centers around 8th grader Mei (Rosalie Chiang), who considers herself an adult at 13 and eagerly applies herself to school when she is not helping her family tour business at a local Temple or hanging with her friends.

Life comes crashing to a halt when after a traumatic day of embarrassment; Mei awakens in the form of a large Red Panda. In a panic, Mei attempts to hide her situation which causes her over-protective mother to assume it is Puberty related and that her hormones are kicking in.

Mei desperately wants to get her life back to normal and learns that as long as she is calm her Panda is under control. However, this proves to be harder than expected and soon Mei learns that the Panda is the result of a family bloodline but there is a way to end it during a Lunar ceremony in a couple of weeks.

Chaos soon follows as Mei struggles with her situation and must find a way to cope with the changes that are going on and make some very important decisions about her life and her future.

The film is a difficult one to review for me as never having been a teenage girl dealing with puberty, raging estrogen, and the issues that go with it.  That being said the film struggles to find a balance as it tacks on the capers of Mei in Panda form without being overly funny or charming and keeps the focus on Teen Angst, puberty-related issues and becoming an adult.

The film lacks the interesting characters, charm, and appeal that have set the foundation for so many Pixar films and it is surprising that a company that can elicit a range of emotions in an animated short fail to really connect with their latest feature. There were some amusing parts but the film as a whole was rather dull and lacked much in the way of humor and was very predictable.

The decision to put the film directly on Disney+ as the studio’s recent “Soul” and “Luca” was raised some controversy but in the end, I do believe it was the right decision as “Turning Red” is not likely to be a film that draws people to the cinema beyond the opening weekend.

It is a film that is a bold step for the company, but one that lacks the charm and humor of previous films as not everyone is going to want to sit through a feature-length film on teenage angst and dealing with changing bodies and the emotional turmoil that follows.  However, the target audience is likely to connect with the characters and it will be interesting to see what the reaction to the film is long-term.

""Turning Red is undoubtedly the riskiest, possibly the most divisive work in Pixar history. Without any remorse or restraint, Domee Shi and Julia Cho unapologetically approach the sensitive topic of (female) puberty in a quite shocking, positively impactful manner.

A narrative that unquestionably explores the hormonal, emotional, and sexual developments of its characters, conveying a message of self-acceptance and understanding of human evolution through its metaphors loaded with youthful excitement.

With the well-known technical attributes from the successful studio, this film will serve as an essential companion for all pre-teens who will deal with or are going through this inevitable and ""inconvenient"" phase of life.

One of the best movies of the year until this day.""

Filipe Manuel Neto,6.0,"**Pixar discovered anime and is looking to conquer the eastern box office.**

I had some expectations regarding this film. I don't know exactly what I expected, but I think everyone will understand if I say that the film is signed by Disney and Pixar, two studios with an enviable track record of successes. However, as soon as the film ended, I felt that I wasn't exactly the target audience for this film: male, over thirty, European, with little connection with pop culture or the anime world.

The film follows a young teenager, daughter of Chinese parents, in a somewhat cathartic experience in which she transforms into a friendly red panda. The film focuses on this transformation and turns it into a metaphor for a transformation called puberty, a discovery of one's own individuality and autonomy, particularly with regard to the relationship with one's parents.

The film is good, but the theme is… complicated. If it is absolutely true that most teenage girls will see themselves in some of the adventures that Mei experiences, it is no less true that many parents and guardians will face the topic with discomfort and raise some objections regarding a certain “apology of rebellion” that the film suggests. On a positive note, it was the first time I saw an animated film aimed at young audiences that addressed menstruation bluntly. The dialogues continue to insist, however, on that stereotype of the panicking teenager and the mother disturbed by the moment and insisting that, now, her daughter is a woman. This is stupid and conveys inaccurate ideas: a woman is a woman from before birth, from a biological point of view, and becomes a woman from a psychological and social point of view long after her first menstruation, when she begins to be old enough and mature enough to make their own decisions (the same applies to men, with the necessary reservations). In addition to these problems, the plot seems a little incipient to me, following paths that are quite obvious, opting for predictable solutions and creating basic characters. I could even talk about the amount of stereotypes about Chinese and Orientals present in this film… but do I need to talk about that?

The best thing about the film is the animations and the extraordinary quality of the drawings and effects. Pixar does not miss the opportunity to defend its credits and reputation in digital animation and offers us a feast for the eyes, with a realism and attention to detail that is difficult to overcome and that makes us think about the way technology has evolved in just a few years: “Toy Story” isn’t even thirty years old yet, and it already seems a little dated! Just one problem: I'm not a fan of anime at all. I think it's a very stylized, excessive, exaggerated type of animation. Unfortunately, this film adopts too many elements that are imported from the anime. Look at the eyes, the exaggeratedly large mouths, the sudden changes in the characters' poses or attitudes... you can't have one foot in two worlds at the same time.",2023-10-15T11:08:53.836Z,508947,3 stars,0.46753987669944763

RalphRahal,5.0,"Fresh (2022) is an interesting mix of horror and dark humor, taking a different approach to the usual thriller setup. The plot starts off engaging, following a modern dating experience that quickly spirals into something unexpected. While the premise isn’t exactly new, the way it unfolds keeps things unsettling enough to hold attention. It does lose some of its sharpness as it goes on, leaning a little too much on familiar horror tropes, but it still manages to keep things entertaining. The writing is decent, though some character decisions feel out of place, making certain moments less believable than they should be.

The directing is solid, with a good balance of tension and style. There’s an interesting use of close-up shots that add to the unease without feeling forced. The cinematography stands out, using lighting and framing to create an eerie atmosphere that matches the film's tone. The sound design and score do their job well, adding to the creep factor without being overbearing. It’s not the kind of movie where the music steals the show, but it complements the visuals nicely.

Acting-wise, Daisy Edgar-Jones carries the film effortlessly, making her character feel natural and relatable even when the script stumbles. Sebastian Stan brings a fun and unsettling energy to his role, making the dynamic between the two leads work well. Some of the supporting cast feel a bit underdeveloped, but the main performances keep things engaging. Overall, Fresh is an entertaining watch that delivers just enough tension and style to stand out. And while the story may not be entirely original, at least some parts of it are very well done… just not overcooked.",2025-03-07T21:17:53.616Z,787752,4 stars,0.7346687316894531
garethmb,-1.0,"“The Batman” Is A Very Engaging And Unforgettable Tale That Is One Of The Best Adaptations Of The Character Ever

In 1989 Michael Keaton was seen as a very controversial choice to wear the Cowl of Batman but soon proved his doubters wrong by turning “Batman” and its subsequent sequel “Batman Returns” into massive Box Office success before leaving the cape behind.

While four other actors have taken up the cinematic version of the character in the subsequent years, Keaton has remained for many the Gold Standard with Christian Bale likely being his biggest rival.

When Robert Pattinson was named as the new Batman, there was interest but concern as an actor who is largely known for playing Edward in the “Twilight” films seemed to be an odd choice. However, I would say that anyone who has seen some of his recent work including his performance in “The Lighthouse” would be playing him a disservice by saying he was not up to the part.

In “The Batman”, audiences are given a darker and more broken Bruce Wayne, an Emo recluse who is far from the Socialite he has been portrayed as for decades and a very sullen and withdrawn individual who does not exude charm or grace and even shows issues making eye-contact.

When the Mayor of Gotham is killed shortly before the election by a mysterious individual known as “The Riddler” (Paul Dano), the vigilante known as “The Batman” is called in to help the police by Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright).  Gordon has been working with Batman for some time but it is clear that his association with him has not won him any favors with his fellow officers, many of which openly question his use and involvement in the crime scenes.

Further complicating matters are clues left at the various crime locales that are addressed to The Batman and cause many to believe that he may be working with the very killer they are attempting to stop.

As the investigation unfolds, the seedy side of Gotham City comes to light in the form of a missing girl who was photographed with the married Mayor and may well be the key to the investigation. Her disappearance leads her friend Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), to take on her Catwoman persona and delve deep into an underworld that features deadly individuals ranging from Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), and The Penguin (Colin Farrell), amongst others as she and the Batman conduct their own investigations that at times overlap and further complicate matters.

As the body count rises and Batman races to find the true method behind the madness of The Riddler, the tone becomes darker and more sinister in a deadly race against time.

The film eschews the usual abundance of action sequences and glossy special effects which are common for Comic Book related films and instead gives audiences a slow-burning murder mystery that holds your attention from start to finish over its three-hour run time.

The dark and foreboding tone of the film is brought home by the haunting and sharp piano keys of the film’s theme that permeates the film and punches home that this is a film clearly aimed at a more adult audience.

Pattinson does a great job showing the deeply broken individual that is behind the mask and that Batman is the only form of escape or therapy that Bruce Wayne has due to his insistence on saving a city that many argue cannot be saved. He has strained his relationship at times with Alfred (Andy Serkis), caused damage to the financial stability and reputation of the family company in his quest for vengeance and justice, and has become a bitter and broken recluse in doing so. In many ways, it could be argued that his only socialization with others is as The Batman and his single-minded obsession is chilling to watch.

Pattinson also handles the action sequences well as the film spaces them out to put the emphasis more on the man than the gadgets as they are kept to a minimum even during a thrilling chase with the new version of The Batmobile.

The strong supporting cast works well with the film and Paul Dano gives a very compelling and disturbing version of his character which makes the film even darker and more engrossing.

Director Matt Reeves has crafted a dark and foreboding tone and visual style as a good portion of the film takes place in the darkness and his screenplay is not afraid to take chances by putting the emphasis on the characters and their flaws versus an abundance of action and effects.

I found this version of the character and interpretation more engrossing than prior versions of the film as the bold move to do a slow-burning and dark murder mystery versus an effect-laden action film reminded me of some of the better Batman stories such as Batman: The Killing Joke or Batman: The Long Halloween.

The film is not going to be for everyone, especially younger viewers and some may take issue with the casting choices, but their performances shine and as such, “The Batman” was a very engaging and unforgettable tale that for me serves as one of the best adaptations of the character ever.

""The Batman deserves all the hype it generated and then some. Matt Reeves delivers a distinctly darker, more intense, frighteningly realistic noir thriller than past adaptations, with an aggressively vengeful Bruce Wayne / Batman and a fear-inducing, mysterious, lunatic Riddler.

Greig Fraser's cinematography - bone-chilling ""ins-and-outs"" of Batman and stunning footage of Gotham - and Michael Giacchino's score - genuinely addictive, elevates the entire film - make this adaptation the best-looking and best-scored cinematic version of the Batman ever.

Even with the narrative focus on the detective work, the action sequences are exhilarating and beautifully shot. The entire cast is extraordinary, especially Paul Dano and Robert Pattinson - the latter destroys all skepticism around his talent.

Chris Sawin,5.0,"Paul Dano and Colin Farrell are extraordinary, but _The Batman_ is a three hour slog through Gotham that culminates with an over exaggerated riddle that isn’t worth solving. Having Batman and Jim Gordon both speak in raspy, whispery grunts feels excessive as does Gordon’s insistence on calling Batman, “Chief,” every time that they’re together. The film deserves credit for prominently shining the spotlight on the underbelly of crime in Gotham, but the storytelling in _The Batman_ is a lot like Bugs Bunny meaning to have taken that left turn at Albuquerque; a meandering foray down a dark rabbit hole that isn’t entirely necessary.

Ever since it was announced that Matt Reeves was going to direct The Batman after Ben Affleck stepped down for personal reasons, I had no doubt he was going to put on one hell of a masterpiece. This is the definitive live-action Batman. An epic 3-hour film noir that delves deep into comic lore of Gotham City.

Robert Pattinson perfectly embodies both Bruce Wayne and Batman. I love the character arc he goes through, realizing Gotham doesn't need vengeance to heal, but hope. Zoë Kravitz plays a phenomenal Selina Kyle, you actually feel her emotions throughout the movie. Another plus is that she actually feels integral to the plot (unlike The Dark Knight Rises). Paul Dano is a terrifyingly realistic interpretation of The Riddler, using the internet to gain a fan base for his sick games. Andy Serkis plays an excellent Alfred, being Bruce's emotional support during Dark times.

The soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is absolute God-Tier. Elevating every scene with emotion and sometimes dread. Finally a score to rival Danny Elfman's iconic score. Matt Reeves direction is impeccable as always, getting some nice shots while also making it feel nice and claustrophobic around Batman.

r96sk,9.0,"It's a cracker, no doubt about it!

Matt Reeves did a great job with 2022's <em>'The Batman'</em>. It's difficult not to compare this to other Batman films, though that's DC/Warner Bros. fault for featuring him so much in recent times. I'll get this out the way early: I'd say <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/batman-begins/"" rel=""nofollow"">Batman Begins</a>'</em>/'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/the-dark-knight/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Dark Knight</a>'</em> are superior, not by much, which is a similar case for the character performances too.

Robert Pattinson is a terrific Bruce Wayne, though Christian Bale still edges him out in my eyes. Zoë Kravitz is probably the best Catwoman I've seen, though the rest - from the Riddler to Penguin to Alfred - have been portrayed better; aside from Commissioner Gordon, with Jeffrey Wright being excellent. Paul Dano is the least enjoyable performer, for me, here, I found his showing to be a bit 'meh' - effective, but meh. Barry Keoghan makes a cameo, I won't say as who, but I don't hold high hopes for him in that role; though, <a href=""https://variety.com/2022/film/news/the-batman-ending-joker-barry-keoghan-matt-reeves-1235196812/#:~:text=While%20it%20may,more%20%E2%80%9CBatman%E2%80%9D%20movies."" rel=""nofollow"">apparently</a> it won't be anything that happens anyway. For the best!

Anyway... the above sounds <em>way</em> too negative - as I did thoroughly and absolutely enjoy this film, hence the very positive rating. The pacing is very good, the cinematography is brilliant (Gotham looks fantastically bleak!), the story is engrossing and the dialogue is on point. The scenes with Pattinson/Kravitz and Pattinson/Wright are my favourite moments. It's a film that I'd consider as 'outstanding'.

Tatsky,8.0,"I like how Batman is depicted with a naive and loser POV from his rich high tower, a rich trust fund baby called out by both sane (Catwoman) and insane (Riddler) people while he remains oblivious until the consequences are literally flooding the city. While he uses the idea of Batman as a mantle for him to process trauma, his obliviousness to his own celebrity status and image creates unintentional side effects from his parents' death hogging the spotlight away from the people that mattered to his own nebulous idea of ""vengeance"" being co-opted by the goons, a heel-turn realization that eventually changes the rack focus, ultimately leading to a wider perspective and a selfless act of cutting the cord and helping others. Hope is more important than his idea of justice, in the end, empathy being the missing piece throughout. Instead of being a voyeur like Riddler during his master plan (Riddler binoculars on the mayor, Batman binoculars on Catwoman), he switches to being on the ground to help, no longer from his high castle.

It's interesting how this arc plays out. At the beginning, it plays into this ""badass"" idea comic book fans love to gloat about Batman of striking fear into crime, but the way it's portrayed is frightening to everyone. It's a better criticism of Batman's fascism than BvS was going for, showcasing his fear to people who don't even deserve it, such as kids doing vandalism who probably believe the system is failing them, but to him at the beginning crime all looks the same.

Honestly this film goes harder than Phantasm on the tragedy that is Bruce Wayne. They're inseparable by choice, to the point that Bruce basically is Batman even when not in the costume, a social recluse who can barely function in real life, listening to emo music and having rings around his eyes, a night owl to the extreme. The struggle is there even as Batman, literally smashing his face on a truck.

There are some contradictions throughout thematically, however. It's weird how it goes between ""it's the WHOLE system, all cops are pigs"" to ""it's just bad apples"" simultaneously, displaying a somewhat cringe centrism. Catwoman by the end basically points it more to systemic (and Batman and Thomas Wayne's criticism of thinking they know better and actually makings things worse isn't undercut, which by itself is also institutional criticism), although it still feels like they could've done more. Maybe out of their hands by the studio or this as far as they could get away with vs. the producers (it almost felt like a struggle for Catwoman to outline her ""eat the rich"" mentality). Gotham itself is a mess of contradictions and it's OK to let the viewer lie between it all I guess.

Also the relationship between Catwoman and Batman is kinda slimy and male-centric. Catwoman, while great as a character, functionally falls to Batman's controlling force with a forced romance in the second act. Sure they're both suffering from trauma but Batman was literally using her despite it all, it at least understands the power gap more in the third act.

The end of the second act also spins its wheels a bit too much, the mystery pace kinda suffers a bit from focus and scenes get too drawn out (Riddler just disappears for a while). The movie could've been 20 minutes shorter. Doesn't stop it from having a terrific third act since most blockbusters have kinda sucked on that note
Although speaking of Riddler, master class. Probably my favorite villain in a Batman film. 

The aesthetic was gorgeous. I love its color grading and architecture, still thinking of the Wayne tower and its metal grates, goth hallways, and insane attention to detail that gets blurred out intentionally in the frame for most of the movie by Bruce's obliviousness to the world. It also keeps a balance of evoking the black/white movies while still being colorful, more of flooded black and oranges. I think of that sequence with Penguin not mainly for the fight itself (which to me was a bit messy) but moreso the flooded orange of the fire being the only color creating a sorta gradient on the black car, and how the flare at the end matches that aesthetic, that one color illuminating Batman leading everybody else to exit the frame, like a light in the darkness. Lovely

The music.... Giacchino just beat out his Incredibles score for me, masterful work with motifs, percussion, and rhythm. His mastery of percussion and horns during the lights out Batman hallway fight and how the horns blast, how well edited the percussion beat subtly goes through the Penguin chase and other fight sequences, Batman doesn't quite have a dance like Hong Kong films but the music makes it come close. The timpani and strings are so well used!!! Great use of Ave Maria both as soundtrack and score. Catwoman's motif? Amazing.

The performances are great all around. Finally a film with Turturro that I don't hate him. He's well restrained and perfectly cast, his dickish attitude now a strong point making him very memorable with very little screen time, much like Farrell in the same film. Kravitz made me the closest to tearing up with how she visually handles conflicting emotions, I still think about that scene with the voicemail where her eyes are all over the place and has trouble keeping it all together. Dano as Riddler is terrific.

Yep, this is my fav Batman film now.",2022-03-27T15:39:50.559Z,414906,4 stars,0.4448018968105316
aquiluus,10.0,"This film is so intricate, there's so many details, things you can obverse on multiple watches and not have noticed on your first. There's a lot of things that just aren't spoken that give this film so much substance. So many layers and nuanced story telling. Gotham City feels as it should, as it's own character and a visceral cesspool of corruption and just dirt. It feels dirty, unpolished... it's amazing.

There's so many shots in this film that are just simply breathtaking and intentionally dirty. It helps capture this visceral tone and fits substantially well with the universe of Batman.

Being a diehard fan of Batman for, like, pretty much all of my life- I have to say; Matt Reeves absolutely nailed it with a completely faithful adaptation of Batman. Not once in this movie did he do something I felt was completely out of character and Robert Pattinson solidified the performance of both Bruce Wayne and the Batman. I love Matt Reeves went to the extent to make sure this Batman doesn't kill, as other directors have seem to give less care to. Yes, even Nolan. It should have to go without saying that Batman does not kill, that's a no-brainer, but for decades this has been a problem in Batman films... and finally, it no longer is a problem. That's how you do it.

Bringing this review to a conclusion, this is easily my favourite Batman film. So many things about this film just feel like it's pulled straight out of a comic book. I mean, Riddler flooding the city itself is pulled straight from Zero Year and there's so many nods to comic moments and members of Batman's rouges gallery. Matt Reeves knew what he was doing, and he crafted this film for diehard Batman fans, succeeding immensely. Can't wait to see more of this universe.",2022-04-01T17:52:30.345Z,414906,5 stars,0.8000842332839966
Aqueronte72,6.0,"> Enormous mass that is per se a riddle. Forget screenplay, it's a comic storyboard; Do you remember Rorschach, from Moore's Watchmen, ruminating in the sewers?, ok, transpolate Batman and it works! No way, here I go-monologue and comic dialogues (effective and practical like instant soup, with 2 percent protein), comic narration, that is functional, utilitarian, Bentham would say, with the ellipses and any speech or reasoning that requires 2 minutes of reflection, at most!, """"this whole city´s gonna come apart"" says a District Attorney, scenic cuts and messy complexity...-entertaining but messy-comic, etc, ...it is a comic turned into a movie by someone who - I'm speculating, any resemblance to reality is purely by chance - was advised or made, or made comics in his life, don't you believe me? Ellipsis of all ellipses: ""Alfred, you're not my father ""At 23 minutes of tape, all the conflict of identity and belonging, as well as the purpose of the hero, under the sieve of the most selfish and mean son of millionaires, but let's forget this, let's continue. A Batman beating Kurt's velvety drum Cobain, -didn't tell the subversive c revolutionary adence of Cobain, to think like that I would have to know that grunge swept hardrock -finally in the 90s- and buried Motley Crue, Guns and Roses and others, (yes, I mentioned him, Cobain, and not Nirvana that did not exist, that's why when we die we are left without this specific type of grunge, I already digressed, anyway) but yes, this Batman is doubly omniscient, an ego the size of Gotham City authorizes him (a) not only to -his first omniscience- speaking in the first person of himself when running the plot, that is to say in the events, ""I am revenge"" he says to the subway gang members, (scene that is not better than Todd Phillips' Koker subway, for give another example) that this happened -the first person- almost in all the other versions that precede it,it is also included here -its omniscience, obviously- dominating forensic or medical terms: ""eschimia""? ask Batman of course!, but to (b), his second omniscience, being the narrator of his exploits in the first person, this again leads us to an Alan Moore influence but, with all due respect, as a clericot of Alan's genius Moore. When Batman wants to see the Penguin, he just has to be like the Penguin, appear in the doorway and announce himself, and please, for the fun of the plot, Batman almost spouts a sentence ""please tell me you won't let me in to unfold my money in the form of weapons hidden in my suit, and get in anyway. That is to say, the theatricality and the shadows of the bat, remained in the Babyboomer Generation or Generation X when the entrance was an ""appearance"" through shadows, suspicion and myth. The film is a complex mass because it is as if The Batman, The Batman 2 and 3 had been compressed and I am not only talking about the exhausting time of almost 3 hours, but also because of the number of common threads in which it was woven into a single feature film. For example, the plot increases its complexity first with a Riddler who is an anti-hero, because he indirectly helps Batman and the supposed common good and because of the premises that justify his murders, unmasking the big shots of the underworld at high levels of government, but later, arrested as Edward Nashton, he unmasks himself, that is, he turns himself in, sitting in that cafeteria just when, then yes, we will understand his ""fine"" intentions, and he becomes a true public order villain because he incites the revenge to the uncritical masses and followers of the disorder who have suffered or have resentments for any type of discrimination or corruption that they have suffered in Gotham city, (no more and no less than similar to the end of Todd Phillips' Joker);another complexity is with the cat The cat, I will not say Catwoman, who has her own drama for Kyle and at some point Batman leans on her, to spy on the Prosecutor and at least 2 times saves her from murdering her father Carmine Falcone and the his father's henchman. On the other hand, there is the added density or complexity of transcending and publishing the videos that show that the mother of Bruce Wayne, the mother of Batman had psychiatric problems in Arkham and hospitals and comes from a family that descendants who also had these difficulties and Thomas Wayne , trying to silence the journalist, he used the biggest thug Falcone. In other words, there is a possibility that Falcone, Catwoman's stepfather, is the one who murdered the Waynes that night because Batman's father was about to pity or denounce the next day that he only wanted to silence the journalist and NOT murder him as Falcone did. . In short, it is entertaining but poorly planned for a single feature film due to the enormous amount of detail that is handled.",2022-04-02T05:17:04.458Z,414906,2 stars,0.4317737817764282
CinemaSerf,6.0,"OK, shoot me now - but you can tell when you are watching a film at the cinema and the audience start to get a bit restless. Well mine did with this overlong, and frankly rather dreary film. The opening few, somewhat dystopian, scenes reminded me of ""Blade Runner"" (1982) and we do hit the ground running. Amidst an hotly contested mayoral election, a chap in a gas mask (""The Riddler"", we learn later) brutally takes out the sitting candidate enticing the ""Batman"" (Robert Pattinson) to come help his policeman pal ""Gordon"" (Jeffrey Wright) to investigate. Seems that the killer wanted that to happen because he leaves our caped crusader a card with a clue. Soon the great and the good of the city are dropping like flies and a web of corruption and deceit at the top echelons of government is emerging. Personally I found this all a bit dull. It flows terribly slowly, and after a while the relentless darkness and a really pretty soporific, moody, effort from Pattinson just started to bore me. There are loads of plot holes - not least just how the ""Riddler"" manages to pull off some pretty heavy duty crimes without having to scale any tall buildings, or sneak past the heavily guarded victims of his spree. The scenes with the completely unprotected DA (Peter Sarsgaard) in a dimly lit street are just plain daft. Colin Farrell is probably my highlight as the duplicitous ""Oz"", and Zoë Kravitz (""Cat Woman”) offers us some decent acrobatics but otherwise, this is an hugely over-rated affair that has a serious paucity of dialogue, is heavily scored and during it's almost three hours, not enough actually happens. Indeed, it is very reluctant to let us leave. I will admit that my first guess at the ending was a bit optimistic, but it could conclude at least another four times before we are finally allowed to stretch our legs. It might look better second time around, but for now it's nothing at all to write home about.",2022-04-04T16:42:24.863Z,414906,2 stars,0.546837329864502
JPV852,8.0,"Good albeit not great, this newest incarnation of Batman is well done if not also incredibly dark. I did like Robert Pattinson's portrayal and didn't employ the annoying voice that kind of ruined The Dark Knight and more so, The Dark Knight Rises.

Horseface,7.0,"I am so tired of superhero movies. Still, being down with a mild case of Corona, I wanted something to watch that'd go down easy, and The Batman was available, so I picked it.

I have to say that this, to me, is one of the rare superhero movies that appeal to me. And that's after having seen every other Batman movie since Tim Burton's 1989 one. And, I dare say, even with me being fed up with superhero movies, I think this is the best attempt.

At three hours, it feels like binge-watching a three-part miniseries. And by that I mean both that to the extent that it is three acts, they almost perfectly align with an hour each, and also that the pacing is great, and I never got bored.

The cast is excellent. Also, for the first time ever, I'm not thinking that it's ridiculous that no one recognizes Bruce Wayne as Batman. The half-mask actually makes Bruce Wayne unrecognizable. I'm not sure if they thought of that during casting, but it's really quite impressive.

It's also nice to not have to suffer through a pathetic attempt from Batman to make his voice sound cool. Oh dear, Christian Bale trying to look and sound cool was just so cringey. Robert Pattinson is by far the best Batman I've ever seen. The almost depressive mental torment he conveys does not come off as fake or pretension, and that's a first for the Batman franchise as far as I'm concerned.

The mood is bleak without being depressive, the score is fantastic, if a bit too much, the cinematography is amazing, I really have very little to fault here. If anything, it may come off as a little pretentious and self-indulgent, but that's also part of the attraction, and if I'm being completely honest, I think it's more to do with my own ""people need to grow up and stop watching these childish things"" prejudice I have, when in fact the 15-year-old inside of me f...ing loves it, and I need to embrace that childish part of me rather than hate on it.

If there's anything I would change about this movie, it's what I feel is somewhat of a PG-ification of Batman. I would love to see this movie with all its bleak desperation and lust for vengeance on the depravity and evil in the Gotham world, but with a seriously anti-hero, all-violent, bringer-of-death Batman. I would love to see him - in a more crude outfit, with less bells and whistles, and definitely without the cape - destroy, slay and kill, with exploration of the terrible aftermath it would bring, including the impact on his psyche, rather than the beat-up-and-let-go strategy that he is using in this movie. That part just feels to not align with both the doomish mood that sets the story and the seeming existential depression of our masked protagonist. I think that would warrant yet another installment in this franchise. I'm actually surprised how much meat there is on this character.

Also, if the movie overall is consistently a bit too much, the ending takes it one notch further on that scale.

Regardless, I now have two superhero movies that I keep in my movie collection. The other is Watchmen (Director's Cut).

1 star deducted for Catwoman being racist without it being presented as a problem. The casting of her is perfect, by the way. Much better than Michelle Pfeiffer.",2022-04-23T13:20:52.161Z,414906,4 stars,0.46385663747787476
Peter McGinn,8.0,"Oh boy, yet another review here on TMDB about this movie. What is it about comic books that garners so much interest? I am no longer a comic hero fan, either in movies or the source comic books. I have seen some of the Marvel series and the only one that I would watch multiple times if it came across my screen in Ant Man and the Wasp, with its wit, action and humor.

I did read superhero comics as a kid, however. I stuck to DC comics. I especially liked the Legion of Superheroes, though I also read the Justice League, Superman and Batman. This was the Silver Age of comics, I believe, before they restarted and complicated the field with reimagining the comic universe (or whatever it is they did).

Anyway, I was a DC boy so I gave The Batman a look see. It is a dark film, both in its themes and its camera work. No wit and humor to speak of here, just grim and introspective comic book noir. But it was intriguing and interesting enough to hold only my attention. There were a couple of interesting twists on traditional Batman villains, for example. As with a lot of current thrillers, there is quite a body count, when sometimes with violence, I think less can be more.

It is not a film I will watch multiple times or anxiously await a sequel for, but I do not regret the time spent watching it.",2022-04-27T09:39:42.003Z,414906,4 stars,0.35415515303611755
mahmus,10.0,"_The Batman_ is the best live-action Batman movie yet. It's the type of Batman film I've been waiting for my whole life.

It's dark and realistic, but also stylish and large-scale. It's not limited by a commitment to realism like the Dark Knight trilogy, nor is it burdened by a shared universe like the DCEU. It is its own thing. A moody, disturbing, visually stunning, David Fincher-inspired, three hour long detective epic with some of the best interpretations of the characters ever put on screen.

Robert Pattinson is fantastic as a younger, moodier, and yes, more emo Batman. Paul Dano is straight up terrifying as the Riddler. Colin Farrell is unrecognisable in more ways than one as The Penguin and Zoë Kravitz is easily my favorite live-action Catwoman. Massively underrated is john Turturro as Carmine Falcone.

This movie kept me hooked all the way through. It's almost three hours long but it feels like two.

This is the best Batman movie. The Dark Knight is good and all, but Reeves finds the perfect mix of gritty realism and style (Nolan would never even dare to have a snorricam shot of Batmam gliding over the city), and finally gives us a live-action Batman that lives up to the title of ""World's Greatest Detective"". Not that there's much competition, since he's like the only one to actually do any detective work (no, Christian Bale magically finding a fingerprint on a broken bullet doesn't count).",2022-04-29T18:34:07.252Z,414906,5 stars,0.5393508672714233

Per Gunnar Jonsson,4.0,"To be honest, this is a really good movie. Hang on? So why did I only give it 2 out of 5 stars? Well, this is really personal but, to me, it is not a good Batman movie. I really had problems writing this review because it is a very good movie. I just did not like it as a Batman movie.

The movie is really dark, gritty and noir. Not really a problem. It works for some movies. But it is also quite slow at the beginning and the first quarter of the movie was actually boring. Remember, this is a three hour movie so a quarter is more than half an hour of “boringness”.

The “boringess” was broken up by a pretty cool car chase. Some people seem to not really like the batmobile and I have to say that it was not very inspired but it was not all bad either. Unfortunately the movie turned rather boring for a while again after that.

The movie tries to bring out more of the detective part of Batman than the previous movies, which is fine, but there is just too much moping around with Batman / Bruce Wayne walking around oozing sadness all around him.

Actually, this brings us to my main gripe with this movie. The choice of actor for the Batman is just wrong for me. He is more like a sad puppy than the Batman. The script that makes him mope around, have emotional outbreaks and, occasionally, being downright stupid like just staring dumbfounded when explosives go off in his face does not really help of course.

To me the Selina Kyle character had more charisma than the Batman, especially when the Batman was in his Bruce Wayne alter ego.

And I really, really dislike that twist about Bruce’s parents. That was such a lazy Hollywood writer hack thing to do just to create (unwanted) drama.

Then we have the Riddler. Compared to the charismatic villains that we have come to expect he is just a sad little psychopath with a bunch of equally sad fanatical internet followers.

Now, all of this would have worked great if it had been a movie about some, unspecified, vigilante. The movie is really well done. The detective story, the action (especially towards the end) and the noir setting would have worked great. Even at its three hour bloated length it would have been great although cut down to two hours or a bit more would have been even better.

tmdb28039023,5.0,"The Batman is not a terribly bad movie, but it would be twice as good if it were half as long. How a film that likes to take shortcuts – especially with the Riddler’s ‘riddles’ – can still take almost three hours to get to where it’s going, I haven’t the foggiest (but then this is a rather strange enterprise that gives us Andy Serkis in the flesh and covers Colin Farrell in prosthetic makeup and a fat suit). Director/co-writer Matt Reeves very wisely avoids origin stories and takes for granted relationships, which have already been well established in a decades-long canon, between certain characters; on the other hand, he allows his movie to become bogged down at the halfway point in a deluge of backstory.

The obvious problem is that there is enough material here for at least two films, and Reeves attempts to cram it all into a single one. Why? We all know there are going to be sequels, so why not save some for the next chapter? Or better yet, why not leave some of it on the cutting room floor? There is absolutely no reason for the Penguin to be in this movie; he might as well be the Imperceptible Man (an actual Batman villain, mind you) for all that he’s given to do. Catwoman has been pretty much played out, and as far as the Riddler, I can’t believe I’m going to say this, but Jim Carrey did a much better job with the role than does Paul Dano – an otherwise fine actor that inexplicably chose to play the character as the bastard child of Heath Ledger’s Joker and Tom Hardy’s Bane. That leaves Carmine Falcone (John Turturro), who provides the most intriguing plot points; why not make him the main, or even – dare I say it – only villain?

Now, The Batman is long enough to try the patient of a saint, but at least it’s great to look at. Like the first Tim Burton Batman (as described by the unerring Roger Ebert), it “is a triumph of design over story, style over substance - a great-looking movie with a plot you can’t care much about.” Gotham City in particular is a winning combination of Burton’s faux noir texture and Christopher Nolan’s plausible architecture. The best scenes involve Batman (Robert Pattinson) and Jim Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) – and indeed Pattinson has an uncanny knack for playing off veteran character actors – as a sort of pre-Robin dynamic duo; their adventures are poignant because they appear to happen in the real world, or at least as real as a world can be wherein a grown man disguises himself as a giant bat (compare last year’s Zack Snyder's Justice League, with its unending CGI assault on the senses).",2022-08-27T04:00:14.031Z,414906,3 stars,0.5133400559425354
Dean,3.0,"This was the worst Batman I have ever seen. 

Firstly, Robert Pattinson was the worst choice for the Batman role. In Twilight he was alright, but in Batman he definitely failed. He was more like a sad, depressed goth kid with no emotions. He tried too much to fit the role, but in fact we got this depressive, dead and empty Batman. 

Secondly, there were other small things that sucked about this movie, for example, Cat Woman had a very simple and stupid mask. Even older movie versions had a better mask than here. Batman's batmobile also sucked. Looked like a downgraded version. He also rode just a simple bike and lastly, he couldn't even glide with his default Batman suit. Also, don't know why but James Gordon was played by a black actor, while in every movie and even in every game this character is white. Riddler character also seemed stupid, wearing stupid mask and acting stupid and wasn't intimidating at all, but laughable. So, in general cast and acting was disappointing in this movie.

Lastly, the movie itself... It was dull, boring and depressive. They tried to make it masterpiece with 3 hours long, but in reality movie became just plain boring and I almost fell asleep.

Also like little to no action really at all. Catwoman was garbage. The penguin looked like a human almost like 2 face. And last but not least the riddler looked like the guy from my bloody valentine. Not only did they completely butcher the film but but they butchered the characters as well. I don't understand why this movie has such good ratings. It was the most boring batman I've ever seen.

TheTenth,-1.0,"not worth the hype.
Main problem(s) is the choice of cast.
Pattinson is now an adult that improved his hysical condition. But he still needs 300% more muscle to look like Batman. And his face didn't change much from Twilight, his acting improved but he still looks like an emo art student.
Andy Serkis has a face and body of a hardened mercenary. Absolutely not gentle British Alfred.
Zoe Krawitz acts (well I'm not sure) as brat, taunting people, and not wanting help or advice, and her face expressions are extremely annoying, showing contempt on everyone.
Colin Farrell - I'm a regular fan, has so much makeup on his face that it could be Marlon Wayams or Leonardo Di Caprio under we wouldn't see the difference.
Then the movie is pretty, good colors and cinematography. But the movie is sooo boring, things advance too slowly and actual story elements that make the plot go on strike violently in this long nothing. And the director tries finesse in the story most people didn't understand. When Batman is on to of the building he is shivering - most people think it's because of fear of heights, but it's the light, as he's a hero of the night. When Batman is with The Riddler, everyone thinks Riddler knows Batman is Bruce Wayne, but it isn't at all what he says, maybe one sentence is confusing, but yeah the Director tried something too intelligent.
The music is ... I just don't remember anything about the music.

RalphRahal,5.0,"The Batman (2022) is a movie that had the potential to redefine the Dark Knight’s legacy on screen. With a talented cast, stunning cinematography, and a noir-inspired tone, it promised a grounded and gritty exploration of Gotham and its shadowy protector. However, while some aspects of the film shine, the final product feels like a collection of mismatched ideas that fail to form a cohesive whole.

The city of Gotham is one of the film’s standout elements. Its rain-soaked streets, oppressive atmosphere, and dark corners are brought to life with incredible attention to detail. The cinematography immerses you in the city’s decay and corruption, making Gotham itself feel like a character in the story. For all its flaws, this is one aspect of the film that deserves high praise.

Robert Pattinson as Batman: Pattinson delivers a nuanced portrayal of a young, confused, and emotionally stunted Bruce Wayne. His lowered head and introspective demeanor highlight a man still struggling to define his purpose. While this take on Batman may not fit the tone perfectly, it’s a commendable performance.

Colin Farrell as Penguin: Farrell is unrecognizable and magnetic in his role. His transformation and gritty, charismatic performance make Penguin one of the film’s most memorable characters.

Zoë Kravitz as Selina Kyle: Kravitz’s take on Selina is grounded and refreshing, offering a version of Catwoman that feels more real and relatable than previous portrayals.

Paul Dano as Riddler: While his performance as a Zodiac-style villain is chilling, the characterization feels like a missed opportunity to explore a more comic-faithful version of Riddler.

The lack of narrative structure is the film’s biggest flaw. The first act doesn’t establish a clear emotional or thematic hook, making the transitions between acts feel directionless. The build-up to Falcone’s arc, for instance, is wasted with an anti-climactic arrest and immediate death that undermines the tension. The script might be ""good"" on paper, but the execution leaves the audience feeling lost.

While the movie tries to balance a young and vulnerable Batman with an oppressive, noir-inspired tone, the two don’t mesh well. Instead of feeling like a mythic hero, Batman often comes across as a spoiled kid who hasn’t figured out his place in the world. This might work for an origin story, but it clashes with the film’s dark aesthetic, making it hard to buy into the character’s journey.

The film borrows heavily from The Dark Knight trilogy, with scenes like Batman using a grappling hook to catch a villain or the Riddler’s livestreams evoking Heath Ledger’s Joker. These moments lack originality and feel more like attempts to replicate previous successes rather than creating something new.

Michael Giacchino’s repetitive and heavy-handed score feels uninspired compared to Hans Zimmer’s dynamic and evolving musical themes. While the ominous notes fit certain scenes, their overuse dulls their impact and makes the soundtrack feel one-dimensional.

The romantic subplot between Batman and Catwoman feels forced and poorly timed, especially in moments of high tension. For example, Catwoman saving Batman from a ledge turns into a romantic exchange instead of focusing on the urgency of the situation, detracting from the stakes.

While The Batman has some brilliant elements—particularly its visuals and performances, it ultimately falls short as a cohesive film. Every piece seems designed to fit a specific theme, but when combined, they form a disjointed experience. The movie tries so hard to be dark, gritty, and meaningful that it sacrifices storytelling and emotional resonance.

It’s a visually stunning film with standout performances, but the lack of structure, originality, and tonal balance keeps it from reaching the heights of previous Batman adaptations.

The Batman is an action-packed Neo-Noir Mystery Crime Drama that FINALLY captures the essence and characterization of Batman and the Fictional City of Gotham PERFECTLY.

Batman in the movie is finally shown to be really fucking scary, with criminals and crooks running in genuine terror and Batman beating up every person that stands in his way of vengeance. It makes Batman finally realizing his true purpose at the end much more satisfying. From people going from fearing him to actually following him into the light as a new symbol of hope and justice.

Matt Reeves also does a fantastic job of handling this mystery in the movie. The riddles being solved alongside Gordon and Batman, bring some excitement that has never been seen in any other Batman movie. using action spectacles as a sporadic punctuation mark or an exciting exclamation point to each riddle being solved.

Also, each riddle not only builds to the eventual conclusion but also provides us with a mystery that enables Reeves’ to explore the dirt and corruption in Gotham City by running into the inner workings of Colin Farell’s Penguin and Turturro’s Carmine Falcone. Also, with the help of the great performances of the two leads Pattinson and Dano, Its story was also expansive and executed well enough to show how all these clues were connected to each other and was concluded well enough in the third act despite its awkward switch from gritty detective neo noir story to typical superhero 3rd act.

In Conclusion, Matt Reeves’ Batman not only gives us a perfect characterization of the Dark Knight but also a brilliant and refreshing Neo-Noir Detective Story, with Visuals so good, that it made every scene look like something that's straight out of a Batman comic.

- ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS -

- Robert Pattinson gives us one of the best Batman performances ever, embodying him as a true symbol of fear not just in his lines but also in how he moves and how he acts, all of which is perfectly summarized in his hauntingly beautiful demon-like introduction. Easily the most comic-accurate Batman to date.

- Michael Giacchino’s amazing score was scary and hauntingly beautiful. A Batman score that stands equal alongside Shirley Walker's work in BTAS and Christopher Drake’s in the Dark Knight Returns.

- Greig Fraser’s cinematography was fucking beautiful, handling darkness and light with meticulous care. This movie would not be as good as it is if it wasn't for that man.

- Choreography is done really well and I really like the vulnerability they give to the caped crusader as he is constantly hit, knocked out, and staggered. It also offers a very raw feel to the fights making them seem like a spontaneous unchoreographed brawl.

- I like that the movie focuses on a detective story. Throughout all the Batman live-action adaptations we have never really seen Batman do a lot of detective work but this movie finally gives us that and it's very refreshing to see.

- Batman being the point of view character was also great. It gives us a story that finally centers around the Bat himself, even showing us a proper motivational background showing his struggles to live up to his father's legacy. Batman also in 80% of the screen time (with most of it being in the suit) is also refreshing as in previous adaptations Batman only shows up sporadically and villains are often the main focus.

- Batmobile Car Chase scene was fucking phenomenal.

- Joker scene felt really forced and should've been taken out.",2025-07-15T13:53:32.825Z,414906,4 stars,0.47059953212738037
r96sk,9.0,"Whatta film!

<em>'The Outfit'</em> is excellent. Second time in roughly three weeks that I've had the pleasure of seeing a Mark Rylance flick on the big screen and again he delivers - such a reliable actor. The other release was <em>'The Phantom of the Open'</em>, which is very good but both the film and Rylance's performance is bettered here. A thoroughly enjoyable showing from him as Leonard Burling.

Things start off extremely strongly with a terrific opening scene with Rylance's Burling, so I was praying that it would keep that high level and I'm pleased to say that - in my opinion, of course - it absolutely did. There's a bit at the end that I was initially unsure about, though upon further thought I enjoyed it just as much as the rest.

One element of this 2022 production actually stays the same from start-to-finish, I won't say what but early on I thought it may limit proceedings but if anything it just adds to the overall vibe of it all. The support cast, meanwhile, are all faces I didn't know before now, though every one of them give good performances - standouts being Johnny Flynn and Nikki Amuka-Bird.",2022-04-13T23:31:20.898Z,799876,4 stars,0.6488951444625854
Peter McGinn,8.0,"I will give any production with Mark Ryland in it a try, ever since I first noticed him in Wolf Hall. I enjoyed this film, with its taut script, realistic dialogue and several plot twists, which I won’t even mention for fear of giving things away.

This movie manages to be a noir piece, even though it doesn’t venture out into the dark and moody streets of Chicago. It is a set piece, taking place in one man’s tailor shop. I wonder if a theatrical production on Broadway is inevitable?

There are plenty of bad guys to be found here, but with enough shading of humanity as to make us root for a few of them over the others. But the script doesn’t care who you root for — the plot is the plot and it will runs its headlong course and draw us along with it.

Despite the periodic outbursts of violence, this is more a drama than a thriller. It reminds me of what Hitchcock is supposed to have said. Suspense isn’t a bomb exploding but rather it is wondering if it will go off. Of course, in thrillers, if you have a bomb, it must explode at some point. This movie isn’t that predictable.

The Outfit isn’t just a drama; it is a character study, and Ryland’s character bears up well under the plot’s scrutiny.",2022-04-27T09:56:45.927Z,799876,4 stars,0.4653036594390869

Nathan,8.0,"The Outfit is an isolated who-done it set in the late 1950's as a group of mobsters desperately try to find the rat in their crime organization. The setting was superb and nostalgic, and the set is fixed to one room for the entire film, which really aided in the paranoia of the film.

This isolation led to the film primarily being carried by dialogue and exposition, which was superb here. The script and dialogue were complex and clever, and the performances worked great in conjunction with it. Mark Rylance stole the show, he was sweet and calm, but had suspiciousness to him that led the audience to believe he knew more than he was letting on. He outshined everyone in this film. Zoey Deutch was lackluster as she really didn't seem to play a character that was believable. Her delivery was very modern day. Johnny Flynn and Dylan O'Brien were fine, but Simon Russell Beale was a surprise. For the small time he was here, I really enjoyed his menacing presence and his chemistry with Rylance.

This film has multiple layers of mystery to it, and it was a joy to watch them unfold on the screen. However, I believe that there was too much towards the end. I was very satisfied with the twists and turns up to the end of the film, but then they just became absurd and over the top. I really did not connect with the final few twists and ultimately it hurts the enjoyment of the film in totality.

Havana Rose Liu contributes tremendously with a superb lead debut as the smart and courageous protagonist.

I had been very disappointed in the last couple additions to the TCM franchise, so I knew it was very likely that it would not be any different with this one. I watched the film the day it came out, and received exactly what I expected, I didn't like it. I liked it more than I expected, yes, but still not enough. The acting was lacking, the premise was stupid, and it killed off the beloved legacy character in the most insulting way possible. The only redeeming aspects of the movie are the nice-looking cinematography and the amazing gore. However, I am looking forward to seeing the next one, and I have no idea why. 3.5/5.",2022-06-19T01:55:11.981Z,632727,3 stars,0.9528117775917053
tmdb28039023,1.0,"The original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre actually predated the original Halloween by four years, but now it’s the former’s turn to follow in the footsteps of the latter, resulting in a case of the blind leading the blind. This new Texas Chainsaw Massacre takes its cues from the recent Halloween and Halloween Kills, going as far as dusting off the franchise’s original Final Girl – the character, that is; Marilyn Burns, the actress who played the first Sally Hardesty, died in 2014, and she certainly is in a better place now (i.e., not in this movie).

Generally speaking, though, the only thing that separates this from pretty much every slasher film ever made is that, instead of the usual Dead Teenager Movie, Massacre ‘22 may very well be the first-ever Dead Millennial Movie. Speaking of which the kills, which have the power to save even the most generic and derivative of horror sequels, are another disappointment; only the first one, involving a very creative use of the bone shard sticking out of a compound fracture, shows any ingenuity.

The best thing that can be said of this uninspired effort is that it’s short (shorter still considering that about 10 of its 81 minutes are devoted to the closing credits); then again, any movie is bound to be brief that lacks a proper conclusion – and I’m not referring to the fact that when Sally, who has been hunting Leatherface down “for more than 30, 40 years”, finally has him cornered, she apparently decides, all of a sudden, that after having waited multiple decades for this moment, she might as well wait a bit longer; after all, what’s another five more minutes between old friends? This is excruciatingly stupid, but if the movie ended there it wouldn't be any more unsatisfying than the actual ending.

And the worst that can be said of TCM ‘22 is that it has the gall to draw a parallel between the titular chainsaw massacre and a high school shooting (“Stonebrook High”, which sounds very uncomfortably like Stoneman Douglas High School), as if a dumb movie that deals in gratuitous violence and doesn’t even have the decency to provide a cathartic resolution could ever find a way to connect emotionally to the victims of a real-life massacre. This is low, even by exploitation cinema’s sub-standards.",2022-08-28T05:48:01.826Z,632727,2 stars,0.34526342153549194

tmdb76622195,3.0,"The reluctant ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" franchise gets yet another reboot/reimagining/sequel, but this time they go the Halloween/Kills/Ends route and bring back a surviving character from the original film.  Things don't work out as well here as they did for the ""Halloween"" series.

Four idealistic, or naive?, friends purchase a ghost town in Texas.  They plan on renovating the entire town, and turning it into a progressive haven where they can save the world.  Sisters Melody (Sarah Yarkin) and Lila (Elsie Fisher), and couple Dante (Jacob Latimore) and Ruth (Nell Hudson) have run-ins with local law enforcement and some town hangers-on, with the film makers casting aspersions immediately- the Gen Z/millenials are portrayed as wide-eyed and woke, while the Texans encountered are a bunch of drawling, gun-toting racists.  Lila was injured in a school shooting, and Melody hovers over her constantly.  The group hear the tale of Leatherface from the 1974 original film, and we learn that the final surviving girl from that film, Sally (Olwen Fouere, taking the role originated by the late Marilyn Burns), became a Texas Ranger and is currently waiting for the call that her archnemesis may still be found since the murders of her friends are officially listed as ""unsolved.""  The group arrives in the ghost town to wait for a busload of investors, and find that an old lady (Alice Krige) and her adopted son (Mark Burnham) are still living in an abandoned orphanage.  The ghost town is going to get renovated by one man, Richter (Moe Dunford), who doesn't take to the group.  Leatherface finally makes a questionable appearance, there's a lot of questions throughout, and the carnage begins.

The timeline for the TCM franchise is even more convoluted than the Halloween franchise.  The film is barely over eighty minutes long, so there isn't a lot of character development or legacy building, although I did see director Garcia paying tribute to some other famous slasher films here and there.  The script tries to inject something different into its story, addressing the influencer craze without going overboard with it.  Garcia's direction works with well with the film's editing, and this is a tightly shot flick, although Bulgaria makes a lousy substitute for the Lone Star state- I'm a fourth generation born Texan, and know my birth state pretty well.

The problem here is, of course, the script.  Characters not only make bad decisions, they make idiotic decisions that literally get themselves and others killed.  While some of them evolve and put up a fight against Leatherface, they also open themselves up to their own demise because if they didn't, the movie would be even shorter.  The gore and violence is over the top, and I was very surprised that it got an (R) rating.  The special effects are very well done, but also very convincing, to the point that this isn't a ""fun"" horror film.  ""Terrifier"" was also a gory slasher/horror film, but it had tension and suspense.  ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" has little tension, and viewers asking aloud ""why did they just do that?!"" instead.  One set-piece on a bus was probably set up as the be-all end-all of gruesome mass murder, but it becomes a nihilistic exercise in tedium.  In this day and age, it's sad that we've become so numb, this is considered entertainment to be ""enjoyed"" again and again, considering that the original film, aside from one of the greatest titles of all-time, wasn't as gory as you would expect.

I think it's okay to finally put this franchise to rest, it debuted on streaming because of some disastrous pre-release screenings so don't look for it on physical media anytime soon.  I didn't hate it as much as some viewers and critics did; I guess I'm old school, looking for the horror in my horror films.",2023-07-15T11:32:33.543Z,632727,3 stars,0.5429551601409912

Filipe Manuel Neto,5.0,"**A very well-made film, in which the biggest flaw is trying to make a teenage love eternal.**

What happens after we die is one of the mysteries that has preoccupied the human race forever and remains unsolved. Of course, this will continue because Man's incessant search for more knowledge is doomed to hit insurmountable limits, barriers that we cannot penetrate. That is, despite his will, Man is not supposed to know everything. However, faith has proposed a lot of answers to the question of death, and there is not, I think, a single religion that does not defend the existence of life after the moment when the heart stops beating. What changes is what each religion and belief system proposes for that existence, and the way it seeks to advocate that proposal.

We don't know what religion believed Tessa and Skylar, the two main characters in the film, which never touches on issues of faith or religion at any time. We only know about the teenage love story they live, during a very short period of time that ends suddenly, when they have an accident, he dies, and she is injured. Times later, she begins to notice strange things, which lead her to believe that her late boyfriend is trying to communicate with her. The script is good, the story is nice, we quickly see a strong influence of the movie “Ghost” in this cinematographic work, and much of the story takes place in flashback, but it is relatively easy for us to understand when they start and when they end.

However, and despite the qualities, we have to recognize that the film does not bring anything new and that there are many overly sugary moments, in which the romance is served with excessive doses of sweetness and fussiness, normal for a teenage couple, but deeply irritating for the mentality of more adult and mature people. Let's face it, it was a summer dating! It was almost certainly not the great love of Tessa's life. I don't know that many couples who met each other in their teens and stayed together for all (or almost all) of their lives. It just doesn't happen on a regular basis, and it's difficult for us, however painful and traumatic the situation for the young girl may be, for her loss to be comparable to a mother who loses a child, or a child who loses her mother or something. And the supernatural and the existence of spirits or “ghosts” does not make sense to all people, even when their faith beliefs admit their existence.

The protagonists are Kyle Allen and Joey King, two very young actors who still have a long way to go if they want to keep their careers active in the world of cinema and television. I can't say they didn't do well… in fact, considering their youth, they both seem to have done a very satisfying job, especially King, who has more screen time, better material and more experience as an actress. The chemistry between the two is also good, it works quite well and lends some credibility to their romance. There is, however, something missing, a spark of intensity and maturity.

Technically, the film consistently relies on CGI and digital and computer-made special effects. It's something increasingly common, and dealing with a movie with a supernatural theme, it was difficult to escape it and avoid spending a good sum of money on good effects. I liked them, in general, especially the effect of the TV static, the mirror that breaks and the slow motion that follows (which reminded me of “Matrix” with their bullets). The bluish cloud that follows the car and that starts to drive it, after a certain moment, seemed to me cliché and exaggerated. The film makes use of a fairly regular cinematography, but well executed, with good colors and good lighting, and the editing was well done, giving the film a very safe and pleasant rhythm. The locations used for filming, the sets and the costumes are predictable, and the soundtrack is not memorable.",2022-09-03T01:42:32.687Z,818750,4 stars,0.4900992214679718
tmdb28039023,1.0,"The takeaway from Against the Ice is that not all CGI is bad — which doesn’t necessarily mean that some of it is good, only that some examples are comparatively worse than others. There is a scene in this movie that will remind you of The Revenant, except that the bear in Alejandro González Iñárritu’s film is one of its most memorable aspects; as for the one in Against the Ice, let’s just say that I’ve seen more realistic polar bears in those Coca-Cola Christmas ads. 

Now, both scenes involve lots of computer generated imagery and a stuntman pretending to be a carnivorous mammal of the Ursidae family, so the difference between awesome and pathetic lies in the performance of the actor being attacked.

Like in pro wrestling, the encounter between Leo DiCaprio and the bear may not have been spontaneous, and its outcome may have been predetermined, but that doesn’t mean the actor didn’t take an actual beating, getting thrown around to and fro like a ragdoll by way of wires; moreover, all of his facial and body language is committed to selling the gravity of the situation, which in turn makes the bear, CGI or not, look like a million bucks. Meanwhile in Against the Ice, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau pretty much just lies there, bringing no urgency to what should be a life-and-death struggle.

This scene is symptomatic of Against the Ice, which is no less a collection of clichés than The Revenant, but whereas the latter amounts to much more than the sum of its parts thanks to superb execution, the former is too conventional to ever transcend its chosen genre. 

Consider the way it tracks the passage of time beginning with “Day 1”, which is of course a logical starting point, but also a very obvious one; from there it skips all the way to “Day 26” — my question is, since apparently nothing of note happened in the first 25 days, why not just start with the 26th day and go from there? 

All things considered, no one will be surprised to learn that Ejnar Mikkelsen (Coster-Waldau) — on whose book (or, presumably, a translation of the same, seeing as how the Danish characters all speak English as a first language) the movie is based — and Iver Iverson (Joe Cole) “remained friends for life”, but don’t they always? Just like Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush in the King’s Speech, or Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali in Green Book. 

All movies “based on a true story” take extreme liberties with their source material, and I usually hate it when they do, but Against the Ice would have been considerably less trite if the makers had gone the opposite route with the characters’ relationship; after all, in the words of Mr. Burns following a similar but by no means as protracted ordeal, “once you've been through something like that with a person, you never want to see that person again.”",2022-09-08T21:31:36.116Z,836009,3 stars,0.4320923984050751

""KIMI contains the narrative potential and impactful cinematography that movies by Steven Soderbergh (No Sudden Move) always have, but not even a superb performance from Zoë Kravitz (The Batman) can hide some issues with the developed themes.

Technologically, the proximity of this world to ours is frighteningly realistic, but the attempts to tackle agoraphobia and invasion of privacy aren't all successful. The protagonist's arc focuses on her ability to overcome past trauma, something that is mostly well-done.

However, the abrupt conclusion of the whole story not only lessens and simplifies PTSD but raises numerous plot-related logical questions, in addition to a moral one concerning stalking.

It will likely create some division within the general audience.""

It’s three in the morning, but I’m gonna try and put down some coherent thoughts. 
This is exactly what I expected from a Soderberg thriller, and I mean that in the best way possible. I love his work and this is no exception. 

The technical filmmaking elements here are great: camerawork, editing, and its general sense of scene-to-scene rhythm. Feels methodical and elegant while still being fun and watchable. There are quite a few sequences that will stick with me for a while. Like how personal the stakes are in this and how well Zoë Kravitz handles her role. Reminded me a lot of Aneesh Chaganty’s Run in the way it frames and establishes its story. 
The biggest problems for me: It loses some of its rhythm around the middle and doesn’t feel as fleshed out as it could have been. Given how much I love David Koepp’s other works, I was a bit sad to see a lot of my qualms falling to the story writing/structuring. Few problems aside, I had a great time!

garethmb,-1.0,"After numerous attempts which saw talent attached only to depart before filming began, “Uncharted” has finally arrived on the big screen.

The movie is based on the hit Playstation series of games by Naughty Dog and stars Tom Holland as Nathan Drake, a young man who is as adept at history as he is with pickpocketing which he uses to offset his income from Bartending.

Nathan’s brother fled the law years earlier and aside from Postcards has had no contact with him over the years.  Things change when Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) arrives and recruits Nathan by showing him that he used to work with his brother. Despite misgivings and unresolved feelings; Nathan joins with Victor and finds himself in a daring caper to steal a valuable object that could unlock the key to a gold supply that has been lost for over five hundred years.

Naturally, there are others who want the money, and Nathan, Victory, and their dubious partner Chloe (Sophia Ali); as they rush around the world in one adventure after another to solve the ancient puzzles and stay one step ahead of some very deadly individuals.

The movie has elements of “National Treasure” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark” in terms of the quests to find ancient treasures mixed with action but keeps things in a simpler context. The focus is not on plot development, character development, or plausibility but considering the film is based on a video game, it does a good job with the source material.

There has been some controversy about the casting of Holland as Nathan is older in the game series, but he goes all-in with his performance even when the acrobatic action sequences does offer many reminders of his Spider-man role.

The action in the game is fun and over-the-top and more than once I thought I should be pushing my X and Square button to help him make the moves necessary to complete the task and survive.

The post-credit scenes offer some great possibilities for future adventures and those would be more than welcome for those looking for some no-brainer escapist entertainment.

""Uncharted is an action-adventure flick, but despite a more entertaining last act, it fails to break the curse of videogame film adaptations due precisely to the lack of said action and adventure.

Even though Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg offer good performances, as well as convincing arcs by the two protagonists, Ruben Fleischer delivers an extremely generic and formulaic narrative based on endless exposition. Additionally, the secondary characters become irrelevant due to the irritatingly repetitive betrayals and constant shifts of the true antagonist.

In the end, the general feeling is that it would be much more interesting to be controlling the characters than simply watching them. It may be enough for fans of the franchise, but for the average moviegoer, it's ""just one more"".""

DallasBob,5.0,"I'm just an ordinary joe.  I've never played the game this movie is adapted from but from what I hear it's pretty fun.  The movie itself is okay for a treasure hunting movie.  The action is good and keeps flowing, and the actors, Holland (latest Spiderman) and Whalberg seem to have good chemistry.  Even the female protagonist did well in her ""diverse & inclusive"" part.  

If I had any cons to put forth about the movie, I'd say the lead villian being a female (thanks to Woke-Hollywood's influence) has been thoroughly worn to the point of irritation.  This woke trope is tired and worse, but oh-so-true to the core, it is dubious at best; especially so when it comes to fight scenes between the protagonist and villain.  It is time for Hollywood to hang up its Woke-cape.  There is no need for ""inclusivity"" when you can just give someone the job because it works for the story instead of politics.  I wouldn't complain on this aspect so much if Liberal (woke) Hollywood had the ability to write good characters and therefore good scripts.  But that is not possible when you are reaching to tick off checkboxes.

**Somewhat Spoiler & complaints:** If the movie had simply begun with a female villain and had her demostrate certain abilities in combat, then her fighting men would be more believable.  It also would establish WHY her people would follow her.  But the female antagonist's action scenes do not come across as pertinent as they should because her profession is not established in the movie.  I struggled to get a handle on whether she was a fellow treasure hunter since she knew Walberg's character personally and was there to advise the rich villain, or if she was a hired mecenary.  Turns out she was the later, but that still did not help  her character gel.  I kept thinking, ""Why on earth would anyone follow her?  She's hasn't done anything to prove she's more than any other run-of-the-mill killer.""  If the movie failed in any way it was this one glaring aspect.  Henry Cavill made an EXCELLENT head henchman in _Mission Impossible: Fallout_, because men fighting men is believable; villains have menace.  But without that special training I mentioned for a female villian, any interaction between her and men in fight scenes comes across as purely contrived.  The actress, Tati Gabrielle, did very well as a villain but this women fighting men is just not believable; and that matters to the male viewing audience.  Instead of sitting on the edge of your chair wondering who's going to win, you're sitting back with a finger to your temple wondering what bullcrap Hollywood is going to make of this fight scene.  

If I have to rate this movie on a whole I give it 3.5/5 stars.  It's far removed from _National Treasure_ or _Indiana Jones_, but it's better than _Red Notice_, if only just.",2022-04-30T21:58:34.791Z,335787,3 stars,0.5987337231636047

Per Gunnar Jonsson,7.0,"This movie was pretty much what I expected or rather hoped for. It was a fun adventure/action rollercoaster plain and simple. This is one of those, rare nowadays, movies that are meant to entertain plain and simple. Two hours of adventure, action and twists barely held together by a rudimentary story and no woke rubbish or bullshit preaching. The latter is probably what rendered it a 40% rotten “critics” score on woke tomatoes while the audience gave it a 90% fresh score. As almost always a rotten score on woke tomatoes is an indication that it is a movie worthwhile watching.

The story, as can be seen from the movie blurb, is a treasure hunt a la Indiana Jones. It starts off by introducing the main character, Nathan, in a few brief scenes where Nathan bungles up a heist being perpetrated by his brother after which they are involuntarily separated.

Quick forward to present time and the main story takes off with Nathan being persuaded by Sullivan to embark on a hunt for an immeasurable treasure. Not exactly the newest or freshest of stories but if it works don’t fix it.

Pretty much everyone in this movie is a self-centered scoundrel with little to no care for anyone except themselves. Thus the action and treasure hunting is regularly interrupted by twists and betrayals. No one will claim that this movie has an elaborate and intelligent story. It does not have to. It is just meant to hold the action together.

I quite liked the main actors. Sullivan did a good job of being the blasé, self-centered scoundrel, Nathan of being the somewhat naive wannabe treasure hunter and Braddock was quite cool, and sexy (hey, I’m a guy), as the baddie. Antonio Banderas was Antonio Banderas although I was saddened by his premature exit from the hunt.

Overall the action was nice although the scenes in, and out of, the airplane was the usual unrealistic Hollywood action. Although that was overshadowed with the ship carrying helicopter scenes towards the end which was taking unrealism to new levels. But I didn’t really care because it was fun silliness. The moment they started to carry those ships away I started to hope that the writer would go for the silly and obvious stunt involving black powder. Yes unrealistic but there is no denying the coolness factor.

As far as I am concerned this was two hours well spent. The ending scene clearly suggested that the producers hoped to make a sequel. I would definitely watch it but with all the people lamenting the fact that someone dared to make a movie simply for entertainment without a profound (and boring) story or bullshit preaching in it that might not happen. It did make about four times its budget at the box office though so maybe.",2022-09-10T07:33:30.672Z,335787,4 stars,0.477774441242218

Nathan,7.0,"_Uncharted_ was perfectly predictable. I had a general idea of what to expect going into the film and got most of everything I wanted. While it is not groundbreaking cinema, it does offer so very great action set pieces that are pulled straight from the games I grew up loving. The story is very reminiscent of an adventure Nathan Drake would take during the games and the environments were diverse and engaging. My one big critique is the performances. While they were fine, I did not really think the casting was done in terms of the characters themselves but more for the star power. Tom Holland plays a character that is an edgier Peter Parker, he still has the charisma of Nathan Drake but there is something about him that still feels naïve and less sure of himself. I understand this is early in Nathan Drake's career, but it still felt to overly Spider-Man for me. There is really not much to say for Mark Wahlberg either, he plays pretty much the same character as every one of his other films. Sophia Ali, Tati Gabrielle, and Antonio Banderas all do a fine enough job in their roles but never do anything that make their performances stand out. Overall, this movie is fun if you sit back, relax and enjoy some great action and exploration. It is not great, but it definitely passes the time and is good time.

The Movie Mob,5.0,"**Uncharted overdid the action, cheesy performances, and selfish betrayals while leaving the story behind.**

Uncharted mixes National Treasure, Tomb Raider, and The Other Guys into a disappointing cocktail that leaves a bland taste. Several sequences and setpieces were lifted directly from the games, which is a fabulous treat for fans of the series, but that is about where the similarities end. Although a fantastic actor, Holland was a younger choice than many expected for the role, making Uncharted Nathan Drake's origin story. Unfortunately, this was less origin and more Mary Sue, as Drake already had all the knowledge and skills to navigate this outrageous movie. The CGI was obvious, and the stunts and action were so unbelievable for a character that started the movie as a bartender that it made it difficult to enjoy. All the characters were so unlikeable and duplicitous, with almost every interaction ending in another ""surprising"" betrayal. Mark Wahlberg's performance didn't fit in the movie either. He felt like he was just playing himself with goofy quips and fast-talking rather than trying to play a character in this universe. I was hoping for so much more, but this franchise-launching film was dead on arrival.",2023-01-14T07:06:58.056Z,335787,2 stars,0.6368602514266968

""Marry Me is far from being a groundbreaking rom-com, but the lead actors, compelling character work, and excellent original music make for genuine entertainment.

Jennifer Lopez (Hustlers) and Owen Wilson (Loki) surprisingly share amazing chemistry, in addition to delivering absolutely fantastic performances, constantly pulling viewers back to the screen when the narrative becomes repetitive and generic. John Bradley (Game of Thrones) and Sarah Silverman (Ralph Breaks the Internet) also contribute to the light and fun environment of the film.

The balance between the life of a celebrity and the ""common citizen"" is quite well explored, and the vision of how much fame limits a normal life is the most interesting storyline of the entire narrative.

For fans of the genre, it's strongly recommended.""

tmdb28039023,1.0,"Owen Wilson better be careful lest he becomes the go-to for aging Latino MILFs. Last year he managed to save Bliss from Salma Hayek’s strident overacting, but he has no such luck with Jennifer Lopez in Marry Me. 

Now, to be fair, the movie’s failure is not her fault, and she acquits herself a lot better than Hayek did; it also helps that Lopez is essentially playing herself – a mega popstar with a string of failed marriages. And whereas she isn’t an acting prodigy, nor is, for that matter, Maluma, who plays her temporary fiancee, they are nevertheless performers who know their way around a stage and are extremely comfortable in front of an audience.

It’s no surprise then that the only genuine moments in Marry Me take place during a sold-out show – that is, of course, until Kat Valdez (Lopez), having discovered, right before they are supposed to tie the knot in between musical numbers that Bastian (Maluma) has been unfaithful, has what can only be termed as a psychotic break and decides to pick out a random dude from the audience and marry him on the spot instead. Let’s put it like this: this plot is too outlandish even for Wilson, and he has been in several Wes Anderson films.

The reason that Charlie (Wilson) is at the concert is pretty random itself; Parker (Sarah Silverman), her friend and colleague – they are both teachers, or at least he is a math teacher that, as it often occurs in the movies, has only a handful of students in his charge; she on the other hand mostly appears to just hang around the school –, planned to attend the show with her girlfriend, but her girlfriend broke up with her, so she asks Charlie to come and bring her daughter along. 

Ok, so this is the hottest show in town – sold out, as I mentioned above –, but Parker just happens to conveniently have a third ticket available; still harder to believe is that her girlfriend didn't wait until after the concert to break up with her.

Anyway, that very same night Kat is already the butt of Jimmy Fallon’s jokes on The Tonight Show – which is obviously impossible because The Tonight Show doesn’t air live; in fact, it is taped in the afternoon and broadcast hours later. 

But who knows? Maybe Jimmy is clairvoyant and, having seen the whole thing coming, pre-taped a few pertinent jokes. All things considered, you know you’re in big trouble when your movie makes less overall sense than Notting Hill.",2022-08-28T06:29:39.022Z,615904,3 stars,0.48072490096092224

Marry Me doesn't do anything new, but Jennifer Lopez's class and Owen Wilson's lovable everyman charm make an average rom-com a decent watch. The outlandish concept of a pop star spontaneously marrying a random fan in the crowd, feeding the media circus, and then accidentally falling in love might seem far-fetched, but in today's world not completely impossible. Marry Me tries to tell the story Notting Hill for a new audience but falls short by rushing the story and forgetting to make the romance believable. It all just happens without convincing or satisfying its audience.

She had gone to the toilet leaving him holding the card, ""Kat"" sees it and says yes to the proposal he didn't actually make! What now ensues revolves around the two of them getting to know each other amidst a media frenzy the likes of which the world has never seen - before an ending that can easily be seen from space. Wilson is terrible, no other word for it; but J-Lo is a class act. She plays her part for all it is worth on stage but also comes across as quite a decent human being as she tries to acclimatise to his rather more pedestrian existence. Maluma is very easy on the eye, but contributes precious little and the title song - written by eight people, apparently - is awful!

garethmb,-1.0,"Originally set to release in December of 2019; the long-delayed cinematic retelling of Agatha Christie’s “Death on the Nile” has finally arrived in cinemas. The last cinematic version of the classic book arrived in 1978 and this time; Director and star Kenneth Branagh beings his version of Master Detective Hercule Poirot to Egypt after a chance encounter with his friend Bouc (Tom Bateman) while on vacation; Poirot attends the wedding of wealthy socialite Linette Ridgeway (Gal Gadot) and notices that she has married a man named Simon Doyle (Armie Hammer).

The wedding is a bit of a shock to many as just six weeks prior Doyle was engaged to Jacqueline de Bellefort (Emma Mackey), and Poirot observed the two of them in a London club and how Ridgeway was introduced to Simon by her friend Jacqueline.

The wedding reception is disrupted by the arrival of Jacqueline and Linette and Simon confides in Poirot that she has been following them around the world and asks the Detective to encourage her to leave them alone so they can get on with their life.

Jacqueline is highly disturbed and pleads her love for Simon and shows a gun which leads Poirot to encourage the newlyweds to abandon their overseas plans and go home. Simon and Linette press on and decide to take their wedding party on a cruise of the Nile in an attempt to get away from Jacqueline.

The plan seems to be working well until Jacqueline shows up as a ticketed passenger at a stop along the way. When a near-fatal accident occurs followed by a murder; Poirot must investigate the guests to find the killer. Naturally, there is plenty of motivation to go around, and as the deaths mount; Poirot must use his genius to find the killer.

The movie takes its time getting started but the CGI-enhanced scenery and the strong cast are very compelling and set the pieces in place very well. While I was able to solve the mystery about halfway into the film, some of the details around it were cleverly concealed and there were plenty of twists that had me consider other possible suspects.

Some may find the film a bit slow but that is the nature of a good mystery as time is given to developing the characters and their motives which adds to the suspense of the film.

In the end, the film is an engaging mystery that recalls the classic movie mysteries of old and it will be very interesting to see if audiences will embrace the film in the same way as they did with “Murder on the Orient Express” and audiences will get more Poirot adventures from Branagh in the near future.

""Death on the Nile retains the problems of its predecessor, containing an even less mysterious central mystery and even less interesting multiple storylines. Kenneth Branagh is the great savior, offering a distinctive directing style and an iconic performance as Hercule Poirot.

Despite some good displays and a couple of pleasant arcs, Michael Green's screenplay relies too much on its heavy exposition, not managing to escape the forced, dull, redundant dialogues. The audiovisual environment surrounding the entire film reeks of digital deception, sweating its green screen throughout the runtime.

A whodunnit is worth more than merely finding the criminal, but the resolution literally being the first option that the first act suggests leaves an inevitable taste of disappointment.""

CinemaSerf,6.0,"It's probably best to start by saying that this adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel has virtually nothing at all in common with the 1978 Ustinov/Niven iteration (which I really like). Sir Kenneth Branagh starts off by giving us a little of the somewhat tragic WWI backstory to the famous Belgian detective before we are introduced to the newlywed ""Doyle"" couple Gal Gadot and Armie Hammer, his disgruntled ex girlfriend ""Jackie"" (Emma Mackey - whom I could have sworn was Margot Robbie) and an assembled cast aboard the luxury Nile paddle steamer ""Karnak"" where murder and mayhem ensue. A great deal of care has been taken with this production, and it looks great. That said, though, I found the characterisations pretty sterile; there are stars here but not (Annette Bening notwithstanding) big stars, and we get to know little of the personalities or grudges of the suspects. Tom Bateman reprises his role as ""Book"" from Sir Kenneth's other, equally flawed, ""Poirot"" outing back in 2017, but that stretches coincidence just a bit too much! There is little, if any humour, and though I did initially enjoy the 1930s Blues music it started to intrude a bit as the film progressed. Patrick Doyle's rather bland score reminded me of ""Kingdom of Heaven"" (2005) and though there is a fair degree of location photography, there is an equally fair degree of pretty obvious CGI too. Somehow, Sir Kenneth just isn't ""Poirot"" for me. His performances are always just a little bit too theatrical - he always has to be centre stage. The whole pace of the film really does lack any accumulating sense of menace and though it is certainly better seeing it on a big screen, I was really somewhat underwhelmed.",2022-03-28T18:40:28.765Z,505026,3 stars,0.5414103865623474

Per Gunnar Jonsson,4.0,"I honestly did not expect much out of this movie given how Branagh’s Murder on the Orient Express turned out.

Now, Hercule Poirot together with Sherlock Holmes are my two favourite fictional detectives and I’m obviously having strong opinions about the subject. If you liked the movie then fine but this is my personal opinions so… here we go.

Just as with Murder on the Orient Express it could have been a decent mystery/crime movie if it had not pretended to be a Hercule Poirot movie but again this was a miserable attempt to make a Americanized version of Hercule Poirot.

The movie starts off with black and white scenes from World War I trying to make him out to be some war hero. There was no reason for that and it is not Hercule Poirot.

One good thing I can write about the movie is that there are some lovely scenery, especially at the beginning. Unfortunately that is about it as far as the good parts go from my point of view.

Apart from the good scenery the film goes overboard trying to get fancy with the camera. Like the ridiculous revolving scenes on the boat, bizarre perspectives and quite a few too dark and gloomy scenes.

The worst part of the movie is that it is totally disrespectful of the Hercule Poirot that Agatha Christie created. Poirot does NOT run after criminals while shots are being fired, Poirot may scream but with dignity, not soap opera like outbursts. He was not the only one having unbecoming outbursts by the way. And do not get me started about how the movie ruined the famous end scene where Poirot traditionally exposes the criminal by having Poirot waving a gun and appearing totally dishevelled. Even the hideously large moustache is just all wrong.

Death on the Nile waits almost an hour into the movie before there is an actual death... a murder mystery that is focused much more on the shallow lives of its wealthy aristocrats rather than solving the murder mystery. The mystery is fairly stereotypical and easy to figure out. The film is dreadfully slow, making the 2 hour run time feel more like 3 hours. If you enjoyed Murder on the Orient Express, you would probably enjoy the expanded characterization of Kenneth Branagh's Hercule Poirot amidst the spectacular set pieces and wardrobe of the 1930s. Mix in superstar Gal Gadot and some other up-and-coming talented actors and Death on the Nile rises from absolute bore to tolerable.

tmdb28039023,1.0,"Death on the Nile has a prologue set in World War I, where a young Hercule Poirot is played by a digitally ‘de-aged’ Kenneth Branagh. Et tu, Kenneth? If you must do this, why not get a younger actor who looks likes Branagh? Or even one who doesn’t look like the Northern Irish writer/director/actor, so long as he looks like an actual human being; it’s safe to say that Branagh looks neither like himself nor like a member of the human race (he actually looks less grotesque after an explosion disfigures one side of his face). Again, this is only if you must do this – but then, you mustn’t do it, especially considering that this prologue exists only, and I kid you not, as an origin story for Poirot’s mustache.

In order to catch up with Branagh’s current appearance, the character then ages some 40 years in the space of about two decades, and in the interim it’s the world around him that has received a digital facelift – in particular Egypt, whose entire topography and everything in it, including flora, fauna, bodies of water, architecture, historical landmarks, etc., etc., has been computer-generated, and very crudely at that. They should have called this Death on Denial, because based on the evidence of this movie, the Nile isn’t a river in Egypt – or a river at all, nor Egypt a place that bears any resemblance to any known landscape that can be found on planet Earth.

As for the actual plot, who cares? It's impossible to believe in the existence of these characters as real persons because they're all clearly actors standing in front of green screens, and the ""Death"" of the title is rendered meaningless because it takes place in a lifeless world. Even an Agatha Christie murder mystery – nay, especially an Agatha Christie murder mystery demands a plausible backdrop, and in that sense a matte painting, rear projection, miniatures, any number indeed of practical special effects would offer a much more tangible setting for this story – the next best thing, as a matter of fact, to actually shooting on location (which admittedly is not always feasible).",2022-08-27T06:39:49.354Z,505026,2 stars,0.28622201085090637

A detailed story told by a swindler's victims, and technically the criminal himself, with the absolutely _harrowing_ voice messages he sent. Despite the length of nearly two hours, I was engaged and invested all the way. I felt the sadness, frustration and fear of these women. This documentary is doing a favor to everyone, who might benefit from knowing one of the patterns these scammers use, and everyone, who is unable to see this problem existing in the first place.

This is a really well put together documentary. One thing that had me suspicious about it was _the title_ of it. I really didn't believe this was going to be good based on that alone, but I was happy to be proven wrong.

Chris Sawin,3.0,"With Moonfall, Roland Emmerich has essentially made an even dumber version of Michael Bay’s Armageddon. There’s not a lot to enjoy here apart from K.C. Houseman’s house cat being named Fuzz Aldrin. With its idiotic premise, hammy dialogue involving some of the most exaggerated emotional speeches ever, stiff acting, unfunny humor, and purposely distorted CGI, Moonfall features an overwhelming amount of frenetic nonsense and has no excuse to be as boring as it is.

Luckily I watched it on an IMAX cinema so the screen was huge and the sound was great, dialague was loud and clear. It had an entense tone to it to keep my attention. There were jokes here and there, but nothing major to distract me at all. I liked that it starts a bit slow and builds up, the second half is what remind me why I go to the cinemas, non-stop action and greatly done shots that you wish to put on your computer screen. It's science fiction film that captivates your imagination. The plot and ideas I found very interesting. I enjoyed the movie, so I would recommend to catch it in the cinemas. Bigger cinema, the better. My only complaint is that it couldn't take advantage of the full IMAX screen that was available, probably due to budget constraints.",2022-02-09T11:10:03.254Z,406759,4 stars,0.673784613609314
r96sk,6.0,"A bit messy, this.

<em>'Moonfall'</em> is actually good in areas that I was expecting it to be bad in and bad in areas I thought it might've been good in. I had caught one of the trailers - at the cinema for a different film - and didn't hold high hopes for it, especially with the <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/dont-look-up-2021/"" rel=""nofollow"">Don't Look Up</a>'</em> similarity, though thought the humour/silliness might carry it over the line.

Yet, the humour is poor and it's in fact the more serious elements that come to the fore. I honestly enjoyed the sci-fi bits of it and the more dramatic stuff. The comedy is very lame, I don't think I even smirked once to be honest. They should've just played it totally straight, in my opinion anyway. The special effects, meanwhile, are a positive.

The cast, when not comedic, work fairly well together. Halle Berry, John Bradley - who may be at the front of the limp jokes but he as an actor is likeable enough that I didn't dislike him at all - and Patrick Wilson - who I always forget the name of, I was literally trying to recall him throughout the film and I still didn't crack it - are a solid trio when serious. The support cast, spearheaded by Michael Peña, are meh.

Unfortunately it's a 6/10 rating from me. I do like disaster movies - <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/2012/"" rel=""nofollow"">2012</a>'</em>, Roland Emmerich's best, is great - but this one fell short; particularly towards the end. I wouldn't, personally, say it's as bad as that average rating chart suggests, but to each their own of course.",2022-02-18T00:16:34.839Z,406759,3 stars,0.6197985410690308

""Moonfall is as insanely nonsensical as one could hope/expect, but it's the lack of entertaining sequences for most of the runtime that brings the film down. The balance between the different, simultaneous action set pieces suffers immensely due to the underdeveloped, bland characters, and the incoherent, messy editing work doesn't help.

Disaster movies always ask for suspension of disbelief, but Roland Emmerich really stretches the absurdity levels by co-writing one of the most scientifically ridiculous screenplays in the history of cinema - the third act revelations are genuinely jaw-dropping.

A surprisingly dull disaster flick across the board, whether it's about the story, action, or even the performances.""

Per Gunnar Jonsson,7.0,"Is this a good movie? Well, if you expect some reasonable scientific accuracy or a story that is logical then hell no! If however you only seek two hours of entertaining action-adventure and a shitload of special effects, then it is a pretty good movie.

The story behind this movie is ludicrous to say the least. There are so many holes in it, so much scientific bullshit and so much illogical behaviour by everyone involved that this would be a very, very long post should I list them all.

By the way, the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two if you have not yet seen the movie.

Even if we ignore the absolutely nonsensical notion that you could actually cram a white dwarf star into the moon without it affecting Earth, like tearing it apart, the story is ludicrous to say the least.

I would say that the notion that NASA, after the space shuttle clearly being hit by a foreign object would not only decide to hide behind some bullshit human error excuse but also get away with it is rubbish. But then, after two years with a senile sock puppet claiming to be the president of the United States and seeing how one lie after another, each one more obvious and ludicrous than the next, have been spewed out as well as bolstered by a completely biased, borderline criminal, mainstream media and tech industry, maybe it is not that far fetched.

Then we of course have the usual Hollywood “features” like a main character that starts off by being a reckless and utterly stupid moron, people just standing there and staring, and doing nothing, at bad things approaching and so on and so forth.

However, if you put your brain in idle, something that you have to do more often than not when it comes to Hollywood movies today, this is actually a quite entertaining movie. At least as far as I am concerned.

Yes, it is predictable as hell but it is still a good action-adventure and the nonsensical story behind it allows for some unusual and spectacular special effects. The special effects are of course making up for most of the stars I was willing to give this movie. It is more or less the reason to watch it.

One good thing about the movie though, is that it is refreshingly void of woke and political bullshit preaching. No green propaganda or gender or race crap. Well unless you count the US military being portrayed as the usual morons that they are in Hollywood movies of course. Seriously? Even if you managed to fire Earth’s entire nuclear arsenal into the moon it would have zero effect. But then again, with woke asshats like General Milley you never know.

Bottom line, despite the absence of science a ludicrous story, to me, this was a quite entertaining (science) fiction movie with plenty of special effects and action.",2023-02-13T14:20:38.409Z,406759,3 stars,0.4058536887168884

tmdb28039023,1.0,"At the risk of sounding like a purist, Jackass Forever is one comeback too many. I’m aware that expecting purity from this franchise is akin to drawing blood from the proverbial stone, but even when taken on its own terms, it’s safe to say that there is no Jackass without Bam Margera and Ryan Dunn – just like there wouldn’t be any Jackass sans Johnny Knoxville or Steve-O. To its credit, JF doesn’t try to replace the irreplaceable, but it does attempt to fix what’s not broken by injecting ‘new blood’ into the cast (come to think of it, it's definitely broken, and it doesn't get fixed either).

Thus, we get a new fat guy, even though the old fat guy is still around (and still round). Why? You already have a fat dude; you don’t need two fat dudes. Similarly, with the likes of Dave England, known for his ability – if one can call it that – to defecate on cue, what need is there for a Dave England-lookalike named Poopies? All of this makes as much sense as having another little person on set other than Wee Man – and again, I know that ‘sense’ doesn’t enter the equation here, but just because the performers are dumb enough to do what they do to themselves, it doesn’t mean that the fan base, among whose numbers I count myself, is too dumb to have its intelligence insulted.

There is no point in introducing newcomers this late in the game, especially considering that, as JF makes abundantly clear, watching random strangers suffering grievous bodily harm isn’t all that funny; ironically, it’s much funnier when it happens to people you have come to know and actually like over the years – and even then the novelty has doubtless finally worn off (and it certainly had a damn good run); there is a lot more deja vu in the proceedings than there is nostalgia. All things considered, I was considerably more entertained by Knoxville’s match with Sami Zayn at Wrestlemania 38 than by Jackass Forever.",2022-08-27T05:44:41.746Z,656663,4 stars,0.4149390161037445

r96sk,6.0,"I've been expecting a drop-off from this series and it has finally come. Admittedly, it still isn't all that bad.

<em>'Hotel Transylvania: Transformania'</em> is basically what I expected its past entries to be like, at least the most recent two. I mentioned in my <em>'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/hotel-transylvania-3-summer-vacation/"" rel=""nofollow"">Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation</a>'</em> review that the watchable plots were the only thing I was enjoying about these flicks (cast/characters being extremely meh, same again here) so one was bound to slip up eventually.

This one I found to be quite boring, if not terrible. Focusing heavily on just Dracula and Johnny was a bad call, especially given Adam Sandler's absence as the former. I actually wouldn't have predicted that the film would've missed Sandler (given my aforementioned thoughts), but it's a case of you don't know what you've got until you lose it because Brian Hull is a lame replacement; nothing against him personally, of course!

The setting of South America just takes out any <em>'Hotel Transylvania'</em>-y vibes too, so another wrong decision in my opinion. Here, the story isn't interesting enough to, like across 1 to 3, cover for the gaps in location, cast, characters etc. - at least in my eyes.

Chris Sawin,2.0,"It would have been so incredibly satisfying if Disney had debuted an _Ice Age_ film with solid animation, laugh out loud humor, a well-written story, and likeable or even downright despicable characters. Having those elements would have at least given fans of the franchise thus far hope that Disney had a vision of where to take Ice Age in the foreseeable future. Instead we get this lackluster dud of a film that is boring to look at and is mostly massively unfunny while making most of the characters – old and new – forgettable. When Zee first meets Crash and Eddie, Buck says something along the lines of, “What they lack in courage they make up for with bumbling ineptitude.” That is all _The Adventures of Buck Wild_ is; an unnecessary animated excursion into bumbling ineptitude.

tmdb28039023,2.0,"Redeeming Love looks great. It features great locations shot with great cinematography, but that’s about all director D.J. Caruso can do to entice us to keep watching. It’s terrific to see a story unfolding in a non-CGI, true-to-life setting, even if it’s Cape Town standing in for California (but then some of the greatest westerns were filmed in Europe, so there’s that), but while this movie arguably achieves the western look, it fails to conjure up any sort of western feel.

The script concerns a Hooker with a Heart of Gold known as Angel, who is so sought after that the local Madame, who calls herself Duchess, holds a daily raffle to determine which lucky slack-jawed gold miners – there is more than one winner per day – get to hold sexual congress with her. This is such a cumbersome arrangement that it actually gets in the way of the plot, so that co-writers Francine Rivers and Caruso Hand Wave it not long after they have introduced it.

So-called “dirt farmer” Michael Hosea becomes smitten with Angel, so what does he do to get near her? Does he buy all the numbers in the raffle? Does he have the raffle rigged? No and no; he simply “pays double”. That’s it. Why this hasn’t occurred to at least some of the yokels who form a daily scrum outside the brothel is anybody’s guess. Another good question is where Michael, who is not a miner, finds enough “gold dust” to gain access to Angel on three different occasions.

Angel wants nothing to do with Michael owing to a deep-seated hatred and distrust of men, which is established in a series of flashbacks that are so many and so long they could make up an entire, separate movie all by themselves. They are also the reason that Redeeming Love unnecessarily breaks the 120-minute mark. But the oddest part about these flashbacks is that they show Angel escaping a life of compulsory whoredom only to enter a life of voluntary whoredom. Twice. Maybe even thrice, but that last time is once again against her will. In any case, it gets to be quite repetitive after a while.

It is only after Angel gets the tar beaten out of her by the Duchess’s lackey Magowan that she relents and agrees to marry Michael – but first he has to pay off her “debt” to the Duchess, and the irony that he literally buys Angel off in order to make an honest woman out of her is lost on Michael and Caruso alike.

Redeeming Love’s greatest achievement, other than its photography, is how well it masks its biblical pedigree. According to Wikipedia this is a “Christian Western” based on an homonymous novel by Rivers (unread by me, though it wouldn’t surprise if she had first published it under the pseudonym F.R. Ancine), which in turn is inspired by an obscure Old Testament book – not that you would even guess at any of this by watching the movie, and that’s actually a good thing. It may be long and boring, but at least it’s not overtly preachy.",2022-08-28T06:17:59.796Z,698508,4 stars,0.5274332761764526

William Hurt crops up here, too, and Benjamin Walker provides some eye candy - but the story is Disney-lite, there is way too much verbiage and although Brosnan tries to ham it all up, he just looks like he couldn't care less about any of it - a feeling with which I could pretty readily associate.

His pal Anthony Hayes and he try to move it, but it's just too big. Plan? Well Hayes decides to head to the nearest town to try and procure some heavy lifting equipment and leaves Zac to keep watch. Hmmm? Well, anyway Hayes isn't exactly rushing back to his friend who is gradually running out of food, water, having hallucinations, fending off wild dogs and even a rogue Irish women as his grasp on reality starts to slip... Efron is actually not bad as the man who gradually succumbs to despair and dehydration, but the story plods along far too slowly for almost eighty minutes before the last ten minutes provide a denouement with a bit of a twist to the tale. It is good that Efron is pushing himself away from his pretty boy roles - indeed the make-up folks here do such a good job that I doubt even a biblical leper would welcome him into their home, but the story all takes way too long to get going and the it, quite literally, crawls along. The production does look good - the desert photography has an almost naturally sepia colour to it that emphasises just how hostile this terrain is and the narrative does say something about the degree to which greed is hard wired into our psyche though; and the perils we will endure or permit to obtain wealth.

garethmb,-1.0,"It is hard to believe it has been 25 years since “Scream” premiered and in doing so; brought new life into the slasher genre which had become stale due to an abundance of direct to DVD and cable releases combined with many uninspired and stale theatrical releases.

The movie was a massive success and launched a very successful trilogy and made the Ghostface killer and many moments from the series Pop Culture mainstays.

After a hiatus; “Scream 4” arrived and continued the series and in 2022; “Scream” has arrived which continues the story to the eager anticipation of fans.

When a young girl named Tara (Jenna Ortega); is brutally attacked in a fashion very similar to the Ghostface Killer; her sister Sam (Melissa Barrera); returns to Woodsboro to be by her side while Tara recuperates.

Sam is joined by her boyfriend Richie (Jack Quaid), who has no idea about the history of Woodsboro nor the popular “Stab” film series that is based on the events of the murders that have plagued the town.

Sam’s past troubles makes her return difficult and when Ghostface strikes again; she and Richie seek the help of Dewey (David Arquette); who has fallen on hard times and has split from Gayle (Courtney Cox). Despite his reluctance; Dewey gets involved and tells Sam the “rules” which would indicate the killer might be someone she knows and soon everyone in her and Tara’s circle becomes suspect even as the deaths start to increase.

This allows for some of the best moments of the film as the characters make references to several other modern and past horror franchises and discuss things from online Trolls, rabid fans, and other Pop Culture references which provides some tongue in cheek humor about the series and also establishes the world of “Scream” as one where people are well-versed in horror films old and new and have modified the rules based on sequel, prequel, and “Requel” rules for films.

As tensions and body count mounts; Gayle, Dewey, and Sidney (Neve Campbell) must face their fears to stop Ghostface before it is too late.

While the final act of the film is very over the top and at times absurd; it does provide plenty of the elements that fans have come to expect from the series. I was able to accurately see and predict almost all of the twists very early in the film and did not have many surprises as the film unfolded; I think many will still find enough enjoyment watching the tale unfold as after four films I have a pretty good idea of the formula for the series and also have many years of this as I saw the twists in “The Sixth Sense” and “The Village” very early in the films so I just seem to have a knack for this sort of thing.

While it does not break much in the way of new ground; the film does deliver what fans have come to expect and I did find in more enjoyable than “Scream 3” and there was more than enough to keep me entertained. There have been rumors that a sixth film has already been planned and if so: I will be more than ready for more.

Boasting a continuously entertaining screenplay filled with exceptionally captivating, relevant dialogue and some of the goriest, bloodiest murders in the famous saga, the directors (Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Tyler Gillett) and writers (James Vanderbilt, Guy Busick) pay a beautiful homage to the influential creator Wes Craven.

The whole cast - both newcomers and icons - delivers remarkable performances, portraying characters who unapologetically address admittedly cinephile-driven topics that some occasional moviegoers might not fully understand but will still receive pure entertainment on the big screen.

Chris Sawin,4.0,"Ghostface is my favorite cinematic serial killer and I love the first four films (yes, even _Scream 3_ and Gale’s terrible bangs) despite their flaws and fluctuating factors of entertainment. I’ll see and support any new _Scream_ film or TV series that comes along because of it. I know this new installment was successful ($88.4 million worldwide box office gross as of this writing) and some enjoyed it, but it is honestly my least favorite in the franchise.

This new film feels like it’s trying too hard to be one of the original _Scream_ films when it should have just been more of its own thing. This is something the film addresses, but originality should always triumph over retreading familiar territory; especially when it seems like its kills are being plunged into the same stab wounds.

I loved the first Scream - the surprise, the shock, the self-awareness, the humor. It reinvented horror and launched a franchise of sequels of varying quality. And this newest one is the best since the first! It captured all the fun of the first. It kept the stakes high by bringing back the original cast and proving that no one is truly safe. The directors had fun baiting the audience with every slasher trope they could. Tense music would rise every time a character walked past a dark doorway or opened a cabinet to hide the view from the hall - naturally, that is when the killer is standing on the other side but not in Scream! Playing with the tropes in a fun, self-aware way is what Scream is all about, and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett nailed it.",2022-08-20T00:36:18.952Z,646385,5 stars,0.7859674096107483
tmdb28039023,6.0,"Some things never change. This can be good and also bad. Bad like Audibly Sharp knives (i.e., blades that make a sharpening noise when being whisked through thin air), or like when former deputy Dewey Riley (David Arquette) says “You have to shoot 'em in the head, or they always come back.” Of course, the very existence of the new Scream is irrefutable proof that they will come back regardless. This movie is slasher history repeating itself in more ways than one; in addition to revisiting this particular franchise, it borrows a key plot point from Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare – that I will not reveal but which you may have inkling about if you are, like me, a student of the genre.

All of the above notwithstanding, Scream ‘22 is overall more good than bad. True to its roots, this iteration serves as a deconstruction of the current state of mainstream horror cinema. Specifically, it is a textbook example of a “requel” – like the last couple of Halloweens, or the recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre –, and by ‘textbook’ I mean that it actually includes a scene where a character literally explains what a requel is and how it works. I also like that it lampshades one of my least favorite tropes, which I call Chekhov's Inhaler.

I just compared it to Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but the fact is that Scream ‘22 comes to join the much better company of Wes Craven’s New Nightmare and last year’s Candyman (suitably, the movie is dedicated to Craven’s memory and gives Jordan Peele a shoutout). This Scream’s oft-repeated mantra is “always go back to the original,” and that’s sage advice because, like Nightmare on Elm Street, this franchise is a brainchild of Craven that began life as thinking man’s horror only to get progressively dumbed down with each new entry – unlike, say, Friday the 13th, which was born stupid.

Thankfully, this film has been made by people with knowledge of and respect for their source material, and who don’t underestimate the audience’s intelligence. Consequently, when characters send text messages, the words appear on their phone screens as opposed to our movie and TV screens, and when a someone is stabbed, they spill real fake blood instead of a stream of red pixels (and in an age where CGI is the norm, any horror movie that uses practical effects instantly doubles its visceral impact). I will only add that, also like New Nightmare and Candyman ‘21, Scream ‘22 is as much of a return to form as it is a fitting farewell, so here’s hoping that it will live up to its promise that “After tonight, no more books, no more movies, no more f***ing Ghostface.”",2022-08-28T05:31:52.060Z,646385,3 stars,0.42518460750579834
r96sk,6.0,"The cast do great, just a shame the rest of <em>'The 355'</em> isn't up to their level.

Jessica Chastain, Diane Kruger, Lupita Nyong'o, Penélope Cruz and Fan Bingbing all produce, all of them give enjoyable performances and never became uninteresting, irritating or whatever to me. They are the film's major plus. I'm struggling for other positives, cinematography at a push?

Unfortunately, I came away from watching feeling underwhelmed. The second half really drags, not helped by an extremely lame 'twist'. The first half isn't perfect but does hold potential, once the main bunch eventually team up it's more interesting. The editing is a little iffy, too.

There are quite a few talky scenes that aren't worthwhile at all, especially early on with Chastain and Sebastian Stan. Things improve when the action sequences get underway, not that they are anything extraordinary but what we see is satisfactory; it's the bits in between that let this 2022 release down.

6/10, despite the well performing cast; who almost made me give this 7/10.",2022-01-18T12:50:23.012Z,522016,3 stars,0.5378432273864746
JPV852,5.0,"Pretty lifeless global action-thriller where it seemed co-writer and director Simon Kinberg was attempting to emulate the Bourne franchise (the cinematography and score especially reminded me of that series). 

The story is thin, predictable and really sounded familiar but can't put my finger on what (thinking Casino Royale with the short selling of stocks at least), but a thin story is fine (a few of the Mission Impossible movies didn't have the strongest plots or villains), if only the main cast had any chemistry which I didn't feel they did, despite a few of them being solid actresses.

This yet another film that filmmakers thought would be a potential franchise as it's left open ended for a sequel. I guess there was potential and maybe under a better director would've been at least an entertaining flick, but in the end I found it to be forgettable. **2.25/5**",2022-02-20T22:45:29.831Z,522016,2 stars,0.5737797021865845
Manuel São Bento,5.0,"MORE REVIEWS @ https://www.msbreviews.com/

""The 355 holds excellent performances from all people involved - especially Jessica Chastain (It: Chapter Two) and Lupita Nyong'o (Us). However, the generic screenplay, poor dialogues, and barely developed characters turn a film with much potential into another disappointment from Simon Kinberg (The New Mutants).

The action sequences actually include interesting choreography, but the use of quick cuts and shaky cam doesn't always work favorably. The narrative is loaded with the usual formulas of the respective genre, and some attempts to approach the theme of feminism efficiently fall flat.

Personally, it's saved by the fact that it was primarily filmed in real locations, helping with the entertainment levels.""

FuraX,-1.0,"An all women movie, I might just love it. Specially when I think Chastain and Kruger are people I just love watching .. usually.

Some action, some tension, yeah !! But it's so fake, you'd think it's a Chinese production : globalization is so good to us.

Now, when you add a hint of a progressive agenda, it just becomes so much better .. At least it brings some kind of a content. Yeah, content here is mostly replaced by contempt.

These women are charismatic and attractive (except BingBing who's just a pain for my sorry eyes and ears) and need to stick together .. how intriguing (stick what ? not sure yet). If only we could believe these characters more then 10 minutes.

Now if you withdraw the story, it's all fine, everybody else did a good job.

An action movie written by a lazy teenager helped by his assertive mum, how come anyone followed ?",2022-04-10T21:02:38.134Z,522016,2 stars,0.46601250767707825

The Movie Mob,6.0,"**While The 355 might not have been a stand-out blockbuster of a film, it still was enjoyable.**

The 355 hit almost every line of dialogue and every typical character type you have seen in a spy movie but still found a way to entertain its audience, even if it was only slightly entertaining. The cast was stellar, and the performances were solid. Unfortunately, the 355 stumbles with a stale, unimaginative script that is incredibly predictable and keeps the peril and danger from feeling very perilous or dangerous. I didn’t finish the movie feeling I had wasted my time, but I couldn’t say I would recommend it. Jessica Chastain, Lupita Nyong’o, and the rest of the cast seemed to have fun working on this project together, and their chemistry was entertaining. Still, the trite dialogue kept all of it from being great. I wish The 355 had been trusted with a bigger budget and a more experienced director. It had enough strengths that even with all its flaws, it was a decent film, but it could have easily been a great movie.",2022-11-23T23:11:48.896Z,522016,3 stars,0.5572587847709656
